# The Task

I am a Data Scientist designing a reproducible data ingestion pipeline. I want to interactively configure data source connections, sampling parameters, and preprocessing steps without writing boilerplate code each time. This code repository offers a highly configurable CLI form toolkit to build that interactive setup quickly.

# The Requirements

* `ask_text` : A single-line prompt for things like table names, file paths, or regex-based column filters, with length limits and placeholder hints.
* `branch_flow` : Conditional sections for different ingestion modes (batch vs streaming), which appear or reorder based on earlier inputs.
* `load_choices_async` : On-demand loading of available database schemas, S3 buckets, or message queues, complete with loading spinners and result caching.
* `input_line_fallback` : A fallback stdin/stdout mode so notebooks, Docker containers, or headless servers can still run the setup.
* `review_submission` : A final review screen showing chosen sources, sample sizes, and transformations, all editable inline before launching the ETL job.
* `ask_password` : Securely enter service account keys or database passwords, with an optional strength meter and toggle to reveal the input.
* `select_choices` : Multi-select list for choosing feature engineering steps or sampling strategies, navigable via arrow keys.
* `set_renderer_theme` : Ability to apply a minimal or high-contrast theme that blends with Jupyter terminal themes or corporate style guides.
* `register_on_change` : Callbacks to recompute default partition keys or adjust downstream options when earlier fields change.
* `format_errors` : Custom error templates to highlight invalid paths, mismatched schemas, or unsupported file formats with colorized hints.
