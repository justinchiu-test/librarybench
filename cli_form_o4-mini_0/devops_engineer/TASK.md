# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer responsible for automating and validating Kubernetes cluster deployments via CLI. I want to be able to build an interactive, resilient wizard that guides me through setting up environment variables, picking cloud providers, entering credentials, and reviewing the entire config before applying it. This code repository provides a modular CLI form library to assemble that workflow quickly and reliably.

# The Requirements

* `ask_text` : A basic single-line text input that supports optional length limits, regex patterns, and placeholder hints for things like cluster names or region codes.
* `branch_flow` : Complex flows where entire sections (e.g., cloud-specific settings for AWS, GCP, Azure) can appear or reorder based on earlier answers or detected environment variables.
* `load_choices_async` : Fetch option lists on-demand from provider APIs or internal inventory databases, with loading indicators and caching strategies for things like available VM types.
* `input_line_fallback` : A pure-stdin/stdout prompt mode that gracefully degrades when curses isn’t available, so our CI pipelines can still drive the wizard non‐interactively.
* `review_submission` : A summary view listing all collected answers, editable inline before final submission to `kubectl` or Terraform.
* `ask_password` : Obscured input field for secret keys or tokens, with an optional strength meter and show/hide toggle.
* `select_choices` : A navigable choice list widget for single or multi-select of regions, instance types, or feature flags.
* `set_renderer_theme` : Support for custom color palettes, border styles, and layout adjustments to match our corporate branding or dark‐mode preferences.
* `register_on_change` : Hooks triggered when a field’s value changes, enabling dynamic updates (e.g., auto‐populate default ports) or side effects (like fetching a new list of subnets).
* `format_errors` : Global and per-field templates for error messages, including rich text markers, colorized output, or inline hints for invalid CIDR blocks.
