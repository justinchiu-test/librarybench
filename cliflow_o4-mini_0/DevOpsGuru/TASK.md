# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer. I want to automate infrastructure workflows, deploy microservices, and produce machine-readable reports for CI/CD pipelines. This code repository gives me flexible CLI tools to script tasks, integrate with YAML configurations, and produce JSON outputs for automated checks.

# The Requirements

* `set_renderer`           : Switch between colorized terminal output, plain text, JSON for CI pipelines, or Markdown for runbooks.  
* `pipe`                   : Chain the output of an infra-check command into a compliance-validator with built-in serialization.  
* `parallelize`            : Execute independent provisioning steps (e.g., VPC, IAM, DNS) in parallel with minimal boilerplate.  
* `secure_input`           : Prompt for secrets (Vault tokens, SSH keys) with masking and guarantee secure memory cleanup.  
* `translate`              : Localize CLI help and status updates for global operations teams.  
* `export_workflow`        : Produce Markdown or HTML runbooks from defined deploy flows for stakeholder review.  
* `load_config`            : Consume JSON, YAML, TOML, or INI config files to define environment-specific defaults.  
* `env_inject`             : Auto-map environment variables (e.g., KUBECONFIG, AWS_REGION) to CLI flags.  
* `load_plugins`           : Extend core CLI with custom deployment or monitoring plugins via dynamic discovery.  
* `redirect_io`            : Redirect logs and error streams to centralized log files or monitoring services.
