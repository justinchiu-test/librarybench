# The Task

I am a Plugin Developer. I want to extend a CLI framework with new commands, custom renderers, and data transformers. This code repository provides a plugin-first architecture, runtime discovery, and easy integration points.

# The Requirements

* `set_renderer`           : Register and plug in new output renderers (e.g., XML, CSV, custom dashboards).  
* `pipe`                   : Enable my plugin’s commands to accept piped input and produce serializable output.  
* `parallelize`            : Annotate plugin tasks so they can run concurrently with core commands.  
* `secure_input`           : Use built-in secure prompts for plugin configuration (tokens, secrets) and auto-cleanup.  
* `translate`              : Hook into the i18n system so my plugin’s messages appear in multiple languages.  
* `export_workflow`        : Include plugin steps in exported Markdown or HTML workflow documentation.  
* `load_config`            : Support plugin-specific settings loaded from JSON, YAML, TOML, or INI files.  
* `env_inject`             : Let users map environment variables to my plugin’s parameters automatically.  
* `load_plugins`           : Demonstrate dynamic discovery and loading of nested plugin bundles.  
* `redirect_io`            : Provide hooks to redirect plugin IO streams to files or custom handlers.
