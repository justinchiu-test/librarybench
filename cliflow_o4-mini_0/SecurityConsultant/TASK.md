# The Task

I am a Security Consultant. I want to audit and enforce security policies across multiple microservices, mask sensitive data during scans, and produce tamper-resistant reports. This code repository offers secure input handling, configurable pipelines, and flexible reporting.

# The Requirements

* `set_renderer`           : Choose a colorized summary, plain-text audit log, JSON for SIEM ingestion, or Markdown report.  
* `pipe`                   : Chain vulnerability scanner output into compliance checkers with automated serialization.  
* `parallelize`            : Perform port scans, secret detection, and policy checks concurrently.  
* `secure_input`           : Prompt for detection thresholds and API credentials with masking and zero-memory footprint.  
* `translate`              : Localize alerts and remediation instructions for global teams.  
* `export_workflow`        : Generate documented audit workflows in Markdown or HTML for client handover.  
* `load_config`            : Load scan profiles and risk thresholds from JSON, YAML, TOML, or INI.  
* `env_inject`             : Map environment variables (SCAN_TARGET, API_TOKEN) directly to command flags.  
* `load_plugins`           : Dynamically load vulnerability-check plugins or custom policy enforcers.  
* `redirect_io`            : Redirect STDOUT/STDERR to secure log files or SIEM endpoints.
