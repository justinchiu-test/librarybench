# The Task

I am a Product Manager coordinating cross-functional teams to deliver consistent developer experiences.  
I want to be able to document, standardize, and distribute CLI workflows so that each team follows best practices.  
This code repository acts as a central hub for workflow definitions, plugin governance, and user guides.

# The Requirements

* `generate_completion` : Ship ready-to-install completions so users get instant help in their shells.  
* `export_workflow_docs` : Auto-generate onboarding materials in Markdown/HTML from live workflows.  
* `discover_plugins` : Audit and certify third-party plugins before theyâ€™re enabled in our CLI.  
* `redirect_io` : Define how workflows log output, errors, and artifacts for compliance tracking.  
* `use_profile` : Provide out-of-the-box dev, staging, and prod configurations for all teams.  
* `serialize_data` : Ensure JSON/CSV/YAML input-output formats are enforced by policy.  
* `check_version` : Surface update prompts so teams never drift from approved CLI versions.  
* `manage_marketplace` : Curate an internal plugin marketplace with ratings, descriptions, and reviews.  
* `register_hooks` : Attach reporting and metrics collection at key lifecycle stages.  
* `run_tests` : Validate workflow changes with built-in test harness before publishing to prod.
