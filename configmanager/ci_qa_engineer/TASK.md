# The Task

I am a CI/QE Engineer designing automated tests for configuration management across our delivery pipelines.  
I want to programmatically load, merge, and validate every combination of feature flags, environment overrides, and secret injection scenarios. This code repository will let me script complex merge cases, get detailed logs on failures, and hot-reload configs during test runs.

# The Requirements

* `merge_configs`         : Programmatically combine defaults, feature-flag files, and environment overrides.  
* `setup_logging`         : Emit structured logs for loads, merges, validation errors, and reload events, to be parsed by our test harness.  
* `enable_hot_reload`     : Auto-reload and re-merge configs when test fixtures or source files change.  
* `export_env_vars`       : Generate `KEY=VALUE` pairs to drive container-based test jobs.  
* `export_to_ini`         : Write merged configurations to INI for YAML/INI cross-validation tests.  
* `select_profile`        : Run tests against multiple profiles (dev, staging, prod) in a single pipeline.  
* `cache_manager`         : Cache and reuse expensive loads (e.g. large mock data sets) across test iterations.  
* `register_plugin`       : Inject custom validation plugins or secret-mocking backends.  
* `set_precedence`        : Define and test custom per-key precedence rules.  
* `fetch_secret`          : Simulate fetching secrets from Vault/AWS/Azure and validate fallback behaviors.
