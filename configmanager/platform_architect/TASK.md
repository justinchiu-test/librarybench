# The Task

I am a Platform Architect designing a shared configuration backbone for multiple teams and microservices. I want a single repository that enforces schema compliance, supports plugins, provides granular namespaces, logs every change, snapshots states, and exposes overrides via CLI or code. This code repository is the cornerstone of our platformâ€™s configuration strategy.

# The Requirements

* `register_plugin`            : Expose hooks for custom source loaders (Git, S3, HTTP API), merge strategies, or alerting integrations.  
* `validate_config`            : Define and enforce robust JSON-schema or custom schemas to guarantee global config integrity.  
* `export_to_env`              : Emit standardized `KEY=VALUE` pairs or update `os.environ` for services on startup.  
* `log_event`                  : Centralized, structured logs capturing loads, merges, validation errors, reloads, and plugin events.  
* `get_namespace`              : Organize shared settings into multi-level namespaces (`auth.oauth`, `logging.format`, `feature.flags`).  
* `snapshot`                   : Provide immutable snapshots of the entire platform config to support audits and concurrent reads.  
* `load_toml_source`           : Seamlessly load and merge TOML files alongside JSON and environment sources.  
* `diff_changes`               : Compute and log deltas between versions on every reload, with audit metadata.  
* `override_config`            : Enable dynamic programmatic overrides for staged rollouts or canary tests.  
* `parse_cli_args`             : Integrate CLI parsing (via `argparse`) so teams can override settings at service startup.
