# The Task

I am a DevOps Engineer responsible for multi-environment deployments. I want to be able to consolidate configuration from YAML, JSON, TOML, environment variables, and command-line flags into a single coherent state for staging, QA, and production. This code repository gives me a modular, extensible manager that validates, merges, logs, snapshots, and exposes my settings exactly as I need.

# The Requirements

* `register_plugin`            : Hook in custom source loaders (e.g. Vault, Consul), merge strategies, or notification mechanisms for secrets or metrics.  
* `validate_config`            : Define and enforce JSON-schema or custom schemas to ensure every service config abides by our standards before rollout.  
* `export_to_env`              : Generate shell-style `KEY=VALUE` lines for deployment scripts or update `os.environ` in ephemeral containers.  
* `log_event`                  : Emit structured logs for config loads, merges, validation errors, and reload eventsâ€”integrated with ELK/Prometheus.  
* `get_namespace`              : Organize keys into hierarchical namespaces (e.g. `database.postgres`, `microservice.api`) for per-team modular access.  
* `snapshot`                   : Take immutable, read-only snapshots of the current config to safely compare pre- and post-deployment states.  
* `load_toml_source`           : Load and merge TOML configuration files (via the `toml` package) alongside JSON/YAML sources.  
* `diff_changes`               : Compute and log change deltas between previous and updated config states on reload, tagged by environment.  
* `override_config`            : Programmatically override individual keys or entire sections at runtime for hotfixes or blue-green switches.  
* `parse_cli_args`             : Parse command-line arguments (via `argparse`) and apply them on top of all other sources for one-off injections.
