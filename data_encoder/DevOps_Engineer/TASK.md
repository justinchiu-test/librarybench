# The Task

I am a DevOps Engineer responsible for ensuring seamless integration and deployment of applications. I want to implement integration tests to verify compatibility with various systems and handle data streams efficiently. This code repository provides the necessary tools for integration testing and streaming support.

# The Requirements

* `integration_tests()` : Implement integration tests to verify system compatibility.
* `stream_decode(data_stream)` : Decode data streams to facilitate real-time data processing.
* `compression_option(data)` : Use compression to optimize data storage and transfer.
* `endianness_handling(data, endianness='big')` : Ensure data compatibility across different systems with endianness support.
