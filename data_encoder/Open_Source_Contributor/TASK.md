# The Task

I am an open-source contributor passionate about enhancing tools for the community. I want to be able to extend the functionality of this tool and collaborate with others. This code repository encourages community contributions and provides guidelines for doing so.

# The Requirements

* `contribute_guidelines()` : Encourage community contributions and provide guidelines for extending the tool's functionality.
* `unit_tests()` : Develop a suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability of encoding and decoding functions.
