# The Task

I am a Backend Developer working on a system that processes complex nested data structures. I want to be able to efficiently encode and decode these structures while ensuring type correctness and data integrity. This code repository provides the tools needed to handle such data efficiently.

# The Requirements

* `encode_nested_structures(data)` : Allow encoding and decoding of nested data structures.
* `validate_schema(data, schema)` : Validate data against the user-defined schema to ensure type correctness during encoding.
* `check_data_integrity(encoded_data)` : Implement checks to ensure data integrity during encoding and decoding.
* `support_homogeneous_sets(data_set)` : Add support for encoding and decoding homogeneous sets.
