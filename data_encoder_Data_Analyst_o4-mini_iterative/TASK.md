# The Task

I am a data analyst who frequently works with various data formats. I want to be able to easily encode and decode datasets while ensuring data integrity and type correctness. This code repository provides the tools I need to manage and analyze data effectively.

# The Requirements

* `encode(data, config)` : Add support for encoding and decoding homogeneous sets to handle structured data efficiently.
* `decode(encoded_data)` : Add support for encoding and decoding non-homogeneous dictionaries to manage diverse data types.
* `validate(data, schema)` : Validate data against the user-defined schema to ensure type correctness during encoding.
* `document_api()` : Provide comprehensive documentation for the encoding and decoding API to facilitate ease of use and integration.
