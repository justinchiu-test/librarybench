# The Task

I am a data engineer tasked with building data pipelines that handle complex data transformations. I want to ensure data integrity and support nested structures for comprehensive data processing. This code repository provides the essential features needed to maintain high-quality data pipelines.

# The Requirements

* `data_integrity_checks(data)` : Implement checks to ensure data integrity during encoding and decoding.
* `nested_structures(data)` : Allow encoding and decoding of nested data structures.
* `streaming_support(data_stream)` : Implement support for encoding and decoding data streams.
* `encoding_configuration(settings)` : Provide options to configure encoding settings, such as compression level.
