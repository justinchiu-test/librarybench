# The Task

I am a data scientist working with large datasets across various programming environments. I want to be able to seamlessly encode and decode data in different languages while ensuring data integrity. This code repository helps me manage complex data transformations and ensures my data remains consistent and accurate across platforms.

# The Requirements

* `cross_language_support(data, format)` : Ensure the encoded format can be decoded in multiple programming languages.
* `data_integrity_checks(data)` : Implement checks to ensure data integrity during encoding and decoding.
* `nested_structures(data)` : Allow encoding and decoding of nested data structures.
* `unit_testing()` : Develop a suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability of encoding and decoding functions.
