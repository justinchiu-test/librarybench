# The Task

I am an Embedded Systems Developer working on devices that communicate using binary data. I want to ensure that data is correctly encoded and decoded, regardless of the endianness of the system. This code repository provides the tools to handle binary data efficiently, with support for nested structures and robust error handling.

# The Requirements

* `encode_binary(data, schema)` : Encode binary data with support for different endianness formats.
* `decode_binary(encoded_data, schema)` : Decode binary data, ensuring compatibility with the system's endianness.
* `handle_nested_structures(data)` : Allow encoding and decoding of nested data structures.
* `error_handling_process()` : Implement robust error handling for encoding and decoding processes.
