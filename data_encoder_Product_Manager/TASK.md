# The Task

I am a product manager overseeing the development of a data-intensive application. I want to ensure that our product can handle data efficiently and securely while providing a great user experience. This code repository provides the features necessary to achieve these goals.

# The Requirements

* `encode(data, config)` : Optimize encoding processes for speed and efficiency to enhance user experience.
* `decode(encoded_data)` : Ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of the encoding format to maintain product reliability.
* `configure_encoding(settings)` : Provide options to configure encoding settings, such as compression level, to optimize performance.
* `document_api()` : Provide comprehensive documentation for the encoding and decoding API to support developers and users.
