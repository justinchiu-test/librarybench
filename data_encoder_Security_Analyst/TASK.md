# The Task

I am a Security Analyst focused on protecting sensitive data during encoding and decoding processes. I want to ensure that data is encrypted and monitored for any suspicious activity. This code repository offers security features and logging capabilities to enhance data protection.

# The Requirements

* `encrypt_data(data, encryption_key)` : Implement security features such as data encryption during encoding.
* `log_operation(operation_type, details)` : Add logging and monitoring capabilities for encoding and decoding operations.
