# The Task

I am a Software Engineer developing applications that require seamless data exchange between different components and services. I want to ensure that data is encoded and decoded correctly, even when dealing with nested structures and different endianness formats. This code repository helps me implement reliable data handling mechanisms with support for schema versioning and metadata.

# The Requirements

* `handle_endianness(data, format)` : Support different endianness formats for binary data.
* `encode_nested(data, schema)` : Allow encoding of nested data structures, ensuring compatibility with the defined schema.
* `version_schema(schema, version)` : Manage schema changes over time with versioning support.
* `add_metadata(data, metadata)` : Include metadata in the encoded format for additional context.
