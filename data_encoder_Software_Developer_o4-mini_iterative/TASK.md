# The Task

I am a software developer working on a cross-platform application. I want to be able to encode and decode custom data types and configure decoding settings for optimal performance. This code repository allows me to tailor data processing to the specific needs of my application.

# The Requirements

* `custom_type_support(custom_type)` : Allow users to define and encode custom data types.
* `decoding_configuration(settings)` : Provide options to configure decoding settings, such as lazy loading.
* `cross_language_support(data, format)` : Ensure the encoded format can be decoded in multiple programming languages.
* `unit_testing()` : Develop a suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability of encoding and decoding functions.
