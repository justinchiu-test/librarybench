# The Task

I am a Software Engineer developing a cross-platform application that needs to communicate with various services. I want to be able to ensure that the data format used is consistent and can be decoded across different programming languages. This code repository provides the necessary tools to achieve that, enhancing compatibility and reducing potential errors.

# The Requirements

* `encode_data(data)` : Ensure the encoded format can be decoded in multiple programming languages.
* `specify_binary_format()` : Provide a detailed specification of the binary format used for encoding.
* `test_integration_with_system(system)` : Implement integration tests to verify the tool's compatibility with other systems.
