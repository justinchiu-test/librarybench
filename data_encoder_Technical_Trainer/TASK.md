# The Task

I am a Technical Trainer creating educational content for developers. I want to provide clear examples and tutorials on how to use encoding and decoding tools effectively. This code repository offers example use cases and tutorials to demonstrate its capabilities.

# The Requirements

* `example_use_cases()` : Access a variety of example use cases to demonstrate encoding and decoding features.
* `tutorials()` : Step-by-step tutorials for developers to learn how to use the tools effectively.
* `support_for_sets(data)` : Demonstrate encoding and decoding of homogeneous sets with practical examples.
* `nested_structure_handling(data)` : Show how to handle nested structures with real-world scenarios.
