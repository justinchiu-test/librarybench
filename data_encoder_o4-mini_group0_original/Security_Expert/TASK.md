# The Task

I am a security expert focused on ensuring data protection and integrity. I want to be able to implement strong security measures during data encoding and decoding processes. This code repository offers the necessary security features to safeguard data.

# The Requirements

* `encode(data, config)` : Implement security features such as data encryption during encoding to protect sensitive information.
* `decode(encoded_data)` : Ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of the encoding format to maintain data integrity.
* `configure_security(settings)` : Provide options to configure encoding settings, such as encryption level, to enhance data security.
* `stream_encode(data_stream)` : Implement support for encoding and decoding data streams to secure real-time data transmission.
