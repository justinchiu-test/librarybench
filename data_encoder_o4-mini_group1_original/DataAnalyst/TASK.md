# The Task

I am a Data Analyst who frequently works with diverse datasets that need to be transformed and validated before analysis. I want to ensure that data is correctly encoded and decoded, with support for dictionaries and type validation. This code repository offers the functionality to handle various data formats, validate types, and compress data for efficient storage.

# The Requirements

* `validate_data(data, schema)` : Validate data against the user-defined schema to ensure type correctness during encoding.
* `encode_dictionary(data)` : Add support for encoding and decoding non-homogeneous dictionaries.
* `compress_long_strings(data)` : Implement a simple compression algorithm to compress strings or long sections during encoding.
* `example_use_cases()` : Include example use cases and tutorials to demonstrate the tool's capabilities.
