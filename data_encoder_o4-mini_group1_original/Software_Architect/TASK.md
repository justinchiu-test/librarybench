# The Task

I am a Software Architect responsible for designing systems that integrate with various data encoding formats. I want to ensure that our systems remain compatible with future updates and can be easily integrated with other tools. This code repository supports backward compatibility and provides integration testing capabilities.

# The Requirements

* `ensure_backward_compatibility(current_version, previous_version)` : Ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of the encoding format.
* `run_integration_tests(test_suite)` : Implement integration tests to verify the tool's compatibility with other systems.
