# The Task

I am a system architect responsible for designing robust data processing systems. I want to be able to handle data streams efficiently and support schema versioning to manage changes over time. This code repository provides the tools I need to build scalable and maintainable systems.

# The Requirements

* `streaming_support(data_stream)` : Implement support for encoding and decoding data streams.
* `schema_versioning(schema, version)` : Allow versioning of schemas to manage changes over time.
* `endianness_handling(data, format)` : Support different endianness formats for binary data.
* `encoding_configuration(settings)` : Provide options to configure encoding settings, such as compression level.
