# The Task

I am a Bioinformatics Researcher. I want to process large-scale sequencing data in a robust, reproducible pipeline: filter reads, group by gene, calculate coverage, and export results for downstream analysis. This repository gives me all the hooks, metrics, error-tolerance, and custom plugin support I need for complex genomic workflows.

# The Requirements

* `MonitoringMetrics`       : Track read counts, error rates, per-sample processing times, and resource usage.  
* `RealTimeLogging`         : Log pipeline progress, filtering decisions, and performance metrics in structured JSON.  
* `ParallelExecution`       : Distribute alignment, filtering, and aggregation tasks across CPU cores or compute nodes.  
* `Checkpointing`           : Save intermediate alignment/artifact files so I can resume from gene-level boundaries.  
* `ErrorHandlingFallback`   : On repeated failures (e.g., bad FASTQ file), substitute a dummy read or skip to maintain workflow continuity.  
* `JSONSerialization`       : Export intermediate summaries and final results as JSON for integration with web dashboards.  
* `YAMLSerialization`       : Store pipeline configurations, sample manifests, and parameter sets in human-friendly YAML.  
* `SourceSinkHooks`         : Hook into data import (e.g., from S3 or FTP) and result export (e.g., to a remote database).  
* `BuiltInBatch`            : Batch reads into chunks of 10,000 for efficient alignment and QC steps.  
* `BuiltInSort`             : Sort reads by chromosome and position before coverage calculation.  
* `BackpressureControl`     : Slow down data ingestion if alignment tasks fall behind to prevent memory overflow.  
* `DynamicReconfiguration`  : Add or remove analysis stages (e.g., variant calling) on the fly without pipeline restart.  
* `BuiltInGroup`            : Group read alignments by gene or region, emitting per-gene coverage lists.  
* `PipelineComposition`     : Reuse sub-pipelines for QC, alignment, and annotation across different projects.  
* `ErrorHandlingSkip`       : Drop reads with too many mismatches but record the statistics for downstream QC.  
* `ErrorHandlingRetry`      : Retry intermittent file-transfer errors up to three times with exponential back-off.  
* `DataValidation`          : Validate metadata files against schemas to ensure sample IDs, barcodes, and library prep info are correct.  
* `SchemaEnforcement`       : Enforce nucleotide sequence format and required FASTQ header fields.  
* `PluginSystem`            : Plug in custom variant callers, annotation engines, or visualization exporters.  
* `CachingStage`            : Cache reference genome index lookups to speed up repeated alignments.
