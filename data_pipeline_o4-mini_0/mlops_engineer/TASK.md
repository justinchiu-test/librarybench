# The Task

I am an MLOps Engineer. I want to build robust data pipelines that feed batch and streaming features to production models, with full traceability and zero downtime updates. This code repository gives me versioned, pluggable, and resource-controlled pipelines for reliable feature delivery.

# The Requirements

* `ErrorHandlingFallback` : Populate missing feature values with model-safe defaults when upstream featurizers fail.  
* `ErrorHandlingRetry` : Retry transient database lookups or feature store writes.  
* `ErrorHandlingSkip` : Skip corrupted feature batches and log for debugging.  
* `JSONSerialization` : Dump feature vectors to JSON for model serving endpoints.  
* `BackpressureControl` : Slow down upstream data loaders when feature computation lags.  
* `DynamicReconfiguration` : Swap in new feature-engineering code or model parameters without pipeline restarts.  
* `BuiltInBatch` : Group raw records into minibatches for efficient vectorized feature transforms.  
* `BuiltInSort` : Sort training data by label or timestamp for deterministic splits.  
* `MemoryUsageControl` : Enforce memory budgets on GPU nodes, spilling features to disk if needed.  
* `Versioning` : Tag pipeline DAGs and stage configs for each model version, enabling rollbacks.  
* `Windowing` : Apply session windows for user behavior features.  
* `SamplingStage` : Draw stratified samples for offline model evaluation.  
* `BuiltInGroup` : Group user events by session ID for aggregation features.  
* `PipelineComposition` : Reuse common featurizer sub-pipelines across different models.  
* `BuiltInFilter` : Filter out training examples with missing labels or corruption.  
* `BuiltInMap` : Apply per-record feature transformations (e.g., bucketization).  
* `DataValidation` : Validate feature distributions against expected ranges or schemas.  
* `SchemaEnforcement` : Enforce schema on feature store writes, rejecting incompatible records.  
* `PluginSystem` : Extend connectors to new data sources (e.g., clickstream, logs, databases).  
* `CachingStage` : Cache lookup tables (e.g., user segments) for fast enrichment.
