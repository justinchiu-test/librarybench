# The Task

I am a community plugin author looking to extend our validation framework with custom business rules and transformers. I want a clear plugin API, localized errors, and compatibility with async checks and versioned schemas. This code repository offers an entry-point based plugin architecture and all core validation and transformation tools for me to build on.

# The Requirements

* `SchemaDiffTool` : Visualize or compute the delta between two schema definitions to support change tracking.  
* `ErrorLocalization` : Translate error messages into multiple languages via pluggable i18n backends.  
* `PluginArchitecture` : Discover and register rule and transformer plugins via entry points for community extensions.  
* `AsyncValidationSupport` : Async-capable rules for I/O bound checks (e.g. DB lookups) using asyncio.  
* `ProfileBasedRules` : Enable rule sets to vary by “profile” (e.g. signup vs. admin API) and switch context at runtime.  
* `CoreDateTimeValidation` : Date parsing (ISO, custom formats), time zone normalization, and min/max date checks.  
* `SchemaInheritance` : Define child schemas inheriting and overriding parent schemas to avoid duplication.  
* `SchemaVersioning` : Assign version IDs to schemas, manage migrations, and validate against historical versions.  
* `TransformationPipeline` : Chain transforms (e.g. trim, lowercase, date→timestamp) on valid values before output.  
* `SecureFieldMasking` : Automatic redaction or hashing of sensitive fields (e.g. SSN, credit card) in logs and reports.
