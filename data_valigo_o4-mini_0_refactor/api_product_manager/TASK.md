# The Task

I am an API product manager defining SLAs and feature requirements for our public-facing endpoints. I want to ensure schema changes are transparent, validations are context-aware, and sensitive data is always protected in our documentation and error logs. This code repository gives me the tools to version, customize, and secure our data contracts across different user profiles.

# The Requirements

* `SchemaDiffTool` : Visualize or compute the delta between two schema definitions to support change tracking.  
* `ErrorLocalization` : Translate error messages into multiple languages via pluggable i18n backends.  
* `PluginArchitecture` : Discover and register rule and transformer plugins via entry points for community extensions.  
* `AsyncValidationSupport` : Async-capable rules for I/O bound checks (e.g. DB lookups) using asyncio.  
* `ProfileBasedRules` : Enable rule sets to vary by “profile” (e.g. signup vs. admin API) and switch context at runtime.  
* `CoreDateTimeValidation` : Date parsing (ISO, custom formats), time zone normalization, and min/max date checks.  
* `SchemaInheritance` : Define child schemas inheriting and overriding parent schemas to avoid duplication.  
* `SchemaVersioning` : Assign version IDs to schemas, manage migrations, and validate against historical versions.  
* `TransformationPipeline` : Chain transforms (e.g. trim, lowercase, date→timestamp) on valid values before output.  
* `SecureFieldMasking` : Automatic redaction or hashing of sensitive fields (e.g. SSN, credit card) in logs and reports.
