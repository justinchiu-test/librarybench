# The Task

I am an IT Manager. I want to ensure that all software packages used within the organization are up-to-date and compliant with our security policies. This code repository will help me monitor and manage software dependencies across various teams.

# The Requirements

* `cross_platform_compatibility` : Ensure the package manager works seamlessly across different operating systems.
* `package_metadata_display` : Provide detailed information about packages, including version history and dependencies.
* `package_update_notifications` : Notify users when newer versions of installed packages are available.
* `package_search` : Implement a search API to find packages by name and version specifications in the registry.
* `lockfile_generation` : Provide a mechanism to freeze the current state of an environment into a lockfile for reproducibility.
