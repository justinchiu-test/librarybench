# The Task

I am a Research Scientist conducting experiments that require different software environments. I want to be able to quickly set up and switch between these environments to test various hypotheses without spending too much time on configuration. This code repository allows me to manage my environments efficiently, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in my research.

# The Requirements

* `Custom Repository Support` : Enable users to add and manage custom package repositories.
* `Package Caching` : Implement caching mechanisms to speed up repeated installations of the same packages.
* `Environment Switching` : Implement functionality to switch between different virtual environments seamlessly.
* `Batch Installation` : Allow multiple packages to be installed in a single command for efficiency.
* `Package Metadata Display` : Provide detailed information about packages, including version history and dependencies.
* `Rollback Functionality` : Provide the ability to rollback to a previous environment state in case of errors during installations.
* `Dependency Constraint Solver` : Automatically resolve and install the latest compatible versions of packages and their dependencies based on specified constraints.
* `Install from Lockfile` : Allow environments to be recreated exactly as specified in a lockfile, ensuring consistent setups.
* `User-Friendly CLI` : Develop a command-line interface that is intuitive and easy to use for managing packages and environments.
* `Offline Installation Support` : Allow package installations from local sources without requiring an internet connection.
