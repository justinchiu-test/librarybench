# The Task

I am a student learning software development. I want to experiment with different libraries and frameworks without worrying about breaking my system or dealing with complex dependency issues. This code repository provides a simple way to manage my learning environments and keep track of the packages I use.

# The Requirements

* `user_friendly_cli` : Develop a command-line interface that is intuitive and easy to use for managing packages and environments.
* `dependency_explanation` : Add a feature to explain why a package was installed, detailing its dependency chain.
* `batch_installation` : Allow multiple packages to be installed in a single command for efficiency.
* `install_from_lockfile` : Allow environments to be recreated exactly as specified in a lockfile, ensuring consistent setups.
* `environment_import` : Enable importing of environment configurations to quickly set up predefined environments.
* `package_update_notifications` : Notify users when newer versions of installed packages are available.
* `custom_repository_support` : Enable users to add and manage custom package repositories.
* `package_existence_check` : Implement a function to check if a specific package is installed in the current environment.
* `package_caching` : Implement caching mechanisms to speed up repeated installations of the same packages.
* `virtual_environment_management` : Allow creation and management of isolated environments for package installations, ensuring no global conflicts.
