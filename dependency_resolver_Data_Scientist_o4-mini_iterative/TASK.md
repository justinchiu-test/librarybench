# The Task

I am a data scientist working on various machine learning projects. I want to be able to quickly set up and manage my Python environments to ensure reproducibility and avoid dependency conflicts. This code repository helps me streamline my workflow by managing packages and environments efficiently.

# The Requirements

* `Offline Installation Support` : Allow package installations from local sources without requiring an internet connection, which is crucial when working in secure environments with limited internet access.
* `Lockfile Generation` : Provide a mechanism to freeze the current state of an environment into a lockfile for reproducibility, ensuring my experiments can be replicated.
* `Virtual Environment Management` : Allow creation and management of isolated environments for package installations, ensuring no global conflicts with other projects.
* `Package Existence Check` : Implement a function to check if a specific package is installed in the current environment, helping me verify dependencies before running my scripts.
* `Package Update Notifications` : Notify users when newer versions of installed packages are available, so I can keep my tools up-to-date.
* `Environment Export` : Allow exporting of an environment's configuration for sharing or backup purposes, making collaboration with colleagues easier.
* `Dependency Constraint Solver` : Automatically resolve and install the latest compatible versions of packages and their dependencies based on specified constraints, saving me from manual dependency management.
* `Security Vulnerability Alerts` : Notify users of known security vulnerabilities in installed packages, ensuring the security of my projects.
* `Environment Import` : Enable importing of environment configurations to quickly set up predefined environments, speeding up the onboarding process for new team members.
* `Dependency Explanation` : Add a feature to explain why a package was installed, detailing its dependency chain, which helps me understand the underlying dependencies of my projects.
