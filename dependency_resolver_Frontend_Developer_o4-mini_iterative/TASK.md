# The Task

I am a frontend developer. I want to manage my project's dependencies efficiently and ensure that my development environment is consistent with my team's setups. This code repository helps me maintain package versions and provides a user-friendly interface for managing dependencies.

# The Requirements

* `GUI Management Tool` : Create a graphical user interface for users who prefer managing packages through visual interaction.
* `Package Version Pinning` : Allow users to pin specific package versions to prevent unintended updates.
* `Package Search` : Implement a search API to find packages by name and version specifications in the registry.
* `Package Metadata Display` : Provide detailed information about packages, including version history and dependencies.
