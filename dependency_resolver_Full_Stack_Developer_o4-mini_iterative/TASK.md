# The Task

I am a full-stack developer responsible for maintaining and deploying web applications. I want to manage my development environments efficiently to ensure that my applications run smoothly across different stages of development and production. This code repository provides the necessary tools to handle package management and environment configurations effectively.

# The Requirements

* `Environment Deletion` : I need to delete outdated environments to keep my development workspace clean.
* `Install from Lockfile` : I want to ensure that my development and production environments are identical by installing from a lockfile.
* `Lockfile Generation` : I need to generate lockfiles to capture the exact state of my environments for consistent deployments.
* `Security Vulnerability Alerts` : I require alerts for any security vulnerabilities in my packages to protect my applications.
* `Package Removal` : I need to remove unused packages safely without affecting other dependencies.
* `GUI Management Tool` : I prefer using a graphical interface to manage packages visually for better clarity.
* `Environment Switching` : I want to switch between development, testing, and production environments with ease.
* `Cross-Platform Compatibility` : I work on both macOS and Linux, so the package manager must be compatible with these systems.
* `Rollback Functionality` : I need the ability to rollback to a previous environment state in case something goes wrong during updates.
