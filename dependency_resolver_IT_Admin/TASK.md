# The Task

I am an IT administrator responsible for managing the software environments of a large team of developers and data scientists. I want to be able to set up, maintain, and troubleshoot these environments efficiently. This code repository provides the tools I need to ensure that everyone has the right tools and configurations for their work.

# The Requirements

* `Environment Import` : Enable importing of environment configurations to quickly set up predefined environments for team members.
* `Environment Deletion` : Provide a command to delete environments that are no longer needed, helping manage system resources effectively.
* `Custom Repository Support` : Enable me to add and manage custom package repositories, ensuring that team members have access to necessary libraries.
* `Conflict Detection` : Automatically detect and alert me of version conflicts during package installations, aiding in troubleshooting.
* `Dependency Constraint Solver` : Automatically resolve and install the latest compatible versions of packages and their dependencies based on specified constraints, ensuring smooth operation of environments.
* `User-Friendly CLI` : Develop a command-line interface that is intuitive and easy to use for managing packages and environments, making it easier to support the team.
* `Offline Installation Support` : Allow package installations from local sources without requiring an internet connection, essential for secure environments.
