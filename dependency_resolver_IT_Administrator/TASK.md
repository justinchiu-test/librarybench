# The Task

I am an IT administrator responsible for managing software installations and updates across a large organization. I want to ensure that all systems are running the correct software versions and are free from vulnerabilities. This code repository provides the tools I need to manage software environments efficiently and securely.

# The Requirements

* `Environment Deletion` : I need to remove unnecessary environments to optimize system resources.
* `Install from Lockfile` : I want to deploy consistent software environments across multiple systems using lockfiles.
* `Lockfile Generation` : I need to generate lockfiles to document the software state for compliance and auditing purposes.
* `Security Vulnerability Alerts` : I require alerts for any security vulnerabilities to ensure all systems are protected.
* `Package Removal` : I need to remove software packages safely without disrupting other applications.
* `Environment Switching` : I want to switch between different software configurations smoothly for maintenance tasks.
* `Cross-Platform Compatibility` : I manage systems running Windows, macOS, and Linux, so the package manager must be cross-platform.
* `Rollback Functionality` : I need the ability to rollback software updates if they cause issues on any system.
* `Package Version Pinning` : I want to pin specific software versions to prevent unauthorized updates.
