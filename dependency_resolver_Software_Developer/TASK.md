# The Task

I am a software developer who frequently works on applications that have complex dependency requirements. I want to be able to manage these dependencies efficiently, avoid conflicts, and ensure that my applications run smoothly across different environments. This code repository provides the necessary tools to streamline my development process.

# The Requirements

* `Environment Import` : Enable importing of environment configurations to quickly set up predefined environments for my applications.
* `Environment Deletion` : Provide a command to delete environments that are no longer needed, keeping my development workspace organized.
* `Custom Repository Support` : Enable me to add and manage custom package repositories, allowing access to specialized libraries.
* `Dependency Constraint Solver` : Automatically resolve and install the latest compatible versions of packages and their dependencies based on specified constraints, ensuring my applications run smoothly.
* `Package Version Pinning` : Allow me to pin specific package versions to prevent unintended updates, maintaining application stability.
* `User-Friendly CLI` : Develop a command-line interface that is intuitive and easy to use for managing packages and environments, so I can focus on coding.
* `Offline Installation Support` : Allow package installations from local sources without requiring an internet connection, useful when working in restricted network environments.
