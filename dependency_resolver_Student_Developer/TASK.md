# The Task

I am a Student Developer. I want to learn how to manage software dependencies effectively while working on my projects. This code repository will provide me with the tools to understand and control the packages I use, aiding my learning process.

# The Requirements

* `cross_platform_compatibility` : Ensure the package manager works seamlessly across different operating systems.
* `package_metadata_display` : Provide detailed information about packages, including version history and dependencies.
* `gui_management_tool` : Create a graphical user interface for users who prefer managing packages through visual interaction.
* `dependency_explanation` : Add a feature to explain why a package was installed, detailing its dependency chain.
* `package_existence_check` : Implement a function to check if a specific package is installed in the current environment.
