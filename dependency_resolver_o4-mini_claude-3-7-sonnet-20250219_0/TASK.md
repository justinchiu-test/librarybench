# The Task

Create a lightweight package manager that can install, remove, and query software packages with dependencies.

# Requirements:

Be able to add packages, including all of its recursive dependencies. We should also be able to remove packages by name, only if it's not a dependency of anything else. Also provide functionality to list all currently installed packages and check if a package is installed.
