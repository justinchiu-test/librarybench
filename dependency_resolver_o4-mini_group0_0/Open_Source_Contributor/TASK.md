# The Task

I am an open-source contributor working on various community-driven projects. I want to ensure that my contributions are compatible with the project's existing dependencies and that I can easily manage different environments for different projects. This code repository provides the necessary tools to manage dependencies and environments efficiently.

# The Requirements

* `Offline Installation Support` : Allow package installations from local sources without requiring an internet connection, which is useful when working in environments with limited connectivity.
* `Lockfile Generation` : Provide a mechanism to freeze the current state of an environment into a lockfile for reproducibility, ensuring my contributions work as expected across different setups.
* `Virtual Environment Management` : Allow creation and management of isolated environments for package installations, preventing conflicts between different projects.
* `Package Existence Check` : Implement a function to check if a specific package is installed in the current environment, helping me verify dependencies before submitting code.
* `Package Update Notifications` : Notify users when newer versions of installed packages are available, so I can keep my contributions up-to-date with the latest improvements.
* `Environment Export` : Allow exporting of an environment's configuration for sharing or backup purposes, making it easier to share my development setup with other contributors.
* `Dependency Constraint Solver` : Automatically resolve and install the latest compatible versions of packages and their dependencies based on specified constraints, simplifying the setup process for new contributors.
* `Security Vulnerability Alerts` : Notify users of known security vulnerabilities in installed packages, ensuring the security of the projects I contribute to.
* `Environment Import` : Enable importing of environment configurations to quickly set up predefined environments, facilitating collaboration with other contributors.
* `Dependency Explanation` : Add a feature to explain why a package was installed, detailing its dependency chain, which helps in understanding the project's dependency structure.
