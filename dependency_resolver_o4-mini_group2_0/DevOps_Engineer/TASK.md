# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and deployment pipelines for our software applications. I want to ensure that our environments are consistent across development, testing, and production stages. This code repository provides the tools necessary to manage and automate environment setups effectively.

# The Requirements

* `Offline Installation Support` : Allow package installations from local sources without requiring an internet connection, which is essential for deploying applications in isolated network environments.
* `Lockfile Generation` : Provide a mechanism to freeze the current state of an environment into a lockfile for reproducibility, ensuring consistent deployments across different stages.
* `Virtual Environment Management` : Allow creation and management of isolated environments for package installations, preventing conflicts between different applications on the same server.
* `Package Existence Check` : Implement a function to check if a specific package is installed in the current environment, aiding in troubleshooting deployment issues.
* `Package Update Notifications` : Notify users when newer versions of installed packages are available, so I can plan updates and patches accordingly.
* `Environment Export` : Allow exporting of an environment's configuration for sharing or backup purposes, facilitating disaster recovery and environment replication.
* `Dependency Constraint Solver` : Automatically resolve and install the latest compatible versions of packages and their dependencies based on specified constraints, ensuring smooth deployment processes.
* `Security Vulnerability Alerts` : Notify users of known security vulnerabilities in installed packages, helping maintain the security posture of our applications.
* `Environment Import` : Enable importing of environment configurations to quickly set up predefined environments, streamlining the deployment process.
* `Dependency Explanation` : Add a feature to explain why a package was installed, detailing its dependency chain, which assists in auditing and compliance checks.
