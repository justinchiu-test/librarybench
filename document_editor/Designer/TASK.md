# The Task

I am a designer. I want to be able to collaborate on design documents, manage versions, and ensure that my work aligns with the project goals. This code repository allows me to edit, track, and manage design assets efficiently.

# The Requirements

* `unlock_section`: Unlock design documents for editing when updates are needed.
* `collaborator_list`: Manage access to design documents for collaboration with other team members.
* `history_view`: View the history of design changes to understand the evolution of the project.
* `apply_operation`: Simulate design changes to see their impact before finalizing.
* `resolve_conflict`: Resolve conflicts when multiple designers work on the same document.
* `template_support`: Use design templates to maintain consistency across different projects.
* `branch`: Create branches for different design concepts or iterations.
* `redo`: Reapply design changes that were undone by mistake.
* `checkout`: Revert to previous design versions if needed.
* `edit`: Update design documents to reflect new ideas or feedback.
