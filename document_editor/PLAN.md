# Implementation Plan for Document Editor

## High-Level Architecture
- Create a Document class to represent a document with version control functionality
- Design a commit graph (Directed Acyclic Graph) to track document history
- Implement branch management for parallel editing workflows
- Build merge functionality to combine changes from different branches

## Data Structures
1. **Document**: Main class with document metadata and reference to current state
2. **Commit**: Represents a snapshot of document state with metadata
3. **Branch**: Maintains separate development lines with their own commits
4. **KeyValueStore**: Core data structure to represent document content

## Implementation Steps

1. **Core Document Class Implementation**
   - Set up document initialization
   - Design key-value store for document content
   - Implement tracking of current state

2. **Version Control Basics**
   - Implement commit functionality to save snapshots
   - Create log function to display commit history
   - Build checkout to restore previous document states

3. **Branch Management**
   - Add branch creation functionality
   - Implement branch switching
   - Track branch references to commits

4. **Merge Functionality**
   - Create basic merge algorithm for combining branches
   - Handle conflict resolution (basic implementation)

5. **Testing**
   - Test document creation and editing
   - Verify versioning functionality
   - Test branching and merging scenarios

## API Implementation Details

1. **create_document(name: str)**
   - Initialize a new Document object with the given name
   - Create initial empty state
   - Set up default branch ("main")

2. **edit(doc: str, key: str, value: str)**
   - Find document by name
   - Update the key-value pair in current state
   - Mark document as having uncommitted changes

3. **commit(doc: str, message: str)**
   - Create a new Commit object with current state
   - Set commit message and metadata
   - Add to commit history and update current branch reference

4. **log(doc: str)**
   - Return formatted history of commits
   - Include commit IDs, messages, timestamps

5. **checkout(doc: str, commit_id: str)**
   - Find commit by ID
   - Restore document state to that commit's snapshot
   - Update current reference

6. **branch(doc: str, branch_name: str)**
   - Create new branch at current commit
   - Set up branch tracking

7. **merge(doc: str, source_branch: str, dest_branch: str)**
   - Find common ancestor of branches
   - Apply changes from source to destination
   - Create merge commit

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each core function
- Integration tests for workflows combining multiple operations
- Edge case testing for unusual sequences of operations
