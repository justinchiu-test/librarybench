# The Task

I am a research scientist. I want to manage and document my research findings and data analysis efficiently. This code repository helps me keep track of different versions of my research papers and collaborate with co-authors.

# The Requirements

* `template_support`: Create and apply templates for document sections to ensure all research papers follow a standard format.
* `branch`: Fork the current state of a document into a new branch with a specified name to explore different hypotheses or approaches without altering the main document.
* `log`: Return the commit history of a document to track the progression of research and revisions.
* `import`: Import content from external files into the document to include data analysis results and external references.
* `snapshot`: Tag a specific version of a document with a human-readable label to denote submission-ready drafts or significant research milestones.
* `merge`: Naively merge changes from a source branch into a destination branch to integrate contributions from different team members.
* `checkout`: Revert a document to a previous commit using a commit ID or label to recover from errors or revert to a previous analysis.
* `collaborator_list`: Manage a list of collaborators with access to the document to coordinate with co-authors and research assistants.
* `lock_section`: Lock a section of the document to prevent edits once a section has been finalized for publication.
* `commit`: Commit the current state of the document with a descriptive message to record the rationale behind changes and updates.
