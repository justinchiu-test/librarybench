# The Task

I am a content manager. I want to organize and maintain a large library of digital content efficiently. This code repository enables me to version control content, manage team collaboration, and ensure content quality.

# The Requirements

* `template_support`: Create and apply templates for document sections to maintain a consistent look and feel across all content pieces.
* `branch`: Fork the current state of a document into a new branch with a specified name to develop new content ideas without disrupting existing content.
* `log`: Return the commit history of a document to monitor changes and ensure accountability.
* `import`: Import content from external files into the document to consolidate information from various sources.
* `snapshot`: Tag a specific version of a document with a human-readable label to mark completed content pieces ready for publication.
* `merge`: Naively merge changes from a source branch into a destination branch to integrate updates and edits from different team members.
* `checkout`: Revert a document to a previous commit using a commit ID or label to restore previous content versions if needed.
* `collaborator_list`: Manage a list of collaborators with access to the document to coordinate with writers, editors, and designers.
* `lock_section`: Lock a section of the document to prevent edits and protect finalized content from unauthorized changes.
* `commit`: Commit the current state of the document with a descriptive message to document the purpose and details of changes.
