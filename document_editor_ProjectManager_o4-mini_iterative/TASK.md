# The Task

I am a Project Manager. I want to ensure that all project documentation is up-to-date and that my team is aware of any changes. This code repository helps me oversee document revisions, manage team access, and maintain clear communication.

# The Requirements

* `resolve_conflict` : Resolve merge conflicts by specifying a resolved value for a key, ensuring consistency in project documents.
* `collaborator_list` : Manage a list of collaborators with access to the document, granting the right team members the ability to edit.
* `activity_feed` : Display a real-time feed of activities and changes in the document, allowing me to monitor progress.
* `comment` : Add comments to specific sections of the document to provide feedback or request changes.
* `unlock_section` : Unlock a previously locked section for editing when updates are required.
* `snapshot` : Tag a specific version of a document with a human-readable label to easily reference project milestones.
* `version_compare` : Compare and highlight differences between two document versions to review changes before approval.
* `notifications` : Notify users of changes or updates to the document, ensuring that the team is always informed.
* `apply_operation` : Queue operations (insert/delete/edit) to simulate real-time user edits, enabling efficient collaboration.
* `log` : Return the commit history of a document to review all changes and decisions made.
