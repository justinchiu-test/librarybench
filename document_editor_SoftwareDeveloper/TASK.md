# The Task

I am a software developer. I want to be able to manage code changes, collaborate with my team, and ensure the integrity of our project. This code repository provides tools for version control, conflict resolution, and collaborative editing.

# The Requirements

* `unlock_section`: Unlock code sections for editing when implementing new features or fixing bugs.
* `collaborator_list`: Manage team access to ensure the right people can contribute to the codebase.
* `history_view`: Review the history of changes to understand the development process and identify issues.
* `apply_operation`: Simulate code changes to test their impact before committing.
* `resolve_conflict`: Resolve merge conflicts that arise during collaborative development.
* `template_support`: Use code templates to maintain consistency and speed up development.
* `branch`: Create branches for new features or experimental changes without affecting the main codebase.
* `redo`: Reapply changes that were undone to avoid losing important work.
* `checkout`: Revert to stable versions of the code when necessary.
* `edit`: Update code efficiently to implement new features or fix bugs.
