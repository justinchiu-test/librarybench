# The Task

I am a technical writer. I want to be able to manage and version control my documentation projects efficiently. This code repository allows me to collaborate with other writers, track changes, and ensure consistency across all documents.

# The Requirements

* `template_support`: Create and apply templates for document sections to maintain consistency in style and formatting.
* `branch`: Fork the current state of a document into a new branch with a specified name to experiment with different content structures without affecting the main document.
* `log`: Return the commit history of a document to review changes and understand the evolution of the content.
* `import`: Import content from external files into the document to integrate information from various sources seamlessly.
* `snapshot`: Tag a specific version of a document with a human-readable label to mark milestones or completed drafts.
* `merge`: Naively merge changes from a source branch into a destination branch to consolidate edits from multiple collaborators.
* `checkout`: Revert a document to a previous commit using a commit ID or label to undo changes or restore a previous version.
* `collaborator_list`: Manage a list of collaborators with access to the document to facilitate teamwork and assign roles.
* `lock_section`: Lock a section of the document to prevent edits and maintain the integrity of finalized sections.
* `commit`: Commit the current state of the document with a descriptive message to document the purpose of changes and updates.
