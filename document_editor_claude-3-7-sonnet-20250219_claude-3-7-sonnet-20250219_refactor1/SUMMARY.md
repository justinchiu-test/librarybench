# Document Editor Implementation Summary

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Document Editor Core Classes**
   - Created `Document` class to represent a document with version control
   - Implemented `Commit` class for tracking document history
   - Added `Operation`, `Conflict`, and other supporting data structures

2. **Version Control Functionality**
   - Document creation with `create_document()`
   - Content editing with `edit()`
   - Committing changes with `commit()`
   - Viewing history with `log()`
   - Checking out previous versions with `checkout()`

3. **Branching and Merging**
   - Branch creation with `branch()`
   - Branch merging with `merge()` with conflict detection
   - Conflict resolution with `resolve_conflict()`

4. **Real-time Operation Queueing**
   - Operation queueing with `apply_operation()`
   - Synchronization with `sync()`
   - Support for insert, edit, and delete operations

5. **Snapshots and Labeled Versions**
   - Creating snapshots with `snapshot()`
   - Checkout by label or commit ID

6. **Autosave Functionality**
   - Automatic saving with configurable intervals
   - Enable/disable with `enable_autosave()` and `disable_autosave()`

## Data Structures

- Used a key-value store approach for document content
- Implemented a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for the commit history
- Used branch references to track different development paths
- Added operation queue for real-time editing
- Implemented conflict tracking and resolution
- Added snapshot labels for human-readable versioning

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite in `test.py`
- Covered all key functionality including document creation, editing, and advanced features
- Built specialized tests for conflict detection and resolution
- Added tests for operation queueing, snapshots, and autosave

## Example Usage

- Created `example.py` to demonstrate the core library's functionality
- Added `example_v2.py` for advanced features
- Shows complete workflows including conflict resolution, snapshots, and real-time operations

## Key Features Added in V2

1. **Real-time Operation Queueing**
   - Operations can be queued and applied later
   - Maintains ordering by timestamps
   - Supports insert, edit, and delete operations

2. **Enhanced Conflict Resolution**
   - Detects conflicts during merge operations
   - Allows manual resolution of conflicts
   - Preserves history of conflict resolution

3. **Snapshots and Labeled Versions**
   - Human-readable labels for important versions
   - Easy checkout by label instead of commit ID

4. **Autosave Functionality**
   - Configurable autosave intervals
   - Background saving without disrupting user operations

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Merge Algorithms**
   - Implement three-way merge for better conflict resolution
   - Support for partial merging of specific sections

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - For large documents, implement partial snapshots
   - Optimized storage for operation history

3. **Additional Features**
   - Diff viewing between commits
   - Revert specific changes
   - Support for more complex collaboration patterns
   - Real-time collaboration with operational transforms

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully meets all the requirements specified in the task. It provides a simple but complete document editing system with version control, branching, and merging capabilities while maintaining a clean separation of concerns in the code architecture.
