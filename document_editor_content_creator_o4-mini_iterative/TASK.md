# The Task

I am a content creator managing a large repository of multimedia content for various platforms. I want to be able to organize, update, and track different versions of my content, ensuring consistency and quality across all platforms. This code repository helps me manage content versions and collaborate with my team effectively.

# The Requirements

* `checkout`: Revert to previous versions of content to restore or compare different iterations.
* `branch`: Create branches for different content themes or campaigns, allowing targeted updates and releases.
* `commit`: Save changes to content with descriptive messages to maintain a clear history of updates.
* `edit`: Update specific sections of content as needed for different platforms or audiences.
* `revert`: Undo recent changes if they do not meet quality standards or require further revision.
* `comment`: Add comments to content sections to note ideas, feedback, or areas for improvement.
* `search`: Locate specific content pieces or themes quickly within the repository.
* `snapshot`: Tag specific versions of content for particular campaigns or releases.
* `merge`: Combine updates from different branches to ensure all necessary content is included in the final product.
* `diff`: Compare different content versions to identify changes and ensure consistency.
