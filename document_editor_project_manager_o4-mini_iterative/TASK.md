# The Task

I am a project manager. I want to be able to oversee the documentation process and ensure that all project specifications are up-to-date and accessible to the team. This code repository helps me track progress and manage changes efficiently.

# The Requirements

* `autosave`: Ensure that all edits are automatically saved, so no information is lost during updates.
* `commit`: Allow me to commit changes with clear messages, making it easy to understand what was updated and why.
* `activity_feed`: Provide a real-time feed of all activities and changes, so I can monitor the team's progress and contributions.
* `version_compare`: Enable me to compare different versions of a document to verify updates and ensure accuracy.
* `resolve_conflict`: Help me resolve any merge conflicts that arise, ensuring that the final document is correct and complete.
* `flush_operations`: Apply all queued operations in the correct order to maintain the document's integrity.
* `edit`: Allow me to update specific sections of project documentation, such as timelines or deliverables, without affecting other content.
* `unlock_section`: Let me unlock sections that are locked for editing, so I can make necessary updates.
* `undo`: Provide the ability to revert the last operation if a mistake is made during editing.
* `template_support`: Allow me to create and apply templates for documentation sections, ensuring consistency across all project documents.
