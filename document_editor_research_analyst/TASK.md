# The Task

I am a research analyst. I want to document my findings and collaborate with my team to ensure that all research data is accurately recorded and accessible. This code repository helps me manage document versions, control access, and facilitate collaboration.

# The Requirements

* `diff`: I need to track changes between document versions to see how research findings evolve.
* `autosave`: Autosaving ensures that my work is preserved even if I forget to save manually.
* `template_support`: Templates help me maintain consistency in documenting different research projects.
* `lock_section`: I lock sections that contain finalized data to prevent accidental changes.
* `unlock_section`: When new data is available, I can unlock sections to update the information.
* `search`: Searching within the document helps me quickly find specific data points.
* `permissions`: Managing permissions is crucial to control who can edit or view sensitive research data.
* `export`: Exporting documents to formats like PDF is necessary for sharing findings with external stakeholders.
* `collaborator_list`: Managing collaborators ensures that the right team members have access to the research documents.
* `branch`: I use branching to explore different research hypotheses without affecting the main document.
