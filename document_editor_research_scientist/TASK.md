# The Task

I am a research scientist working on a collaborative project with multiple datasets and analysis scripts. I want to be able to manage different versions of my analysis, collaborate with colleagues, and ensure reproducibility of results. This code repository allows me to track changes, manage different analysis branches, and collaborate efficiently with my research team.

# The Requirements

* `checkout`: Revert to previous versions of analysis scripts or datasets to verify results or explore alternative approaches.
* `branch`: Create branches for different analysis methods or hypotheses, allowing parallel exploration without interference.
* `commit`: Save changes to scripts or datasets with detailed messages to document the research process.
* `edit`: Update specific sections of analysis scripts or datasets as new data or insights are obtained.
* `revert`: Undo recent changes if they lead to incorrect results or need further refinement.
* `comment`: Add comments to scripts or datasets to explain methodologies or note important observations.
* `search`: Quickly find specific data points or script sections relevant to the research.
* `snapshot`: Tag specific versions of analysis scripts or datasets that correspond to published results or significant findings.
* `merge`: Integrate changes from different branches to consolidate findings or methodologies.
* `diff`: Compare different versions of scripts or datasets to understand changes and their impact on results.
