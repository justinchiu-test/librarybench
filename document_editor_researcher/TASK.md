# The Task

I am a researcher compiling a comprehensive report based on multiple studies. I want to be able to organize my findings, collaborate with co-authors, and ensure that all changes are tracked and reversible. This code repository helps me manage my document effectively while maintaining a high level of accuracy and organization.

# The Requirements

* `export`: Export the document to formats like PDF or DOCX for submission to journals or conferences.
* `template_support`: Apply templates to structure different sections of the report consistently.
* `version_compare`: Compare and highlight differences between document versions to track revisions and updates.
* `checkout`: Revert a document to a previous commit using a commit ID or label if necessary.
* `notifications`: Notify co-authors of changes or updates to the document to facilitate collaboration.
* `branch`: Fork the current state of a document into a new branch for exploring alternative analyses or interpretations.
* `revert`: Revert changes made since the last commit to maintain the document's integrity.
* `autosave`: Simulate a background process that periodically autosaves edits every N operations to prevent data loss.
* `undo`: Revert the last operation performed on the document to quickly correct mistakes.
* `permissions`: Manage user permissions to control who can edit or view the document, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
