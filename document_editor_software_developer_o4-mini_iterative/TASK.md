# The Task

I am a software developer. I want to be able to manage code documentation and collaborate with my team on project specifications. This code repository allows me to keep everything organized and up-to-date.

# The Requirements

* `autosave`: Periodically autosave my edits to ensure that no work is lost during long coding sessions.
* `commit`: Enable me to commit changes with detailed messages, so I can track the development progress and document updates.
* `activity_feed`: Show a real-time feed of all activities, helping me stay informed about what my team members are working on.
* `version_compare`: Allow me to compare different versions of a document to review changes and ensure that all updates are correct.
* `resolve_conflict`: Assist me in resolving merge conflicts that occur when multiple developers are working on the same documentation.
* `flush_operations`: Apply all queued operations in the correct order to ensure that the document reflects the latest changes.
* `edit`: Let me update specific sections of the documentation, such as API references or code examples, without altering other parts.
* `unlock_section`: Allow me to unlock sections that are locked for editing, so I can make necessary changes.
* `undo`: Provide the ability to revert the last operation if an error is made during editing.
* `template_support`: Enable me to create and apply templates for documentation sections, ensuring consistency and saving time.
