# The Task

I am a technical writer. I want to be able to efficiently manage and update documentation for our software products. This code repository helps me maintain version control, track changes, and ensure consistency across all documents.

# The Requirements

* `autosave`: Automatically save my edits as I work through different sections of the documentation, so I don't lose any progress.
* `commit`: Allow me to commit changes with a descriptive message, making it easy to track what was updated and why.
* `activity_feed`: Provide a real-time feed of all activities and changes, so I can keep an eye on updates made by other team members.
* `version_compare`: Enable me to compare different versions of a document to see what changes were made and ensure accuracy.
* `resolve_conflict`: Help me resolve any merge conflicts that arise when multiple people are editing the same document.
* `flush_operations`: Ensure that all my queued edits are applied in the correct order to maintain document integrity.
* `edit`: Allow me to update specific sections of a document without affecting the rest of the content.
* `unlock_section`: Let me unlock sections that are currently locked for editing, so I can make necessary updates.
* `undo`: Give me the ability to revert the last operation if I make a mistake.
* `template_support`: Allow me to create and apply templates for document sections to maintain consistency and save time.
