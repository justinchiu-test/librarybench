# The Task

I am a Data Engineer. I want to build reliable ETL pipelines that can backfill, replay, and audit every event with context. This code repository ensures I can persist streams, rewind for reprocessing, and keep my tracing and metadata intact.

# The Requirements

* `reportHealth()`            : dashboards and endpoints reporting consumer lag, thread-pool usage, and handler counts  
* `balanceLoad()`             : distribute parsing and transformation jobs across a pool of worker threads  
* `propagateContext()`        : maintain lineage metadata, trace spans, and security tags through my data flows  
* `registerSerializer()`      : implement custom serializers for CSV, JSON, Parquet, or Protobuf payloads  
* `persistEvents()`           : store raw and processed events in a durable store with replay/rewind capabilities  
* `publishSync()`             : optionally process events synchronously for batch jobs and deterministic ordering  
* `updateConfig()`            : adjust backpressure thresholds, timeouts, and parallelism settings on the fly  
* `registerExtension()`       : drop-in new transforms or queue backends (e.g., Kafka, S3, HDFS) via plugin API  
* `authenticate()`            : secure my data streams with token-based ACLs or Kerberos principal checks  
* `handleErrors()`            : catch transform failures, auto-retry with incremental delays, and log dead-letter events
