# The Task

I am a Security Architect. I want to enforce strict access control, audit every message, and ensure our event infrastructure is tamper-resistant. This code repository offers authentication, context propagation, and secure extension points out of the box.

# The Requirements

* `reportHealth()`            : secure health endpoints that require ACLs for revealing thread pools, queues, and handlers  
* `balanceLoad()`             : thread-safe load balancing that prevents side-channel leaks and enforces tenant isolation  
* `propagateContext()`        : carry encryption keys, security tokens, and audit spans across sync/async boundaries  
* `registerSerializer()`      : support custom encrypted or signed serialization schemes for sensitive payloads  
* `persistEvents()`           : encrypted disk or database persistence with replay audits and tamper checks  
* `publishSync()`             : optional sync mode for high-assurance workflows requiring strict ordering  
* `updateConfig()`            : tighten or loosen backpressure, timeouts, and filters at runtime via a secure API  
* `registerExtension()`       : safely load vetted plugins for custom crypto modules or compliance checks  
* `authenticate()`            : enforce OAuth2/JWT or mTLS-based ACLs on every publish and subscribe call  
* `handleErrors()`            : log exceptions, perform secure retries with jitter, and quarantine unprocessable events
