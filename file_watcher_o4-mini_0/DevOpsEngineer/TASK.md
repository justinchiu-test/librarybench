# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer responsible for keeping our deployments in sync with on-disk changes. I want to be able to watch critical configuration repositories and application artifacts in real time, simulate deployments safely, and drive Jenkins or GitHub Actions pipelines automatically when files change. This code repository gives me a unified, resilient, and customizable file-watching toolkit to integrate directly into our CI/CD workflows.

# The Requirements

* `cli_interface` : Provide a command-line mode to start watchers and see events as they happen in my terminal.  
* `dry_run_mode` : Offer a “simulation” mode so I can validate watch patterns and pipeline triggers without actually firing jobs.  
* `event_history_store` : Maintain an in-memory or on-disk log of past file events, with querying and rollover when logs grow too large.  
* `symlink_config` : Configure how watchers handle symlinked deployment directories—follow them, ignore them, or treat them specially.  
* `resilient_error_handling` : Implement retry logic with exponential backoff and callbacks for transient filesystem or permission failures on my network mounts.  
* `cicd_plugins` : Ship built-in integrations for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI so I can fire builds or step workflows on selected FS events.  
* `handler_registration` : Register callbacks per event type or path pattern (e.g., deploy only when files under `/configs/` change).  
* `hidden_file_filter` : Toggle ignoring system and dot-files so I don’t trigger deploys on editor swap files.  
* `async_io_api` : Provide a fully asynchronous interface for non-blocking file polling inside our Python-based orchestration scripts.  
* `throttling_control` : Rate-limit event emission to prevent flooding our CI master under heavy commit bursts.
