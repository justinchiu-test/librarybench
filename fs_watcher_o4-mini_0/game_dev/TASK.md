# The Task

I am a game developer iterating on assets (textures, scripts, audio) in real time. I want a file watcher that reloads changed assets on the fly, batches updates during big asset imports, and gracefully handles hundreds of files without blocking my editor. This code repository gives me a low-latency, configurable watching layer.

# The Requirements

* `configure_thread_pool(worker_count)` : Maintain a pool of threads so live‐reload handlers process quickly and in parallel.
* `set_filters(include=['assets/**/*.png','assets/**/*.wav'], exclude=['**/*.psd.tmp'])` : Only watch build‐ready assets, ignore tmp or backup files.
* `set_throttle(max_events=50, per_ms=1000)` : Throttle file change events during large texture imports.
* `on_event(reload_callback)` : Typed events for created, modified, deleted, moved with timestamps and full paths.
* `batch_dispatch(batch_time_ms=200)` : Batch rapid change events into frames to avoid flooding the game engine.
* `configure_logging(logging.DEBUG)` : Use debug/info/warning logs to diagnose live‐reload issues.
* `set_polling_strategy(custom_fs_scanner)` : Hook in a platform‐optimized polling scan for consoles or remote asset servers.
* `apply_rate_limit('asset_loader', 30)` : Cap event delivery to the asset pipeline to maintain stable frame rates.
* `run_single_scan('assets/')` : One‐off directory crawl for initial asset inventory or sanity checks.
* `__enter__` / `__exit__` Context Manager API : Automatically start/stop the watcher inside our editor plugin.
