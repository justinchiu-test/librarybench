# The Task

I am a research scientist collecting high‐frequency sensor data dumps in a shared directory. I want to detect and batch‐process new measurement files, while ignoring calibration or temp files, and ensure my pipeline doesn’t get overwhelmed during experiments. This code repository lets me build a robust file listener for my analysis scripts.

# The Requirements

* `configure_thread_pool(num_workers)` : Spread processing of sensor data files across multiple threads for speed.
* `set_filters(include=['data/**/*.csv'], exclude=['data/**/calibration_*','*.tmp'])` : Only pick up real measurement files.
* `set_throttle(max_events=20, per_ms=1000)` : Control the flood of events during rapid‐fire data dumps.
* `on_event(process_data_callback)` : Receive typed events for file creation, modification, deletion, and moves, complete with metadata.
* `batch_dispatch(interval_ms=300)` : Bundle file events into batches, so my analysis pipeline can work on chunks efficiently.
* `configure_logging('INFO')` : Log backpressure, errors, and debug messages using Python’s logging module.
* `set_polling_strategy(custom_scanner)` : Swap in a lab‐optimized polling strategy to handle networked storage quirks.
* `apply_rate_limit('analysis_worker', 10)` : Limit how many batches my worker consumes per second to avoid memory spikes.
* `run_single_scan('data/')` : Manually scan the folder for any files I missed overnight.
* `with fs_watcher.Watcher(...) as watcher:` : Use a context manager for automatic setup and teardown in my Jupyter notebooks or scripts.
