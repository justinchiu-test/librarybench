# The Task

I am a DevOps reliability engineer. I want to be able to test our microservicesâ€™ resilience by simulating network failures, timeouts, malformed payloads, and CORS misconfigurations. This code repository empowers me to introduce chaos into HTTP and WebSocket traffic in a controlled, repeatable way.

# The Requirements

* `startRequestRecording` : Track all inter-service calls for post-mortem analysis.  
* `httpClient.get/post/put/delete` : Fault-injection-aware client with metrics hooks.  
* `simulateError` : Randomize 5xx, connection resets, latencies or broken payloads.  
* `assertHeader` : Detect missing tracing or correlation headers to ensure observability.  
* `registerEndpoint` : Temporarily hijack service routes or wildcard patterns.  
* `configureCORS` : Inject CORS faults to validate front-door gateways.  
* `mockWebSocket` : Create flaky WS servers with dropped frames or malformed JSON.  
* `setRetryPolicy` : Stress-test backoff strategies under load.  
* `addDynamicCallback` : Script progressive delays, partial responses or token rotations.  
* `assertRequestBody` : Catch malformed or unexpected payloads before they reach real services.
