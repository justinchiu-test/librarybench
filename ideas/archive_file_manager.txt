# Archive File Manager

## Requester Identity
A data archivist working with legacy systems who frequently needs to create, extract, and manipulate various archive formats. They require a unified tool that can handle multiple compression formats and provide advanced features like selective extraction and archive conversion.

## Project Title
PyArchiver - Multi-format Archive Management and Compression Tool

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyArchiver is a comprehensive archive management tool supporting multiple compression formats (ZIP, TAR, custom formats) with advanced features like incremental archiving, encryption, and multi-volume archives. It provides both command-line and programmatic interfaces for creating, extracting, and manipulating archives while maintaining compatibility with standard formats.

## Key Features
1. Multi-format support with pluggable compression algorithms
2. Incremental and differential archive creation
3. Archive content search and selective extraction
4. Encryption and password protection capabilities
5. Multi-volume archive splitting and joining

## Implementation with Standard Library
The tool uses `zipfile` and `tarfile` for standard formats, `zlib`, `bz2`, and `lzma` for compression algorithms, `struct` for custom format headers, `os` and `pathlib` for file operations, `hashlib` for integrity checking, `hmac` for authentication, `secrets` for encryption key generation, `mmap` for efficient large file handling, `tempfile` for safe extraction, and `concurrent.futures` for parallel compression. Custom compression formats use byte-level manipulation.

## Target Users
System administrators, data archivists, backup specialists, software distributors, and developers working with compressed data formats.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project demonstrates strategy pattern for compression algorithms, adapter pattern for format compatibility, decorator pattern for encryption layers, streaming algorithms for large files, memory-efficient processing techniques, and file format specifications.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Cloud storage integration for remote archives
2. Archive content indexing for fast searches
3. Damaged archive recovery tools
4. Archive format conversion utilities
5. Compression ratio optimization algorithms
6. Archive content deduplication
7. Version control for archived files
8. Archive mounting as virtual filesystem
9. Batch processing with scripting support
10. Archive content preview without extraction
