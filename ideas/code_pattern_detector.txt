# Code Pattern Detector

## Requester Identity
A technical lead responsible for maintaining code quality standards across a large development team. They need automated tools to detect anti-patterns, security vulnerabilities, and coding standard violations to ensure consistent code quality during code reviews.

## Project Title
PyPatternGuard - Automated Code Pattern Detection and Analysis Engine

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyPatternGuard scans Python codebases to identify design patterns, anti-patterns, and potential code smells using abstract syntax tree analysis. It provides detailed reports on code quality issues, suggests refactoring opportunities, and helps enforce coding standards through customizable rule sets and pattern definitions.

## Key Features
1. AST-based pattern matching with custom rule definitions
2. Detection of common anti-patterns and code smells
3. Security vulnerability scanning for common issues
4. Customizable coding standard enforcement
5. Incremental analysis for large codebases with caching

## Implementation with Standard Library
The engine uses `ast` module for parsing and analyzing Python code, `re` for pattern matching in string literals and comments, `tokenize` for lexical analysis, `inspect` for runtime code inspection, `collections` for pattern statistics, `difflib` for code similarity detection, `json` for rule configuration, `sqlite3` for caching analysis results, `concurrent.futures` for parallel file processing, and `html` for generating interactive reports. Pattern matching algorithms are implemented using visitor patterns.

## Target Users
Technical leads, code reviewers, security teams, quality assurance engineers, and development teams wanting to maintain high code quality standards.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project showcases visitor pattern for AST traversal, composite pattern for complex rules, interpreter pattern for rule language, memoization for performance, static code analysis techniques, and pattern matching algorithms.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Machine learning-based pattern discovery
2. IDE plugin for real-time pattern detection
3. Git hook integration for pre-commit checks
4. Support for multiple programming languages
5. Automatic refactoring suggestions with code generation
6. Team-specific pattern libraries
7. Historical trend analysis of code quality
8. Integration with code review tools
9. Custom DSL for pattern definition
10. Performance impact analysis of detected patterns
