# Command-line Task Manager

## Requester Identity
A productivity-focused software developer who frequently works across multiple projects and prefers keyboard-driven interfaces for maximum efficiency. They value having their task management integrated directly into their terminal workflow without context switching.

## Project Title
TermTask - A Terminal-Based Task Management System

## Core Functionality and Purpose
TermTask is a comprehensive, terminal-based task management system that enables developers and power users to organize, track, and prioritize tasks directly from the command line. It provides a keyboard-driven interface with powerful search, filtering, and reporting capabilities to help users maintain productivity without leaving their terminal environment.

## Key Features
1. Hierarchical task organization with projects, tags, due dates, and priority levels
2. Powerful search and filtering using natural language queries
3. Customizable views (Kanban, list, calendar) rendered in ASCII/Unicode art
4. Time tracking and productivity analytics with exportable reports
5. Context-aware task suggestions based on recent activity patterns

## Implementation with Standard Library
This project can be implemented using primarily Python's standard library: `argparse` for command-line argument parsing, `sqlite3` for local database storage, `json` for data serialization, `datetime` for time management, `curses` for the terminal user interface, `re` for regex pattern matching in search, `collections` for efficient data structures, `concurrent.futures` for background operations, and `csv` for report exports. The `textwrap` and `shutil` modules help with terminal display formatting.

## Target Users
Software developers, system administrators, technical project managers, and command-line enthusiasts who prefer keyboard-driven interfaces integrated into their existing terminal workflow.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project demonstrates command pattern for operations, observer pattern for notifications, repository pattern for data access, strategy pattern for different view renderings, and decorator pattern for task attributes. It also showcases effective handling of persistent data, state management, event-driven programming, and text-based user interface design.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Git integration to associate tasks with code changes and branches
2. Synchronization with popular services like GitHub Issues or Jira
3. Pomodoro timer integration with notifications
4. Natural language processing for task entry and parsing
5. Team collaboration features with shared task lists
6. Terminal notifications for due dates and reminders
7. Email integration for creating tasks from messages
8. Advanced recurring task patterns with custom schedules
9. Dependencies and blockers between tasks with visualization
10. Customizable automation rules and triggers based on task properties
