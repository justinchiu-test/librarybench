## Project Title
PyCMS - A Lightweight Python Content Management System

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyCMS is a lightweight content management system that provides an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and organizing web content without requiring extensive technical knowledge. The system includes a simple web server, content editor, template system, and user management, all implemented using Python's standard library for maximum portability and minimal dependencies.

## Key Features
1. Markdown-based content editor with preview and version history
2. Template system for consistent site appearance with customizable themes
3. User authentication and permission system for content management
4. Media library for uploading and organizing images and documents
5. RESTful API for headless CMS functionality and integration with other systems

## Implementation with Standard Library
This project can be implemented using Python's standard library: `http.server` for the web server, `sqlite3` for the database backend, `html` and `html.parser` for HTML generation and processing, `re` for text processing, `json` for data serialization, `hashlib` and `secrets` for secure authentication, `mimetypes` for file type handling, `urllib` for URL parsing and manipulation, `concurrent.futures` for handling concurrent requests, and `email` for notification functionality. The template engine can be built using `string.Template` or a custom implementation.

## Target Users
Small business owners, bloggers, community organizations, educators, and anyone who needs a simple yet flexible system for managing web content without extensive technical knowledge or external dependencies.

The project showcases MVC architecture, repository pattern for data access, template method pattern for content processing, strategy pattern for different content types, observer pattern for content update events, and facade pattern for subsystem interaction. It also demonstrates proper security practices, database design, and HTTP request handling.
