# Data Migration Framework

## Requester Identity
A database administrator managing multiple applications who frequently needs to migrate data between different systems and formats. They require a reliable framework that handles schema transformations, data validation, and incremental migrations with rollback capabilities.

## Project Title
PyMigrate - Universal Data Migration and Transformation Framework

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyMigrate is a robust framework for orchestrating complex data migrations between different storage systems, file formats, and schemas. It provides transaction-like semantics with rollback support, data validation pipelines, and progress tracking, making large-scale data migrations reliable and repeatable while maintaining data integrity throughout the process.

## Key Features
1. Declarative migration definitions with dependency management
2. Transactional migrations with checkpoint and rollback support
3. Data transformation pipelines with validation rules
4. Incremental migration support with change detection
5. Multi-source and multi-target migration orchestration

## Implementation with Standard Library
The framework uses `sqlite3` for migration metadata tracking, `csv`, `json`, and `xml.etree` for data formats, `abc` for defining migration interfaces, `queue` for pipeline processing, `threading` for parallel migrations, `hashlib` for data fingerprinting, `pickle` for state serialization, `contextlib` for transaction management, `logging` for detailed migration logs, and `weakref` for memory-efficient large dataset handling. Custom transformation DSL uses ast module.

## Target Users
Database administrators, data engineers, system migration specialists, ETL developers, and teams consolidating or modernizing data infrastructure.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project demonstrates pipeline architecture, command pattern for migrations, memento pattern for rollbacks, strategy pattern for transformers, transaction management concepts, and state machine for migration lifecycle.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Real-time change data capture support
2. Schema inference and auto-mapping
3. Data quality scoring and reporting
4. Distributed migration coordination
5. Migration testing and dry-run mode
6. Performance optimization advisor
7. Conflict resolution strategies
8. Migration scheduling and automation
9. Data anonymization during migration
10. Cloud-to-cloud migration support
