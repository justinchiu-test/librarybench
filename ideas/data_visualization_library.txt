# Data Visualization Library

## Requester Identity
A data analyst who frequently needs to generate visualizations for reports but works in environments where installing external packages is restricted due to security policies. They need a solution that works with Python's standard library while still producing professional-quality visuals.

## Project Title
PyViz - Standard Library Data Visualization Framework

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyViz is a data visualization library that creates high-quality charts and graphs using only Python's standard library. It generates SVG or HTML/CSS-based visualizations that can be viewed in any modern browser, providing a lightweight alternative to heavier visualization libraries while maintaining visual appeal and interactivity.

## Key Features
1. Support for common chart types (bar, line, scatter, pie, heatmap, etc.) with customizable styling
2. SVG generation with no external dependencies for clean, scalable graphics
3. Interactive elements using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
4. Automatic scaling and axis generation based on input data
5. Export options including SVG, HTML, and PNG formats

## Implementation with Standard Library
This project can be implemented using Python's standard library: `xml.etree.ElementTree` for SVG generation, `html` and `html.parser` for HTML manipulation, `json` for data serialization, `statistics` for data analysis functions, `collections` for data management, `base64` for embedding images, `argparse` for command-line interface options, `csv` for reading dataset files, `io` for file handling, and `math` for calculations. The SVG generation would involve creating path elements and transforms directly through XML manipulation.

## Target Users
Data analysts, business intelligence professionals, researchers working in restricted environments, developers creating data-driven applications, and educators teaching data visualization concepts.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project showcases factory pattern for chart creation, builder pattern for constructing complex visualizations, strategy pattern for different rendering targets, composite pattern for combining chart elements, and fluent interfaces for an intuitive API. It also demonstrates XML/SVG manipulation, coordinate system transformations, scaling algorithms, and color theory application.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Animation capabilities for dynamic data representation
2. Dashboard layout system for combining multiple visualizations
3. Statistical analysis functions integrated with visualization
4. Geographic mapping capabilities with custom projections
5. Data streaming support for real-time visualization updates
6. Advanced interaction patterns like brushing and linking
7. Template system for consistent corporate visual styling
8. Custom shape and marker definitions for specialized plots
9. Annotation and custom labeling system for detailed explanations
10. Integration with common data structures from scientific computing
