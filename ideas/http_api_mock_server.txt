# HTTP API Mock Server

## Requester Identity
A frontend developer working on a React application who needs to develop against backend APIs that are still under development. They want to create realistic mock responses to test various scenarios including error conditions and edge cases without waiting for the actual backend.

## Project Title
PyMockAPI - Dynamic HTTP API Mocking Server with Scenario Management

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyMockAPI is a flexible HTTP server that simulates REST APIs based on configurable rules and scenarios. It allows developers to define endpoints, response patterns, and dynamic behaviors to create realistic API mocks for testing, development, and demonstration purposes, supporting various HTTP methods, status codes, and response delays.

## Key Features
1. Dynamic route configuration with path parameters and query string matching
2. Scenario-based responses with conditional logic and state management
3. Request recording and playback for regression testing
4. Response templating with dynamic data generation
5. Latency simulation and error injection for resilience testing

## Implementation with Standard Library
The server uses `http.server` and `socketserver` for HTTP handling, `urllib.parse` for URL parsing, `json` for request/response data, `re` for route pattern matching, `random` for data generation, `time` for delay simulation, `threading` for concurrent request handling, `sqlite3` for storing request history, `string.Template` for response templating, and `hashlib` for generating consistent fake data. WebSocket support can be added using `asyncio`.

## Target Users
Frontend developers, QA engineers, API developers, mobile app developers, teams practicing API-first development, and anyone needing to test against unavailable or unstable external services.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project showcases decorator pattern for route registration, chain of responsibility for request handling, state pattern for scenario management, factory pattern for response generation, proxy pattern for request interception, and middleware architecture.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. GraphQL mock server support
2. OpenAPI/Swagger specification import
3. Proxy mode to record real API responses
4. Load testing capabilities with concurrent users
5. Authentication and authorization simulation
6. WebSocket endpoint mocking
7. Binary data and file upload handling
8. Response transformation pipelines
9. Multi-tenant mock server isolation
10. Integration with browser developer tools
