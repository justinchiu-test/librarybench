# Incremental Backup System

## Requester Identity
A freelance software developer who works on multiple client projects and needs a reliable backup system that minimizes storage requirements while preserving file history. They want full control over their backup process without relying on proprietary cloud solutions.

## Project Title
PyBackup - An Incremental File Backup System

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyBackup is an efficient incremental backup system that intelligently tracks file changes and creates space-optimized backups with full version history. It uses file checksums and delta encoding to store only the changes between versions, allowing users to restore files to any point in time while minimizing storage requirements.

## Key Features
1. Incremental backups with efficient delta storage for changed files
2. Configurable backup policies with scheduling and retention rules
3. File deduplication using content-based addressing
4. Point-in-time restoration capabilities with browsable history
5. Verification and integrity checking of backup archives

## Implementation with Standard Library
The system leverages `os` and `pathlib` for file system traversal, `hashlib` for file checksumming, `difflib` for generating file deltas, `sqlite3` for the backup catalog database, `tarfile` and `zipfile` for archive creation, `shutil` for file operations, `datetime` and `time` for scheduling, `concurrent.futures` for parallel backups, `logging` for backup logs, and `argparse` for the command-line interface.

## Target Users
Software developers, freelancers with critical data, small business owners, system administrators, photographers, and anyone needing reliable, space-efficient backups with version history.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project showcases chain of responsibility pattern for backup stages, strategy pattern for different storage backends, observer pattern for backup events, and command pattern for operations. It demonstrates binary diffing algorithms, content-based addressing, efficient file traversal, and secure storage techniques with data integrity verification.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Encrypted backups with key management
2. Remote storage support via SFTP or WebDAV
3. Bandwidth-efficient synchronization between multiple computers
4. Snapshot browsing through virtual filesystem mounting
5. Selective backup and restoration based on regex patterns
6. Backup staging and verification environments
7. Continuous data protection mode for real-time changes
8. Integration with system snapshot capabilities
9. Backup chain optimization and consolidation
10. Smart scheduling based on system load and resource availability
