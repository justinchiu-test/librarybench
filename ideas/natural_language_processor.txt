# Natural Language Processor

## Requester Identity
A computational linguistics student who wants to build a natural language processing toolkit to analyze texts without relying on external libraries. They aim to deepen their understanding of NLP fundamentals by implementing algorithms from scratch.

## Project Title
PyText - A Pure Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyText is a comprehensive natural language processing toolkit that provides text analysis, transformation, and generation capabilities using only Python's standard library. It enables users to tokenize, parse, analyze sentiment, extract entities, and perform statistical analysis on text data without external dependencies.

## Key Features
1. Tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging using rule-based algorithms
2. Statistical text analysis with TF-IDF, co-occurrence matrices, and n-gram models
3. Basic sentiment analysis using lexicon-based approaches
4. Named entity recognition with pattern matching and gazetteers
5. Text summarization using extractive methods

## Implementation with Standard Library
The toolkit leverages `re` for regular expression pattern matching, `collections` for frequency counting and data structures, `string` for text manipulation, `functools` for higher-order functions, `itertools` for efficient iteration, `json` for storing lexicons and models, `pickle` for serialization, `heapq` for priority queue operations in algorithms, and `statistics` for numerical analysis. It also uses `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing of larger texts.

## Target Users
Linguistics students, text analysis researchers, data scientists with limited dependency options, developers working on text-heavy applications, and educators teaching NLP fundamentals.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project demonstrates pipeline architecture, factory method pattern for different analyzers, strategy pattern for various algorithms, visitor pattern for traversing parse trees, and composite pattern for representing text structures. It showcases effective use of functional programming concepts, regular expressions, statistical modeling, and computational linguistics algorithms.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Basic machine learning capabilities using homegrown implementations
2. Language detection and multilingual support
3. Text generation using Markov chains or n-gram models
4. Fuzzy string matching and spelling correction
5. Topic modeling with basic Latent Semantic Analysis
6. Rule-based chatbot or question-answering system
7. Coreference resolution for pronoun disambiguation
8. Word embedding creation using co-occurrence statistics
9. Text classification for genre or category prediction
10. Command-line interface for quick text analysis tasks
