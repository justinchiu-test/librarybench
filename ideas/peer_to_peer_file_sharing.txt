# Peer-to-Peer File Sharing

## Requester Identity
A systems engineer passionate about decentralized networking who wants to understand distributed protocols by building a functional P2P file sharing system. They believe in learning by implementation and want to explore the challenges of peer discovery and distributed data transfer.

## Project Title
PeerShare - A Pure Python Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PeerShare is a lightweight peer-to-peer file sharing system that enables users to share, discover, and transfer files directly between computers without central servers. It implements a distributed hash table for peer discovery, chunk-based file transfer protocols, and verification mechanisms to ensure data integrity during transfers.

## Key Features
1. Decentralized peer discovery using a simplified Kademlia DHT implementation
2. Chunked file transfer with parallel downloading from multiple peers
3. Cryptographic verification of file chunks using hashlib
4. NAT traversal techniques for connecting peers behind firewalls
5. Bandwidth management and throttling controls

## Implementation with Standard Library
The system utilizes `socket` for network communication, `threading` and `asyncio` for concurrent operations, `hashlib` for cryptographic file verification, `os` and `pathlib` for file system interactions, `pickle` and `json` for data serialization, `tempfile` for managing partial downloads, `base64` for encoding, `struct` for binary data handling, and `logging` for diagnostic information. The `selectors` module helps with non-blocking I/O for network communication.

## Target Users
Developers learning about distributed systems, computer networking students, privacy-conscious users who prefer decentralized solutions, and small teams needing to share files without setting up central servers.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project showcases distributed systems design, peer-to-peer architecture, distributed hash tables, binary protocols, and network programming. It demonstrates concepts like eventual consistency, Byzantine fault tolerance, concurrent programming with thread synchronization, and network traversal techniques.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. End-to-end encryption for secure file transfers
2. WebRTC integration for browser-based peer connections
3. Distributed search functionality for finding files across the network
4. Reputation and trust system for ranking reliable peers
5. Mesh network capabilities for local network file sharing
6. Resumable transfers for handling connection interruptions
7. Bandwidth sharing economy with credit system
8. Mobile device support with power-aware protocols
9. Integration with version control for collaborative file editing
10. Distributed content delivery network capabilities
