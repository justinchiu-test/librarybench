# Query Language Interpreter

## Requester Identity
A data scientist at a research institute who needs to analyze complex datasets without relying on external database systems. They seek a lightweight, customizable solution that can be embedded within their research applications.

## Project Title
Query Language Interpreter - A Flexible Data Query Engine

## Core Functionality and Purpose
The Query Language Interpreter provides a SQL-like querying capability for in-memory data structures, CSV files, and JSON data. It parses custom query syntax, builds execution plans, and returns query results, allowing users to filter, join, aggregate, and transform data without external database dependencies.

## Key Features
1. Custom query language with support for SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, and aggregate functions
2. Query execution engine with optimization capabilities
3. Support for multiple data sources including in-memory objects, CSV files, and JSON
4. Result pagination and streaming for large datasets
5. Extensible architecture for adding custom functions and operators

## Implementation with Standard Library
This project leverages Python's standard library extensively: `re` for query parsing, `csv` and `json` for data source handling, `collections` for efficient data structures, `itertools` for advanced iteration, `functools` for higher-order functions, `operator` for comparison operations, and `ast` for expression evaluation. The `typing` module provides type hints for better code organization, while `concurrent.futures` enables parallel query execution when possible.

## Target Users
Data analysts, researchers, developers working with data processing applications, and anyone who needs to query structured data without deploying a full database system.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The interpreter showcases parser design, interpreter pattern, visitor pattern, strategy pattern for different execution approaches, decorator pattern for query optimization, composite pattern for complex query trees, and iterator pattern for efficient data processing.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Schema inference and validation capabilities
2. Integration with pandas DataFrames as a data source and result type
3. Caching mechanisms for frequently executed queries
4. Query history and performance analysis tools
5. Support for user-defined functions and aggregates
6. Transaction support for data modification operations
7. Access control and security features
8. Export capabilities to various formats
9. Visual query builder interface using curses
10. Distributed query execution for processing larger datasets
