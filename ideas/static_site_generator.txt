# Static Site Generator

## Requester Identity
A technical writer who regularly produces documentation and wants to convert simple markup files into professional-looking websites without dealing with complex web frameworks. They prefer tools that are lightweight and focused on content over configuration.

## Project Title
PySite - A Flexible Static Site Generator

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PySite is a static site generator that transforms lightweight markup files into fully-featured websites complete with navigation, search functionality, and customizable themes. It emphasizes content-first development, allowing users to focus on writing while the system handles the complexities of generating a cohesive, responsive website.

## Key Features
1. Support for multiple markup formats (Markdown, reStructuredText) with custom extensions
2. Flexible templating system with inheritance and partials for consistent site structure
3. Built-in development server with live reload for immediate preview
4. Automatic sitemap, RSS feed, and search index generation
5. Asset management with optional minification and optimization

## Implementation with Standard Library
This project can be implemented using Python's standard library: `markdown` or custom parsers using `re` for converting markup to HTML, `string.Template` or a custom templating engine for layouts, `http.server` for the development server, `os` and `pathlib` for file operations, `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing of content files, `json` for configuration and data files, `xml.etree` for generating sitemaps and RSS feeds, `functools` for caching rendered content, and `shutil` for file operations during the build process.

## Target Users
Technical writers, bloggers, developers creating documentation, small businesses needing simple websites, and educators creating course materials.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project demonstrates template method pattern for build processes, strategy pattern for different markup processors, observer pattern for live reload functionality, visitor pattern for site traversal, and decorator pattern for markup extensions. It also showcases parsing and transformation pipelines, metadata extraction and processing, and efficient file handling.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Incremental build system that only processes changed files
2. Internationalization support with multilingual content management
3. Integrated image processing with responsive images generation
4. Data-driven content generation from CSV, JSON, or YAML sources
5. Plugin system for extending functionality with third-party modules
6. Integrated analytics and performance monitoring
7. Draft and scheduling system for content planning
8. Deployment automation to popular hosting services
9. Content validation and linting for quality assurance
10. Advanced taxonomy system with categories, tags, and custom relations
