# System Monitoring Dashboard

## Requester Identity
A DevOps engineer responsible for maintaining multiple servers who needs a lightweight monitoring solution that doesn't require additional infrastructure. They want to quickly identify performance issues and track system metrics without installing heavy monitoring stacks.

## Project Title
PyMonitor - A Python System Monitoring Dashboard

## Core Functionality and Purpose
PyMonitor is a lightweight yet comprehensive system monitoring dashboard that collects, visualizes, and alerts on system performance metrics using only Python's standard library. It provides real-time insights into CPU, memory, disk, and network usage through a web-based dashboard or terminal interface, enabling administrators to quickly identify bottlenecks and potential issues.

## Key Features
1. Real-time collection of system metrics with minimal overhead
2. Configurable dashboards with ASCII/Unicode charts for terminal or HTML visualizations for browsers
3. Threshold-based alerting via email, log files, or terminal notifications
4. Historical data storage and trend analysis using simple file-based databases
5. Remote monitoring capabilities via SSH or simple secure socket connections

## Implementation with Standard Library
The application utilizes `psutil` (or platform-specific alternatives from stdlib), `socket` for network communication, `http.server` for the web interface, `sqlite3` for metrics storage, `smtplib` for email alerts, `asyncio` for non-blocking operations, `concurrent.futures` for parallel metric collection, `json` for data serialization, `time` and `datetime` for timestamping, and `curses` for the terminal user interface. The `subprocess` module helps gather additional system information.

## Target Users
System administrators, DevOps engineers, small business IT staff, self-hosting enthusiasts, and anyone managing servers who needs lightweight monitoring without complex infrastructure.

## Programming Concepts and Patterns
The project demonstrates observer pattern for metric changes, strategy pattern for different visualization methods, factory method for alert types, and repository pattern for data storage. It showcases event-driven programming, time series data management, threshold detection algorithms, and efficient system resource utilization.

## Possible Extensions or Variations
1. Process-level monitoring and profiling capabilities
2. Distributed monitoring across multiple servers with aggregated views
3. Anomaly detection using statistical methods
4. Custom plugin system for monitoring application-specific metrics
5. Predictive analytics for resource usage forecasting
6. Integration with service management for restart capabilities
7. Log aggregation and analysis features
8. Network topology mapping and visualization
9. Security monitoring for failed login attempts and suspicious activities
10. API integration with notification services like Slack or Telegram
