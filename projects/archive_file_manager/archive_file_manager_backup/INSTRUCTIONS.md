# Enterprise Backup Archive System

## Overview
A specialized archive management system designed for backup system administrators to manage enterprise backup solutions across heterogeneous systems with robust archiving capabilities that integrate with existing backup infrastructure.

## Persona Description
An IT administrator managing enterprise backup solutions across heterogeneous systems. They need robust archiving capabilities that integrate with existing backup infrastructure.

## Key Requirements

1. **Incremental Archive Chains with Efficient Block-Level Deduplication**
   - Critical for minimizing storage usage and backup windows
   - Implement block-level deduplication across backup sets
   - Support incremental chains with full, differential, and incremental backups
   - Enable synthetic full backup generation from incremental chains
   - Maintain deduplication tables for cross-backup optimization

2. **Archive Catalog Database for Fast Search Across Multiple Backup Sets**
   - Essential for quickly locating files across thousands of backups
   - Build searchable catalog of all archived content
   - Support metadata queries (date, size, permissions, location)
   - Enable point-in-time browsing of backup contents
   - Provide catalog synchronization across distributed sites

3. **Bandwidth-Throttled Archive Transfer with Resume Capabilities**
   - Necessary for WAN transfers without impacting production traffic
   - Implement adaptive bandwidth throttling based on network conditions
   - Support resumable transfers for unreliable connections
   - Enable multi-stream transfers for better throughput
   - Provide transfer scheduling for off-peak operations

4. **Archive Verification Scheduling with Automated Repair Procedures**
   - Required for ensuring backup integrity and recoverability
   - Schedule periodic verification of archive integrity
   - Implement self-healing for detected corruption
   - Support background verification without impacting operations
   - Generate compliance reports for audit requirements

5. **Multi-Destination Archive Replication with Consistency Checking**
   - Critical for disaster recovery and data redundancy
   - Replicate archives to multiple geographic locations
   - Ensure consistency across all replica copies
   - Support different replication topologies (hub-spoke, mesh)
   - Enable selective replication based on policies

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functions must be thoroughly testable via pytest
- Mock network operations for transfer testing
- Simulate various backup scenarios and failures
- Test deduplication with known data patterns

### Performance Expectations
- Achieve 90%+ deduplication ratio for typical data
- Search catalog of 10 million files in under 1 second
- Transfer at 80%+ of available bandwidth
- Verify 1TB of archives per hour
- Support 100+ concurrent backup streams

### Integration Points
- Backup software APIs (Veeam, Commvault, NetBackup)
- Cloud storage providers (AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
- Tape library systems
- Storage arrays and deduplication appliances
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Key Constraints
- Maintain backup consistency during all operations
- Support heterogeneous OS environments
- Handle multi-petabyte scale deployments
- Comply with retention policies and regulations

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The enterprise backup archive tool must provide:

1. **Deduplication Engine**
   - Block-level fingerprinting
   - Deduplication table management
   - Reference counting
   - Garbage collection
   - Compression integration

2. **Catalog System**
   - Metadata indexing
   - Search optimization
   - Catalog maintenance
   - Cross-reference tracking
   - Performance tuning

3. **Transfer Management**
   - Bandwidth control
   - Resume capability
   - Queue management
   - Progress tracking
   - Error recovery

4. **Verification Framework**
   - Integrity checking
   - Repair procedures
   - Schedule management
   - Report generation
   - Alert integration

5. **Replication Engine**
   - Multi-site coordination
   - Consistency verification
   - Conflict resolution
   - Policy enforcement
   - Status monitoring

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Deduplication achieves expected storage savings
- Catalog searches return accurate results quickly
- Transfers resume correctly after interruption
- Verification detects and repairs corruption
- Replication maintains consistency across sites

### Critical User Scenarios
- Create incremental backup chain over 30 days
- Search for specific file across 1 year of backups
- Transfer 10TB backup over WAN with interruptions
- Verify and repair corrupted backup archive
- Replicate critical backups to 3 geographic locations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Deduplicate 10TB of data with 90% reduction
- Index 100 million files in catalog
- Transfer at 1Gbps with throttling active
- Verify 100TB of archives in 24 hours
- Replicate to 5 sites simultaneously

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handle deduplication table corruption
- Process backups with missing catalog entries
- Manage network failures during transfers
- Deal with conflicting replication policies
- Recover from storage media failures

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- All deduplication algorithms tested thoroughly
- Transfer reliability under various conditions
- Verification accuracy validated
- Replication consistency guaranteed

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Storage Efficiency**: Achieves 90%+ deduplication for typical enterprise data
2. **Search Performance**: Locates any file in multi-petabyte archives within seconds
3. **Transfer Reliability**: Completes transfers despite network interruptions
4. **Data Integrity**: Detects and repairs corruption automatically
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Maintains consistent replicas across all sites
6. **Scalability**: Handles enterprise-scale deployments efficiently
7. **Performance**: Meets all specified performance benchmarks
8. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing backup infrastructure

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

Use `uv venv` to setup virtual environments. From within the project directory:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Final Deliverable Requirements

The completed implementation must include:
1. Python package with all enterprise backup archive functionality
2. Comprehensive pytest test suite
3. Generated pytest_results.json showing all tests passing
4. No UI components - only programmatic interfaces
5. Full compliance with enterprise backup best practices
