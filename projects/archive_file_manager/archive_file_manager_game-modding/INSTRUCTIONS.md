# Game Mod Archive Manager

## Overview
A comprehensive archive management system tailored for game modding community managers to validate, repackage, and distribute thousands of user-generated modifications efficiently while ensuring security, authenticity, and optimal delivery.

## Persona Description
A community leader who manages user-generated content for video games, handling thousands of mod archives daily. They need efficient tools to validate, repackage, and distribute community modifications.

## Key Requirements

1. **Batch Validation of Archive Structure Against Mod Specification Templates**
   - Essential for ensuring mods follow game-specific structure requirements
   - Validate folder hierarchies, required files, and naming conventions
   - Support custom validation rules for different game engines and mod types
   - Process hundreds of archives in parallel with detailed validation reports

2. **Automatic Archive Repacking with Optimized Compression**
   - Critical for reducing download times and server bandwidth costs
   - Intelligently choose compression algorithms based on file types
   - Remove unnecessary files (source files, development assets)
   - Maintain mod functionality while achieving optimal file sizes

3. **Metadata Injection for Mod Versioning and Dependency Tracking**
   - Required for managing complex mod ecosystems with interdependencies
   - Embed version numbers, author information, and compatibility data
   - Track dependencies between mods to prevent conflicts
   - Generate dependency graphs for installation order determination

4. **Multi-threaded Archive Content Scanning for Prohibited Files**
   - Necessary for community safety and legal compliance
   - Scan for malicious code, inappropriate content, and copyright violations
   - Use signature-based detection for known problematic files
   - Quarantine suspicious archives for manual review

5. **Archive Signing with Digital Certificates for Authenticity**
   - Essential for preventing mod tampering and ensuring trust
   - Implement PKI-based signing for verified mod authors
   - Support multiple signature algorithms for different platforms
   - Verify signatures during mod installation process

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All validation rules must be unit testable
- Mock archive operations for testing without actual files
- Simulate various mod structures and corruption scenarios
- Test security scanning with known malicious patterns

### Performance Expectations
- Process 1000+ mod archives per hour
- Parallel validation across multiple CPU cores
- Optimize compression without blocking other operations
- Real-time signature verification during downloads

### Integration Points
- Game launcher APIs for mod distribution
- Content delivery networks (CDN) for optimized distribution
- Version control systems for mod development
- Community platforms (Discord, forums) for notifications

### Key Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with legacy mod formats
- Support mods ranging from kilobytes to gigabytes
- Handle archives from various operating systems
- Respect intellectual property and licensing

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The mod archive manager must provide:

1. **Mod Validation Engine**
   - Template-based structure validation
   - Custom rule definition system
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Detailed error reporting

2. **Intelligent Repackaging System**
   - File type aware compression
   - Asset optimization (texture compression, audio encoding)
   - Removal of development artifacts
   - Preservation of mod functionality

3. **Metadata Management**
   - Standardized metadata format
   - Dependency resolution algorithms
   - Version comparison logic
   - Compatibility matrix generation

4. **Security Scanning Framework**
   - Pattern-based malware detection
   - Content policy enforcement
   - Automated quarantine system
   - Scan result caching

5. **Digital Signature Infrastructure**
   - Certificate management
   - Signature generation and verification
   - Trust chain validation
   - Revocation list support

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Validation correctly identifies non-compliant mod structures
- Repacking reduces file sizes while maintaining functionality
- Metadata injection preserves archive integrity
- Security scanning detects all test malicious patterns
- Digital signatures verify correctly across platforms

### Critical User Scenarios
- Validate and approve a batch of 100 community-submitted mods
- Repackage large texture mods for optimal distribution
- Track complex dependency chains across multiple mod versions
- Detect and quarantine a mod containing prohibited content
- Sign and distribute verified mods to thousands of users

### Performance Benchmarks
- Validate mod structure in under 100ms per archive
- Achieve 30-50% compression improvement on typical mods
- Scan 1GB archive for prohibited content in under 60 seconds
- Generate and verify signatures in under 500ms

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handle corrupted archives without crashing validation pipeline
- Process mods with circular dependencies gracefully
- Manage archives exceeding filesystem limitations
- Recover from interrupted repackaging operations
- Handle invalid or expired certificates appropriately

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 85% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage for security scanning functions
- All compression algorithms must be thoroughly tested
- Integration tests for complete mod processing pipeline

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Validation Accuracy**: Correctly identifies 100% of non-compliant mod structures
2. **Compression Efficiency**: Achieves average 40% size reduction without quality loss
3. **Metadata Integrity**: All injected metadata is retrievable and accurate
4. **Security Effectiveness**: Detects all known malicious patterns in test set
5. **Signature Reliability**: Zero false positives in authenticity verification
6. **Processing Speed**: Meets all performance benchmarks under load
7. **Scalability**: Handles growing mod library without degradation
8. **Community Trust**: Provides transparent, auditable mod processing

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

Use `uv venv` to setup virtual environments. From within the project directory:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Final Deliverable Requirements

The completed implementation must include:
1. Python package with all mod management functionality
2. Comprehensive pytest test suite
3. Generated pytest_results.json showing all tests passing
4. No UI components - only programmatic interfaces
5. Full support for common game modding scenarios
