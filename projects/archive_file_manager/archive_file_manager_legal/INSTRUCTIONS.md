# Legal Document Archive System

## Overview
A specialized archive management system designed for legal document processors to manage case files containing millions of documents while maintaining document relationships, enabling efficient court submissions, and supporting document search capabilities.

## Persona Description
A paralegal who manages case files containing millions of documents across multiple formats. They need to create organized archives for court submissions while maintaining document relationships.

## Key Requirements

1. **OCR Integration for Searchable Archive Creation from Scanned Documents**
   - Critical for making legacy paper documents searchable within archives
   - Integrate with OCR engines to process scanned PDFs and images
   - Store OCR text alongside original documents for search indexing
   - Support batch OCR processing for large document sets
   - Maintain OCR confidence scores for quality assessment

2. **Hierarchical Archive Structure Matching Legal Filing Systems**
   - Essential for organizing documents according to court requirements
   - Implement multi-level folder structures (case/party/document type/date)
   - Support legal numbering systems (Bates numbering, exhibit numbers)
   - Enable folder templates for different types of legal proceedings
   - Maintain sort orders that match legal filing conventions

3. **Redaction-Aware Compression That Preserves Document Modifications**
   - Necessary for handling confidential information while maintaining document integrity
   - Preserve redaction layers as separate data streams
   - Support multiple redaction versions for different privilege levels
   - Maintain audit trails of who applied which redactions
   - Ensure redacted content cannot be recovered from compressed data

4. **Archive Table of Contents Generation in Multiple Formats**
   - Required for court filings and easy navigation of large document sets
   - Generate detailed indexes in PDF, HTML, and XML formats
   - Include hyperlinks to documents within the archive
   - Support customizable TOC templates for different jurisdictions
   - Auto-generate exhibit lists and document summaries

5. **Cross-Reference Preservation for Linked Documents**
   - Critical for maintaining legal document relationships and citations
   - Track and preserve hyperlinks between documents
   - Maintain citation chains and reference mappings
   - Support bi-directional link navigation
   - Generate relationship graphs for complex document sets

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functions must be thoroughly testable via pytest
- Mock OCR operations for consistent testing
- Simulate various legal document structures
- Test redaction preservation and security

### Performance Expectations
- Process archives containing 1 million+ documents
- OCR throughput of at least 100 pages per minute
- Generate TOC for 10,000 documents in under 30 seconds
- Support archives up to 500GB in size
- Handle concurrent access from multiple legal team members

### Integration Points
- OCR engine APIs (Tesseract, ABBYY, etc.)
- Legal document management systems
- E-filing system compatibility
- PDF manipulation libraries
- Full-text search engines

### Key Constraints
- Maintain document authenticity for legal admissibility
- Preserve all metadata required for legal proceedings
- Support long-term archival (10+ years)
- Comply with jurisdiction-specific filing requirements

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The legal document archive tool must provide:

1. **Document Processing**
   - OCR integration and text extraction
   - Metadata extraction and preservation
   - Document format conversion
   - Batch processing capabilities

2. **Legal Organization**
   - Hierarchical structure management
   - Legal numbering system support
   - Filing template application
   - Sort order maintenance

3. **Redaction Management**
   - Secure redaction preservation
   - Multi-version redaction support
   - Privilege level handling
   - Audit trail generation

4. **Index Generation**
   - Multi-format TOC creation
   - Hyperlink generation
   - Exhibit list compilation
   - Document summarization

5. **Relationship Tracking**
   - Cross-reference preservation
   - Citation chain management
   - Link integrity verification
   - Relationship visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- OCR accuracy and text extraction from various document types
- Hierarchical structure maintains legal filing order
- Redactions remain secure through compression cycles
- TOC generation includes all documents with correct links
- Cross-references remain valid after archive operations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Create searchable archive from box of scanned discovery documents
- Organize documents according to federal court filing requirements
- Apply and preserve multiple redaction levels for different parties
- Generate comprehensive index for appellate brief appendix
- Maintain citation links in complex legal memoranda

### Performance Benchmarks
- OCR and compress 10,000 pages in under 2 hours
- Navigate 5-level hierarchy with 100,000 documents instantly
- Apply redactions to 1,000 documents in under 5 minutes
- Generate PDF index for 50,000 documents in under 1 minute
- Verify all cross-references in 100,000 document archive

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handle corrupted PDFs and illegible scanned documents
- Process documents with complex layouts and tables
- Manage circular reference chains between documents
- Deal with mixed character encodings and languages
- Recover from interrupted OCR batch operations

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- All OCR integration paths must be tested
- Redaction security must have 100% coverage
- Legal compliance features thoroughly validated
- Cross-reference integrity verification

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **OCR Integration**: Scanned documents become fully searchable within archives
2. **Legal Compliance**: Archive structure matches court filing requirements exactly
3. **Redaction Security**: Redacted content remains permanently inaccessible
4. **Index Quality**: Generated TOCs meet legal professional standards
5. **Reference Integrity**: All document relationships preserved accurately
6. **Performance**: Meets all specified performance benchmarks
7. **Reliability**: Handles large document sets without errors or data loss
8. **Compatibility**: Works with standard legal tech tools and systems

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

Use `uv venv` to setup virtual environments. From within the project directory:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Final Deliverable Requirements

The completed implementation must include:
1. Python package with all legal document archive functionality
2. Comprehensive pytest test suite
3. Generated pytest_results.json showing all tests passing
4. No UI components - only programmatic interfaces
5. Full compliance with legal document handling standards
