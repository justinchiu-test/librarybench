# Digital Library Archive System

## Overview
A specialized archive management system designed for digital librarians to preserve historical documents and rare books while maintaining cultural context, supporting metadata standards, and enabling long-term digital preservation strategies.

## Persona Description
A library science professional digitizing and preserving historical documents and rare books. They need to create archives that preserve not just content but also cultural context and metadata.

## Key Requirements

1. **METS/MODS Metadata Standard Support for Cultural Heritage Preservation**
   - Critical for interoperability with library systems worldwide
   - Implement full METS (Metadata Encoding & Transmission Standard) support
   - Support MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) for descriptive metadata
   - Handle PREMIS for preservation metadata
   - Enable Dublin Core crosswalks for compatibility

2. **Archive Versioning with Detailed Provenance Tracking**
   - Essential for documenting the history and authenticity of digital objects
   - Track all modifications with who, what, when, why documentation
   - Support branching for different digitization approaches
   - Maintain chain of custody for historical artifacts
   - Document scanning equipment and settings used

3. **Multi-Language Metadata Support with Unicode Normalization**
   - Necessary for preserving documents in diverse languages and scripts
   - Full Unicode support including historical scripts
   - Implement NFD/NFC normalization for consistent storage
   - Support right-to-left and vertical text metadata
   - Handle transliteration and romanization metadata

4. **Archive Format Migration Tools for Long-Term Preservation**
   - Required for ensuring content remains accessible as formats become obsolete
   - Migrate between archive formats while preserving all metadata
   - Support format risk assessment and migration planning
   - Maintain migration history and validation reports
   - Enable round-trip testing for format conversions

5. **Embedded Viewer Generation for Self-Contained Archive Browsing**
   - Critical for making archives accessible without specialized software
   - Generate HTML5-based viewers embedded in archives
   - Support image galleries, document readers, and metadata displays
   - Include search functionality within embedded viewers
   - Ensure viewers work offline and across platforms

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functions must be thoroughly testable via pytest
- Mock metadata standards for consistent testing
- Simulate various language encodings and scripts
- Test format migrations with known transformations

### Performance Expectations
- Process archives containing 1 million+ digitized pages
- Handle metadata in 100+ languages simultaneously
- Generate viewers for 10,000 item collections
- Support archives up to 1TB in size
- Migrate formats at 100MB/s or faster

### Integration Points
- Library management systems (Alma, WorldCat)
- Digital repository platforms (DSpace, Fedora)
- Metadata harvesting protocols (OAI-PMH)
- Preservation systems (Archivematica, Preservica)
- IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)

### Key Constraints
- Maintain metadata standard compliance
- Preserve all cultural and linguistic information
- Support 100+ year preservation strategies
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG)

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The digital library archive tool must provide:

1. **Metadata Standards Implementation**
   - METS/MODS schema validation
   - PREMIS event tracking
   - Dublin Core mapping
   - Custom schema support
   - Metadata extraction and embedding

2. **Provenance Management**
   - Version control integration
   - Audit trail generation
   - Digital signatures
   - Contributor tracking
   - Equipment documentation

3. **Multilingual Support**
   - Unicode handling
   - Script detection
   - Normalization strategies
   - Collation rules
   - Language tagging

4. **Preservation Migration**
   - Format risk assessment
   - Migration pathways
   - Validation frameworks
   - Quality assurance
   - Rollback capabilities

5. **Access Generation**
   - HTML5 viewer creation
   - Search index building
   - Navigation structures
   - Responsive design
   - Offline functionality

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- METS/MODS metadata validates against official schemas
- Provenance tracking captures all required preservation events
- Unicode text remains intact through all operations
- Format migrations preserve all content and metadata
- Embedded viewers function correctly across browsers

### Critical User Scenarios
- Archive rare manuscript collection with full METS metadata
- Track digitization workflow from scanning to publication
- Preserve multilingual document with Arabic, Chinese, and Latin text
- Migrate 10-year-old archive to current preservation formats
- Generate searchable viewer for 18th century document collection

### Performance Benchmarks
- Validate METS metadata for 10,000 objects in under 1 minute
- Generate provenance report for 5-year project history
- Process Unicode normalization at 1GB/minute
- Complete format migration for 100GB archive in 1 hour
- Build embedded viewer for 1,000 documents in 10 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handle corrupted metadata gracefully
- Process documents with unknown character encodings
- Manage extremely long provenance chains
- Deal with obsolete format specifications
- Recover from interrupted migration operations

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- All metadata standards must be fully tested
- Unicode operations require 100% coverage
- Migration paths thoroughly validated
- Viewer generation tested across platforms

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Standards Compliance**: Full compatibility with METS/MODS and related standards
2. **Provenance Integrity**: Complete documentation of object history
3. **Language Preservation**: All multilingual content preserved accurately
4. **Format Sustainability**: Successful migration between preservation formats
5. **Access Quality**: Embedded viewers provide excellent user experience
6. **Performance**: Meets all specified performance benchmarks
7. **Interoperability**: Works with major library systems
8. **Longevity**: Supports 100+ year preservation requirements

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

Use `uv venv` to setup virtual environments. From within the project directory:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Final Deliverable Requirements

The completed implementation must include:
1. Python package with all digital library archive functionality
2. Comprehensive pytest test suite
3. Generated pytest_results.json showing all tests passing
4. No UI components - only programmatic interfaces
5. Full compliance with library and preservation standards
