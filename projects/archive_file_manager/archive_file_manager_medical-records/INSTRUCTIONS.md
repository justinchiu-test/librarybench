# HIPAA-Compliant Medical Records Archive System

## Overview
A secure archive management system designed for healthcare IT specialists to store, manage, and retrieve patient records in compliance with HIPAA regulations, featuring encryption, automated retention policies, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Persona Description
A healthcare IT specialist responsible for long-term storage of patient records in compliance with regulations. They require secure, reliable archiving with strict access controls and audit trails.

## Key Requirements

1. **HIPAA-Compliant Encryption with Key Escrow Management**
   - Mandatory for protecting patient health information (PHI)
   - Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
   - Secure key escrow system for emergency access and key recovery
   - Support for hardware security modules (HSM) integration

2. **Archive Splitting by Date Ranges for Regulatory Retention**
   - Critical for meeting varying retention requirements (e.g., 7 years for adults, 21 years for minors)
   - Automatically segregate records based on creation date and record type
   - Enable selective purging when retention periods expire
   - Maintain referential integrity across split archives

3. **Automated Archive Migration Between Storage Tiers**
   - Essential for cost-effective long-term storage management
   - Move frequently accessed records to fast storage automatically
   - Migrate older records to cheaper cold storage based on access patterns
   - Transparent retrieval regardless of storage tier

4. **Patient Data Anonymization for Research Datasets**
   - Required for creating HIPAA-compliant research databases
   - Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers while preserving data utility
   - Support configurable anonymization rules for different research needs
   - Maintain linkage capability for longitudinal studies

5. **Archive Integrity Monitoring with Corruption Detection**
   - Necessary for ensuring data reliability over decades of storage
   - Continuous background verification of archive checksums
   - Automated corruption detection with configurable alert thresholds
   - Self-healing capabilities using redundant storage

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock HIPAA compliance scenarios
- Simulate various encryption and key management operations
- Test retention policy enforcement
- Verify anonymization completeness

### Performance Expectations
- Encrypt/decrypt medical images at 50MB/s minimum
- Support archives containing millions of patient records
- Sub-second retrieval for recent records
- Handle concurrent access from multiple departments

### Integration Points
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
- Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)
- Health Information Exchanges (HIE)
- Audit log aggregation systems

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain HIPAA compliance at all times
- Zero data loss tolerance
- Support 20+ year retention periods
- Comply with state-specific healthcare regulations

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The medical records archive system must provide:

1. **Secure Encryption Framework**
   - FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption
   - Key lifecycle management
   - Emergency access procedures
   - Encryption key rotation

2. **Retention Policy Engine**
   - Rule-based retention configuration
   - Automated expiration processing
   - Legal hold capabilities
   - Disposal certification

3. **Storage Tier Management**
   - Access pattern analysis
   - Automated tier transitions
   - Cost optimization algorithms
   - Transparent data retrieval

4. **Anonymization Pipeline**
   - HIPAA identifier detection
   - Configurable scrubbing rules
   - Data utility preservation
   - Audit trail for transformations

5. **Integrity Assurance System**
   - Continuous checksum verification
   - Bit rot detection
   - Redundancy management
   - Recovery procedures

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Encryption meets HIPAA technical safeguards requirements
- Retention policies correctly identify and process expired records
- Storage migration maintains data accessibility
- Anonymization removes all PHI identifiers
- Integrity monitoring detects all forms of corruption

### Critical User Scenarios
- Archive 10,000 patient records with full encryption
- Retrieve specific patient history spanning multiple years
- Create anonymized research dataset from 100,000 records
- Migrate archives between storage tiers without downtime
- Recover from detected corruption using redundancy

### Performance Benchmarks
- Archive 1TB of medical imaging data in under 6 hours
- Retrieve any patient record in under 2 seconds
- Process retention policies for 1M records in under 30 minutes
- Complete integrity check of 10TB archive in 24 hours

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handle encryption key loss scenarios
- Process records with incomplete metadata
- Manage storage tier unavailability
- Recover from interrupted anonymization
- Handle regulatory requirement changes

### Required Test Coverage
- 95% code coverage minimum
- 100% coverage for encryption and anonymization
- All HIPAA compliance paths fully tested
- Integration tests with mock healthcare systems

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **HIPAA Compliance**: Passes all technical safeguard requirements
2. **Data Security**: Zero unauthorized access or data breaches
3. **Retention Accuracy**: 100% correct application of retention policies
4. **Anonymization Completeness**: No PHI leakage in research datasets
5. **Data Integrity**: Zero undetected corruption over time
6. **Performance**: Meets all specified benchmarks under load
7. **Auditability**: Complete audit trail for all operations
8. **Reliability**: 99.99% availability for critical operations

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

Use `uv venv` to setup virtual environments. From within the project directory:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Final Deliverable Requirements

The completed implementation must include:
1. Python package with HIPAA-compliant archive functionality
2. Comprehensive pytest test suite
3. Generated pytest_results.json showing all tests passing
4. No UI components - only programmatic interfaces
5. Full compliance with healthcare data regulations
