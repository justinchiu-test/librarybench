# Software Release Archive System

## Overview
A specialized archive management system designed for software release managers to create and distribute software packages across platforms, ensuring compatibility with various package managers and deployment tools while maintaining build reproducibility.

## Persona Description
A DevOps engineer responsible for creating and distributing software packages across platforms. They need to build archives that work seamlessly with various package managers and deployment tools.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Platform Archive Creation with Platform-Specific Metadata**
   - Essential for distributing software across Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile platforms
   - Generate platform-appropriate archive formats (MSI, DEB, RPM, DMG, APK)
   - Embed platform-specific metadata (permissions, dependencies, icons)
   - Support cross-compilation and architecture-specific builds
   - Handle platform-specific path separators and line endings

2. **Deterministic Archive Generation for Reproducible Builds**
   - Critical for security auditing and reliable deployments
   - Ensure identical inputs always produce bit-identical archives
   - Normalize file timestamps and ordering within archives
   - Remove build-environment specific paths and metadata
   - Support reproducible compression with fixed seeds

3. **Archive Signing with Multiple Signature Algorithms**
   - Required for package authenticity and integrity verification
   - Support multiple signing algorithms (RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519)
   - Implement detached and embedded signature options
   - Handle certificate chains and timestamp authorities
   - Support platform-specific signing requirements (Authenticode, GPG)

4. **Dependency Bundling with Automatic Deduplication**
   - Necessary for creating self-contained distributions
   - Detect and bundle runtime dependencies automatically
   - Deduplicate common libraries across multiple packages
   - Support vendoring of third-party dependencies
   - Track dependency versions and licenses

5. **Archive Transformation Between Package Formats**
   - Essential for maintaining single source, multiple distribution targets
   - Convert between archive formats (tar.gz to zip, deb to rpm)
   - Preserve metadata during format conversions
   - Support format-specific features through plugins
   - Maintain installation scripts across formats

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functions must be thoroughly testable via pytest
- Mock platform-specific operations for cross-platform testing
- Simulate various package formats and metadata
- Test signature verification with known keys

### Performance Expectations
- Generate release archives at 100MB/s or faster
- Support packages up to 10GB in size
- Process dependency graphs with 10,000+ nodes
- Sign archives with minimal overhead (< 1 second)
- Transform formats without full extraction when possible

### Integration Points
- CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Package registries (PyPI, npm, Maven Central)
- Container registries (Docker Hub, GitHub Packages)
- Code signing services and HSMs
- Dependency scanning tools

### Key Constraints
- Maintain compatibility with target package managers
- Preserve executable permissions and symlinks
- Support air-gapped build environments
- Handle license compliance requirements

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The software release archive tool must provide:

1. **Platform Package Generation**
   - Format-specific archive creation
   - Metadata embedding and validation
   - Platform convention compliance
   - Architecture targeting
   - Cross-platform testing

2. **Build Reproducibility**
   - Deterministic compression
   - Timestamp normalization
   - Path canonicalization
   - Environment isolation
   - Build attestation

3. **Security and Signing**
   - Multi-algorithm support
   - Key management integration
   - Certificate handling
   - Signature verification
   - Chain of trust validation

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Automatic detection
   - Version resolution
   - Deduplication strategies
   - License tracking
   - Vulnerability scanning

5. **Format Conversion**
   - Lossless transformation
   - Metadata mapping
   - Script translation
   - Feature compatibility
   - Validation testing

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Platform packages install correctly on target systems
- Reproducible builds produce identical archives
- Signatures validate with appropriate tools
- Dependencies are correctly bundled and deduplicated
- Format conversions preserve all critical metadata

### Critical User Scenarios
- Create multi-platform release from single source tree
- Generate bit-identical archives for security audit
- Sign release packages for enterprise distribution
- Bundle application with all dependencies for offline install
- Convert Linux package to Windows installer

### Performance Benchmarks
- Package 1GB application in under 10 seconds
- Generate reproducible build for 10,000 file project
- Sign 100 packages with HSM in under 1 minute
- Deduplicate 1GB of common dependencies
- Convert between major formats in linear time

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handle circular dependencies gracefully
- Process packages with conflicting version requirements
- Manage expired or revoked signing certificates
- Deal with platform-specific path length limits
- Recover from interrupted package generation

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- All platform formats must be tested
- Cryptographic operations require 100% coverage
- Dependency resolution thoroughly validated
- Format conversion accuracy verified

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Packages work correctly on all target platforms
2. **Build Reproducibility**: Identical inputs produce bit-identical outputs
3. **Security Compliance**: All packages properly signed and verifiable
4. **Dependency Efficiency**: Optimal bundling without duplication
5. **Format Flexibility**: Seamless conversion between package formats
6. **Performance**: Meets all specified performance benchmarks
7. **Reliability**: Consistent results across different environments
8. **Integration**: Works with standard CI/CD and distribution tools

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

Use `uv venv` to setup virtual environments. From within the project directory:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Final Deliverable Requirements

The completed implementation must include:
1. Python package with all software release archive functionality
2. Comprehensive pytest test suite
3. Generated pytest_results.json showing all tests passing
4. No UI components - only programmatic interfaces
5. Full compliance with software distribution best practices
