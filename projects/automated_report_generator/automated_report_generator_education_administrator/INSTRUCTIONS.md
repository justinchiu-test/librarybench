# Educational Performance Analytics System

A specialized automated report generation framework for school administrators to create differentiated student performance reports for teachers, parents, and district officials.

## Overview

The Educational Performance Analytics System is a Python-based library designed to generate comprehensive, audience-specific student performance reports. It integrates with student information systems, processes academic and demographic data, and creates tailored reports that present educational outcomes in contextually appropriate formats for different stakeholders while maintaining strict student privacy standards.

## Persona Description

Jennifer is a school administrator who needs to generate student performance reports for teachers, parents, and district officials. Her goal is to create differentiated reports that present the same underlying data in appropriate contexts for different audiences.

## Key Requirements

1. **Student Information System Integration**: Implement secure connectors to extract data from student information systems with historical trend tracking capabilities.
   - *Critical for Jennifer because*: Manually extracting data from educational databases is extremely time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with multiple years of student performance data across different subjects and grade levels.

2. **Personalized Learning Progress Visualization**: Create visualizations that effectively communicate individual student growth and achievement relative to learning objectives.
   - *Critical for Jennifer because*: Understanding each student's unique learning journey requires contextualizing current performance within their personal history, not just comparing against fixed standards or peer averages.

3. **Curriculum Standards Alignment**: Develop a mapping system that links student performance metrics to educational standards and curriculum requirements.
   - *Critical for Jennifer because*: Educational accountability requires demonstrating how student outcomes align with mandated standards, and manually maintaining these connections across changing curriculum frameworks is practically impossible.

4. **Multi-Audience Templating**: Build a sophisticated templating system that adjusts detail, terminology, and data presentation based on the report recipient's role.
   - *Critical for Jennifer because*: Different stakeholders need fundamentally different views of the same underlying dataâ€”teachers need actionable instructional insights, parents need accessible progress updates, and officials need compliance verification.

5. **FERPA-Compliant Privacy Controls**: Implement rigorous privacy mechanisms that enforce educational privacy regulations while still providing meaningful reporting.
   - *Critical for Jennifer because*: Student data privacy is legally mandated, and any breach could result in serious legal consequences while undermining parent and community trust in the school's data handling practices.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All SIS connectors must be testable with synthetic student data
- Report generation must be verifiable with sample datasets of varying complexity
- Privacy mechanisms must be testable against FERPA compliance standards
- Audience-specific templating must be verifiable across different stakeholder types

### Performance Expectations
- Report generation must complete within 2 minutes for individual student reports
- Batch processing must handle an entire school (1,000+ students) in under 30 minutes
- System must efficiently process 5+ years of historical student data
- Memory usage must remain reasonable even when processing district-wide datasets

### Integration Points
- Standard connectors for major student information systems
- Import capabilities for assessment data from various testing platforms
- Integration with curriculum and standards frameworks
- Export capabilities to PDF, secure web formats, and data exchange standards

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain absolute compliance with FERPA and other educational privacy regulations
- Must handle diverse grading systems and assessment frameworks
- Must accommodate academic year transitions and student progression
- Must support various educational models (traditional, standards-based, competency-based)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

   - Map performance to curriculum standards
   - Identify learning gaps and opportunities
   - Generate appropriate interventions based on performance patterns

3. **Audience-Specific Reporting**

   - Maintain audit trails for all data access

5. **Longitudinal Analysis**
   - Track student progress over multiple years
   - Identify long-term trends and patterns
   - Support cohort analysis and comparison
   - Enable program effectiveness evaluation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify

1. **Data Integration Reliability**
   - Verify that connectors can accurately extract student data
   - Test handling of diverse grading scales and assessment types
   - Verify appropriate merging of data from multiple sources
   - Confirm proper handling of historical data and academic year transitions

2. **Analytical Accuracy**
   - Verify all educational metrics against manually calculated values
   - Test performance classification and grouping logic
   - Verify standards alignment and mapping
   - Confirm appropriate handling of missing assessment data

3. **Multi-Audience Templating**
   - Verify that each audience type receives appropriate content
   - Test language adaptation for different stakeholders
   - Confirm proper hiding/showing of sensitive information
   - Verify visualization appropriateness for each audience

   - Test performance with different dataset sizes
   - Verify appropriate handling of edge cases (new students, transfers, etc.)

### Critical User Scenarios

1. Generating individual student progress reports for parent-teacher conferences
2. Creating classroom-level reports for teachers highlighting intervention needs
3. Producing district-level performance reports for educational officials
4. Generating year-over-year progress analysis for school improvement planning
5. Creating standards mastery reports aligned with curriculum frameworks

### Performance Benchmarks

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements

- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
