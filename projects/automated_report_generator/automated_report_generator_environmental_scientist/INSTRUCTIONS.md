# Environmental Compliance Monitoring System

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for environmental scientists who need to process and report on environmental monitoring data for regulatory compliance.

## Overview

The Environmental Compliance Monitoring System is a Python library that processes data from field stations and environmental sensors to generate comprehensive compliance reports for regulatory agencies. It efficiently handles large volumes of time-series environmental data, automatically identifies threshold violations, correlates measurements with contextual factors, and produces geospatial visualizations that highlight environmental impacts over time.

## Persona Description

Raj monitors environmental data from multiple field stations and needs to generate compliance reports for regulatory agencies. His primary goal is to efficiently process large volumes of time-series data and highlight compliance violations with appropriate context.

## Key Requirements

1. **Field sensor data integration with geographical information system (GIS) mapping**
   - Critical for Raj because environmental monitoring relies on distributed sensor networks across diverse geographical locations
   - Must support common environmental sensor data formats and protocols
   - Should handle GPS/location data and integrate with GIS frameworks
   - Must process and normalize data from heterogeneous sensor types (air quality, water quality, soil, weather, etc.)
   - Should support both real-time data streams and batch uploads from field stations

2. **Regulatory threshold monitoring with automatic violation flagging**
   - Essential for Raj to quickly identify potential compliance issues across thousands of measurements
   - Must maintain an up-to-date database of applicable environmental regulations and thresholds
   - Should automatically flag measurements that exceed regulatory limits
   - Must calculate compliance statistics and violation frequencies
   - Should support complex compliance rules with multiple parameters and conditional logic

3. **Weather condition correlation analysis for environmental measurements**
   - Important for Raj to provide context for measurements and explain anomalies
   - Must retrieve and incorporate weather data from reliable sources
   - Should calculate correlations between environmental measurements and weather conditions
   - Must identify and account for weather-driven anomalies
   - Should generate visualizations that illustrate weather impacts on environmental parameters

4. **Chain-of-custody documentation for sampling data**
   - Vital for Raj to maintain the legal validity of environmental data
   - Must track the complete history of each sample from collection to analysis
   - Should generate compliant chain-of-custody documentation
   - Must record all handling, preservation, and analytical methods
   - Should flag potential procedural violations that could invalidate samples

5. **Geospatial visualization of environmental impacts over time**
   - Necessary for Raj to communicate spatial patterns and temporal trends effectively
   - Must generate maps showing measurement distributions across monitoring locations
   - Should create time-series animations showing changes in environmental parameters
   - Must support various visualization types (heatmaps, contours, graduated symbols)
   - Should detect and highlight spatial clusters of elevated measurements

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All sensor data integration components must be testable with synthetic environmental datasets
- Compliance threshold validation must be verifiable against reference regulatory limits
- Weather correlation algorithms must be testable with controlled weather/measurement pairs
- Chain-of-custody validation must be testable against regulatory requirements
- Geospatial visualization generation must be verifiable with known environmental scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Must process data from 500+ monitoring stations with 10+ parameters each in under 30 minutes
- Compliance analysis should complete for 1 million measurements in under 15 minutes
- Geospatial processing should handle 10,000+ location points efficiently
- System should scale linearly with data volume up to reasonable environmental monitoring limits
- Historical analysis should efficiently process 10+ years of environmental data

### Integration Points

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain data precision and accuracy to meet scientific and regulatory requirements
- All operations involving regulated parameters must be fully auditable
- Processing must be optimized for large time-series datasets with spatial components
- Must support operation in remote locations with intermittent connectivity
- All generated reports must comply with relevant regulatory formats and requirements
- System must be adaptable to evolving environmental regulations without code modifications

To set up this project:

1. Initialize a new Python library project:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
   ```
   uv run python examples/generate_compliance_report.py
   ```

The implementation should focus on creating a reliable, scalable system for environmental data management that meets both scientific and regulatory requirements while providing meaningful insights into environmental conditions and compliance status.
