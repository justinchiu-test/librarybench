# Environmental Compliance Reporting System

A specialized automated report generation framework for environmental scientists to process field sensor data and generate regulatory compliance reports with geospatial analysis.

## Overview

The Environmental Compliance Reporting System is a Python-based library designed to automate the generation of environmental monitoring reports for regulatory agencies. It collects and processes time-series data from field sensors, integrates with geographical information systems, identifies compliance violations, and produces comprehensive reports that provide appropriate context for environmental measurements.

## Persona Description

Raj monitors environmental data from multiple field stations and needs to generate compliance reports for regulatory agencies. His primary goal is to efficiently process large volumes of time-series data and highlight compliance violations with appropriate context.

## Key Requirements

1. **Field Sensor Data Integration**: Implement connectors for environmental monitoring equipment that integrate sensor data with geographical information system (GIS) mapping.
   - *Critical for Raj because*: Environmental data is inherently geospatial, and the significance of measurements can only be properly understood when placed in geographical context, allowing for identification of patterns, gradients, and potential contamination sources.

2. **Regulatory Threshold Monitoring**: Develop a comprehensive threshold monitoring system that automatically identifies and flags violations of environmental regulations.
   - *Critical for Raj because*: Environmental compliance is governed by complex, multi-parameter thresholds that vary by jurisdiction and site type, making manual monitoring practically impossible across numerous measurement points.

3. **Weather Correlation Analysis**: Create analytical tools that correlate environmental measurements with weather conditions to provide context for anomalous readings.
   - *Critical for Raj because*: Many environmental parameters are significantly influenced by weather events, and distinguishing between natural variations and actual pollution events requires understanding these relationships.

4. **Chain-of-Custody Documentation**: Implement a system to maintain complete documentation of sample collection, handling, and analysis to support the legal defensibility of environmental data.
   - *Critical for Raj because*: Environmental compliance often has legal implications, and proving that samples were properly collected, transported, and analyzed is essential for regulatory acceptance of monitoring results.

5. **Geospatial Visualization**: Build sophisticated mapping and visualization capabilities that show environmental impacts and changes over time across monitoring locations.
   - *Critical for Raj because*: Communicating complex environmental data to regulators and stakeholders requires clear visual representations that show spatial relationships and temporal changes that would be difficult to understand from tabular data alone.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All sensor data connectors must be testable with synthetic environmental datasets
- Threshold monitoring must be verifiable against known regulatory standards
- Weather correlation algorithms must be testable with historical weather and environmental data
- Chain-of-custody tracking must be verifiable for sample integrity

### Performance Expectations
- System must efficiently process data from 100+ monitoring stations simultaneously
- Time-series analysis must handle datasets spanning multiple years (millions of data points)

### Integration Points
- Standard connectors for environmental monitoring equipment and data loggers

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain data integrity throughout the processing pipeline

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report

  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
