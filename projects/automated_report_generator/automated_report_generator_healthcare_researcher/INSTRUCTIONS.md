# Clinical Research Report Generator

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for healthcare researchers who need to generate standardized patient outcome reports while maintaining strict privacy compliance.

## Overview

The Clinical Research Report Generator is a Python library that transforms complex medical data into accessible, standardized reports for both medical professionals and non-technical stakeholders. It maintains strict privacy compliance while providing powerful statistical analysis and visualization capabilities specifically tailored for clinical research data.

   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
   ```
   uv run python examples/generate_clinical_report.py
   ```

The implementation should prioritize patient privacy and clinical accuracy while making complex medical data accessible to appropriate audiences. The core architecture should support the specific requirements of clinical research while maintaining flexibility for different study designs and data types.
