# Marketing Campaign Performance Reporter

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for marketing managers who need to compile and analyze performance metrics from various digital marketing platforms.

## Overview

The Marketing Campaign Performance Reporter is a Python library that automates the collection, analysis, and visualization of marketing metrics across multiple platforms into cohesive, story-driven reports. It eliminates manual data aggregation while providing insightful visualizations and KPI tracking that help demonstrate campaign effectiveness to clients and leadership.

## Persona Description

Diego manages digital marketing campaigns and needs to compile performance metrics from various platforms into cohesive reports for clients and leadership. His goal is to create visually engaging reports that tell a story about campaign performance with minimal manual data processing.

## Key Requirements

1. **Direct API integrations with major advertising and social media platforms**

   - Must support authenticated API connections with proper rate limiting and error handling
   - Should handle platform-specific metrics and normalize them for cross-platform comparison
   - Must stay updated with changing API specifications from marketing platforms

2. **Custom marketing KPI calculations and attribution modeling**
   - Essential for Diego to demonstrate the true business impact of marketing efforts
   - Must calculate derived metrics like Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), Return On Ad Spend (ROAS), and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
   - Should support multiple attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch, etc.)
   - Must allow for custom conversion value assignments based on client-specific business rules

3. **Dynamic creative asset embedding that showcases actual ad content within reports**
   - Important for Diego to provide visual context for performance metrics
   - Must retrieve and store creative assets (images, ad copy) from marketing platforms
   - Should display creatives alongside their respective performance metrics
   - Must handle different creative formats and sizes in a consistent layout
   - Should support A/B test comparison views of different creatives

4. **Competitive benchmark integration showing performance against industry standards**
   - Crucial for Diego to contextualize campaign performance for clients
   - Must incorporate industry benchmark data from reliable sources
   - Should show percentile rankings of campaign metrics against industry averages
   - Must update benchmark data regularly to maintain relevance
   - Should support customizable peer group selection for more relevant comparisons

5. **Interactive conversion funnel visualizations that clients can explore**
   - Vital for Diego to demonstrate the customer journey and identify optimization opportunities
   - Must visualize multi-step conversion processes across different channels
   - Should highlight drop-off points and conversion rates between funnel stages
   - Must support drill-down capabilities for detailed stage analysis
   - Should calculate funnel health metrics and trend analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All API integrations must be testable with mock responses
- Data transformation and KPI calculations must be verifiable with known inputs/outputs
- Visualization generation must be testable without requiring manual inspection
- Attribution models must be testable with controlled customer journey data
- Performance metrics must be measurable under various data volume scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Must handle data from at least 10 different marketing platforms simultaneously
- API data collection should process 6+ months of historical data in under 10 minutes
- KPI calculations should complete for complex attribution models in under 30 seconds
- Report generation including all visualizations should complete in under 2 minutes
- Must support incremental updates for daily reporting without full data reprocessing

### Integration Points
- Authenticated API connections to major marketing platforms (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Industry benchmark data sources with regular update mechanisms
- Asset management system for creative content storage and retrieval
- Email and notification systems for automated report distribution
- Data warehouse/lake integration for historical data persistence

### Key Constraints
- Must handle API rate limits without failing report generation
- All operations must be non-blocking to allow for parallel processing
- Creative assets must be stored in compliance with relevant copyright and privacy regulations
- Benchmark data must be anonymized and aggregated as required by data providers
- Processing must be optimized for both daily quick updates and comprehensive monthly reports

## Core Functionality

The library should implement the following core components:

1. **Marketing Platform Connector Framework**
   - Extensible architecture for connecting to various marketing APIs
   - Authentication handling for different OAuth flows and API keys
   - Rate limit management and retry mechanisms

   - Incremental data fetching to optimize API usage

2. **Marketing Analytics Engine**
   - Calculation engine for marketing KPIs and derived metrics
   - Attribution modeling framework supporting multiple models
   - Trend analysis and forecasting capabilities
   - Anomaly detection for metric fluctuations
   - Campaign comparison and optimization suggestions

3. **Creative Asset Management**
   - Asset retrieval from marketing platforms
   - Local storage with efficient organization
   - Metadata tagging for easy retrieval
   - Format conversion for consistent display
   - Version tracking for creative iterations

4. **Benchmark Analysis System**
   - Industry data integration and categorization
   - Percentile calculation and comparison logic
   - Peer group configuration and customization
   - Trend tracking against benchmarks over time
   - Statistical significance testing for performance differences

5. **Funnel Visualization Engine**
   - Multi-stage funnel definition and configuration
   - Cross-channel journey mapping
   - Conversion rate calculation between stages
   - Drop-off analysis and opportunity identification
   - Time-series comparison of funnel performance

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate data retrieval from all supported marketing platforms
- Correct calculation of all marketing KPIs and attribution models
- Proper normalization of metrics across different platforms
- Accurate benchmark comparisons and percentile rankings
- Correct funnel visualization and conversion rate calculations
- Proper embedding and display of creative assets
- Appropriate handling of missing or incomplete data

### Critical User Scenarios

   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
   ```
   uv run python examples/generate_campaign_report.py
   ```

The implementation should focus on creating a flexible, extensible framework that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape of marketing platforms while providing consistent, insightful analysis capabilities.
