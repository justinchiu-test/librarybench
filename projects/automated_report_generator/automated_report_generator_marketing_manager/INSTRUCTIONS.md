# Marketing Campaign Performance Reporter

A specialized adaptation of PyReport designed for marketing professionals who need to compile, analyze, and visualize campaign performance data from multiple platforms into cohesive, visually engaging reports.

## Overview

The Marketing Campaign Performance Reporter is a Python library that automates the collection and integration of marketing metrics from various advertising and social media platforms, transforms raw data into meaningful marketing KPIs, and generates visually compelling reports that communicate campaign performance effectively to clients and leadership.

## Persona Description

Diego manages digital marketing campaigns and needs to compile performance metrics from various platforms into cohesive reports for clients and leadership. His goal is to create visually engaging reports that tell a story about campaign performance with minimal manual data processing.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Platform API Integrations**: Implement direct API connectors for major advertising and social media platforms (Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.) with authentication management and rate limiting support.
   * *Importance*: Diego currently wastes hours manually exporting data from each platform; integrated API connections eliminate this tedious process and ensure real-time data accuracy across all marketing channels.

2. **Marketing KPI Calculation Engine**: Develop customizable calculation modules for marketing-specific metrics including attribution modeling, conversion path analysis, ROI calculations, and cross-channel performance comparisons.
   * *Importance*: Raw platform data requires significant transformation to become meaningful marketing insights; automated KPI calculations standardize this analysis across campaigns and eliminate inconsistencies in metric definitions.

3. **Creative Asset Embedding**: Create a system to dynamically embed actual ad creative assets within reports, with support for images, videos, and interactive elements that provide visual context for performance metrics.
   * *Importance*: Clients struggle to connect performance data to specific creative assets; embedding the actual ad content provides immediate visual context and helps explain performance variations across different creative approaches.

4. **Competitive Benchmark Integration**: Develop a benchmarking system that compares campaign performance against industry standards, historical performance, and competitor metrics where available.
   * *Importance*: Performance metrics in isolation lack context; competitive benchmarking provides essential reference points that help clients understand relative performance and justify marketing investments.

5. **Interactive Conversion Funnel Visualization**: Implement dynamic conversion funnel visualizations that clients can explore, showing user progression through marketing touchpoints with drop-off rates and conversion metrics at each stage.
   * *Importance*: Understanding the full customer journey is critical for optimizing campaigns; interactive funnels allow Diego's clients to identify friction points and opportunities for improving conversion rates through the entire marketing process.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- API connectors must support mock responses for testing without live platform access
- All KPI calculation functions must be unit testable with predefined datasets
- Visualization rendering must support headless testing with output validation
- End-to-end testing capability for the entire report generation pipeline with sample data

### Performance Expectations
- Must process campaign data from at least 5 different platforms in under 2 minutes
- Report generation including all visualizations must complete in under 3 minutes
- Must handle at least 12 months of historical campaign data for trend analysis
- API connections should utilize parallel processing where possible to minimize total data collection time

### Integration Points
- Authentication and API integration with major marketing platforms
- Image and video asset retrieval from content management systems and ad platforms
- Support for importing client-provided benchmarks and target KPIs
- Output formats compatible with digital presentation (HTML, PDF, interactive web)

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain data privacy and comply with platform terms of service for API usage
- Creative assets must be rendered at appropriate quality while keeping report file sizes manageable
- Interactive elements must be compatible with standard PDF readers or provide alternative static versions
- Should minimize API calls to avoid rate limiting issues with marketing platforms

## Core Functionality

The Marketing Campaign Performance Reporter must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Data Collection System**
   - Platform-specific API connectors with proper authentication
   - Data normalization across different marketing platform formats
   - Historical data retrieval and storage for trend analysis
   - Support for both scheduled and on-demand data collection

2. **Marketing Analytics Engine**
   - Cross-platform performance aggregation
   - Custom marketing KPI calculations and attribution modeling
   - Audience segmentation analysis
   - ROI and ROAS calculations with configurable attribution windows

3. **Creative Performance Analysis**
   - Asset-level performance metrics correlation
   - A/B testing results visualization
   - Creative element categorization and tagging
   - Performance segmentation by creative attributes

4. **Benchmark Management**
   - Industry standard benchmark integration
   - Historical performance comparison
   - Target vs. actual performance tracking
   - Competitive intelligence integration where available

5. **Report Generation System**
   - Templatized reports for different client needs
   - Dynamic data visualization generation
   - Narrative insight generation based on data patterns
   - Multi-format export with interactive and static options

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate data collection from each supported marketing platform
- Correct calculation of all marketing KPIs and attribution models
- Proper embedding and rendering of creative assets
- Accurate benchmark comparisons against industry standards
- Interactive elements function correctly in supported output formats

### Critical User Scenarios
- Monthly campaign performance reporting for clients
- Mid-campaign optimization analysis
- Campaign wrap-up reports with ROI analysis
- Cross-channel comparison reports
- Creative performance analysis and recommendations

### Performance Benchmarks
- API data collection from 7 major platforms should complete in under 3 minutes
- Report generation with up to 20 visualizations should complete in under 2 minutes
- System should process campaign data volume equivalent to $1M monthly ad spend across platforms
- Memory usage should not exceed 1GB during report generation process
- Interactive elements should respond in under 250ms when used in web output format

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of API rate limits and temporary platform outages
- Management of missing data for specific date ranges or metrics
- Processing of campaigns with unusually large numbers of creative assets
- Proper scale adaptation for metrics with extreme outliers
- Graceful degradation when interactive features aren't supported in output format

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all API connectors and data processors
- 100% coverage of KPI calculation functions
- All error handling paths must be tested for each API integration
- Complete testing of visualization rendering for all supported creative asset types
- Full test coverage of interactive element functionality

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Campaign data can be automatically collected from at least 5 major marketing platforms without manual intervention
2. All standard marketing KPIs are calculated correctly and match manual verification
3. Creative assets are properly embedded in reports with corresponding performance metrics
4. Campaign performance can be accurately benchmarked against industry standards and historical data
5. Interactive conversion funnels correctly display user journey data with accurate metrics at each stage
6. The entire report generation process from data collection to final output can be completed in under 10 minutes
7. Reports effectively communicate performance insights that inform marketing optimization decisions
8. The system can be easily configured for new clients with different platform combinations
9. Generated reports receive positive feedback from both clients and internal leadership
10. The solution reduces report preparation time by at least 80% compared to manual methods
