# Impact Storytelling Report Generator

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for non-profit directors who need to create compelling impact reports for donors and grant applications.

## Overview

The Impact Storytelling Report Generator is a Python library that transforms program data into persuasive, evidence-based narratives for non-profit stakeholders. It integrates beneficiary tracking data, impact metrics, financial allocation information, and qualitative elements to create compelling reports that demonstrate organizational effectiveness while meeting specific funder requirements.

## Persona Description

Elena runs a non-profit organization and needs to create impact reports for donors and grant applications. Her primary goal is to translate program activities into compelling narratives with supporting data that demonstrates the organization's effectiveness.

## Key Requirements

1. **Beneficiary tracking system integration for demographic and service data**
   - Critical for Elena because understanding who is being served and how is foundational to demonstrating impact
   - Must connect with common CRM and case management systems used by non-profits
   - Should aggregate and anonymize sensitive beneficiary information appropriately
   - Must support demographic analysis with intersectional factors
   - Should track service delivery, program participation, and outcomes data

2. **Impact metric calculations based on program theory models**
   - Essential for Elena to translate activities into measurable outcomes and impact
   - Must implement logic models connecting inputs and activities to outputs and outcomes
   - Should calculate standardized impact metrics (SROI, cost per outcome, etc.)
   - Must support customizable impact frameworks for different program types
   - Should enable comparison against sector benchmarks when available

3. **Donation allocation visualization showing how funds are utilized**
   - Important for Elena to demonstrate financial stewardship to donors
   - Must connect with accounting/financial systems to extract accurate allocation data
   - Should create clear visualizations of program vs. administrative spending
   - Must track restricted and unrestricted fund utilization
   - Should illustrate the connection between donations and specific outcomes

4. **Grant-specific templating that matches individual funder requirements**
   - Necessary for Elena to efficiently create tailored applications for different funders
   - Must support customizable templates that match specific grant application formats
   - Should auto-populate common information across different applications
   - Must enforce character/word limits and other funder-specific constraints
   - Should highlight alignment between programs and funder priorities

5. **Storytelling elements that integrate case studies and testimonials with quantitative data**
   - Vital for Elena to create emotional connection while providing evidence of impact
   - Must organize and tag qualitative data (testimonials, stories, photos) for appropriate use
   - Should integrate narrative elements with supporting quantitative evidence
   - Must ensure privacy and consent compliance for all personal stories
   - Should balance emotional appeal with data-driven credibility

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All data integration components must be testable with synthetic beneficiary data
- Impact metric calculations must be verifiable against manual calculations
- Financial allocation analysis must be testable with standard accounting data
- Template generation must be verifiable against funder requirements
- Storytelling integration must be testable for appropriate placement and context

### Performance Expectations
- Must process data for 10,000+ beneficiaries in under 10 minutes
- Impact metric calculations should complete for 50+ program outcomes in under 5 minutes
- Report generation including all visualizations should complete in under 3 minutes
- System should scale to support organizations of all sizes, from small local nonprofits to international NGOs
- Must optimize storage for efficient handling of qualitative assets (testimonials, photos, videos)

### Integration Points
- Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) systems commonly used by nonprofits
- Case management and program tracking software
- Financial/accounting systems for donation and expense data
- Document management systems for qualitative assets
- Grant management platforms
- Impact measurement frameworks and standards
- Communications platforms for report distribution

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain privacy and confidentiality of beneficiary information
- All operations involving personal stories must respect consent parameters
- Report generation must be fully automated with no UI dependencies
- Must be configurable for different nonprofit sectors (health, education, humanitarian, etc.)
- Processing must be optimized to run on modest nonprofit IT infrastructure
- System must accommodate both quantitative and qualitative data types

## Core Functionality

The library should implement the following core components:

1. **Beneficiary Data Management**
   - CRM and case management system connectors
   - Demographic analysis and segmentation
   - Service delivery tracking and aggregation
   - Outcome measurement and attribution
   - Privacy-preserving aggregation and anonymization

2. **Impact Measurement Framework**
   - Logic model implementation and validation
   - Standardized impact metric calculation
   - Custom outcome tracking and evaluation
   - Benchmark comparison and context
   - Longitudinal impact analysis

3. **Financial Analysis System**
   - Financial data extraction and categorization
   - Program cost and allocation analysis
   - Donation tracking and utilization reporting
   - Grant fund management and compliance
   - Efficiency and effectiveness metrics

4. **Funder-Specific Reporting**
   - Template management and versioning
   - Dynamic content population from data sources
   - Constraint validation and enforcement
   - Funder priority alignment analysis
   - Application history and tracking

5. **Narrative Integration Engine**
   - Qualitative asset management and tagging
   - Context-appropriate story selection
   - Data-narrative linking and validation
   - Consent tracking and management
   - Narrative effectiveness analysis

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate integration and processing of beneficiary program data
- Correct calculation of impact metrics according to established methodologies
- Proper analysis and visualization of financial allocations
- Appropriate application of funder-specific templates and constraints
- Effective integration of qualitative elements with quantitative data
- Preservation of privacy and adherence to consent parameters
- Generation of compelling, evidence-based narratives

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating an annual impact report for major donors and board members
- Generating a specific grant application matching a funder's template requirements
- Analyzing program effectiveness across multiple service areas and demographics
- Demonstrating financial stewardship and fund utilization to stakeholders
- Showcasing individual success stories alongside aggregate impact metrics
- Preparing specialized reports for different stakeholder groups
- Tracking longitudinal impact of programs over multiple years

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process data for 10,000+ beneficiaries in under 10 minutes

   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
   ```
   uv run python examples/generate_impact_report.py
   ```

The implementation should focus on creating a flexible system that helps nonprofit organizations effectively communicate their impact through a combination of compelling narratives and solid data. The system should be adaptable to different sectors and organization sizes while maintaining ease of use.
