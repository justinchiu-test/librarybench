# Manufacturing Operations Intelligence System

A specialized adaptation of PyReport designed for operations directors who need real-time production monitoring, efficiency metrics analysis, and targeted distribution of operational insights across different manufacturing teams.

## Overview

The Manufacturing Operations Intelligence System is a Python library that creates a complete data pipeline for manufacturing operations reporting. It collects real-time production data, applies anomaly detection algorithms, performs shift-based comparative analysis, and generates targeted reports for different operational teams, enabling quick identification of bottlenecks and quality control issues.

## Persona Description

Marcus oversees manufacturing operations and needs daily production reports that highlight efficiency metrics and quality control issues. His goal is to identify operational bottlenecks quickly and distribute targeted reports to different departments based on their specific responsibilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Real-time Production Data Collection**: Implement a system for gathering data from IoT devices, production line sensors, and manufacturing execution systems with support for various industrial protocols and data formats.
   * *Importance*: Manufacturing issues require immediate attention; real-time data collection provides Marcus with up-to-the-minute visibility into production line status, allowing his team to respond to critical issues before they cascade into larger problems.

2. **Automated Anomaly Detection**: Develop algorithms that automatically identify deviations from normal operations based on historical patterns, statistical thresholds, and machine learning models trained on past production data.
   * *Importance*: In complex manufacturing environments with thousands of data points, manual monitoring is impossible; automated anomaly detection immediately highlights potential issues and prevents quality problems from reaching customers.

3. **Shift Comparison Analytics**: Create analysis tools that compare performance metrics across different shifts while accounting for variables such as staffing levels, equipment configurations, and production mix.
   * *Importance*: Performance variations between shifts often indicate process inconsistencies or training gaps; normalized shift comparison provides fair, accurate benchmarking that helps identify best practices and standardize operations.

4. **Role-Based Report Distribution**: Implement a system that automatically generates customized report content for different operational teams (maintenance, quality control, production, logistics) based on their specific responsibilities and KPIs.
   * *Importance*: Each department needs different operational metrics; role-based distribution ensures team members receive precisely the information they need to perform their functions without wading through irrelevant data.

5. **Root Cause Analysis Templates**: Develop structured templates for root cause analysis that automatically link quality issues to specific production factors, enabling systematic problem investigation and resolution tracking.
   * *Importance*: Effective problem-solving requires structured analysis; templated root cause investigation ensures consistent problem-solving methodology across all manufacturing issues and facilitates knowledge sharing between teams.
