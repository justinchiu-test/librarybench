# Manufacturing Operations Report Generator

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for operations directors who need to monitor and analyze manufacturing production metrics and quality control issues.

## Overview

The Manufacturing Operations Report Generator is a Python library that creates real-time and daily production reports highlighting efficiency metrics and quality control issues. It helps identify operational bottlenecks quickly and distributes targeted information to different departments based on their specific responsibilities within the manufacturing organization.

## Persona Description

Marcus oversees manufacturing operations and needs daily production reports that highlight efficiency metrics and quality control issues. His goal is to identify operational bottlenecks quickly and distribute targeted reports to different departments based on their specific responsibilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Real-time data collection from IoT devices and production line sensors**
   - Critical for Marcus because manufacturing operations generate continuous streams of operational data
   - Must support common industrial protocols (MQTT, OPC UA, Modbus) for sensor communication
   - Should handle high-frequency data collection without performance degradation
   - Must implement efficient data storage with appropriate time-series optimization
   - Should detect and manage connectivity issues with sensors automatically

2. **Anomaly detection algorithms that automatically highlight deviations from normal operations**
   - Essential for Marcus to quickly identify problems without manually reviewing all metrics
   - Must implement statistical and machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Should adapt to seasonal patterns and production schedules
   - Must provide clear explanation of why an event was flagged as anomalous
   - Should minimize false positives while still capturing true operational issues

3. **Shift comparison tools that account for staffing and equipment variables**
   - Important for Marcus to fairly evaluate productivity across different operational contexts
   - Must normalize metrics based on staffing levels, equipment types, and product mix
   - Should identify significant performance differences between comparable shifts
   - Must account for known factors like maintenance schedules and supply chain disruptions
   - Should track individual and team performance patterns over time

4. **Role-based report distribution that customizes content for different operational teams**
   - Necessary for Marcus to ensure each department receives relevant, actionable information
   - Must support multiple report templates based on recipient roles
   - Should automatically distribute reports via appropriate channels (email, dashboard, etc.)
   - Must control access to sensitive operational or personnel data
   - Should track report delivery and consumption metrics

5. **Root cause analysis templates that link quality issues to specific production factors**
   - Vital for Marcus to systematically address recurring production problems
   - Must correlate quality defects with process parameters and operational events
   - Should implement structured problem-solving methodologies (5-Why, Fishbone diagrams)
   - Must track remediation efforts and effectiveness over time
   - Should identify systemic issues versus one-time anomalies

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All data collection modules must be testable with simulated sensor data
- Anomaly detection algorithms must be verifiable with labeled test datasets

### Performance Expectations
- Must handle data streams from 1000+ sensors with sub-second latency
- Anomaly detection should process 24 hours of operational data in under 5 minutes
- Report generation should complete in under 2 minutes for standard daily reports

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
