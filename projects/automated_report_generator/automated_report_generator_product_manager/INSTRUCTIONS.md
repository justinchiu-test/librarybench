# Product Analytics Insight Engine

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for product managers who need to create feature adoption and user engagement reports for executive teams.

## Overview

The Product Analytics Insight Engine is a Python library that connects product usage data with business outcomes to inform strategic product decisions. It integrates with analytics platforms, performs cohort analysis, calculates revenue impact, visualizes A/B test results, and maps user journeys through product experiences - all designed to help product managers communicate the business value of product features and user engagement.

   - Must analyze A/B test results with appropriate statistical rigor
   - Should visualize test outcomes with confidence intervals and significance indicators
   - Must support complex test designs (multivariate, sequential, etc.)
   - Should calculate business impact of implementing successful experiments

5. **User journey mapping that shows progression through product experiences**
   - Necessary for Alex to understand the complete user experience and identify optimization opportunities
   - Must reconstruct and visualize user paths through product features
   - Should identify common paths, drop-off points, and conversion funnels
   - Must segment journeys by user type and success outcomes
   - Should highlight opportunities for journey optimization

   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
   ```
   uv run python examples/generate_product_report.py
   ```

The implementation should focus on creating a flexible, scalable system that helps product managers extract meaningful insights from complex product analytics data and effectively communicate those insights to business stakeholders. The system should emphasize the connection between product usage and business outcomes while providing rigorous analysis to support product decisions.
