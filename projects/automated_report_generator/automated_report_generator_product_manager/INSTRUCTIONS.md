# Product Analytics Insights Engine

A specialized adaptation of PyReport designed for product managers who need to transform usage data into strategic insights that connect product engagement with business outcomes to inform strategic decisions.

## Overview

The Product Analytics Insights Engine is a Python library that helps product managers aggregate, analyze, and visualize product usage data to drive strategic decisions. It connects with analytics platforms, performs cohort analysis, calculates revenue impact, visualizes experiment results, and maps user journeys to provide a comprehensive view of product performance and business impact.

## Persona Description

Alex manages product development and needs to create feature adoption and user engagement reports for the executive team. His primary goal is to connect product usage data with business outcomes to inform strategic decisions.

## Key Requirements

1. **Product Analytics Platform Integration**: Develop connectors for major product analytics tools (Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics, etc.) that normalize data across platforms and support historical data analysis.
   * *Importance*: Product data is scattered across specialized analytics tools; automated integration eliminates manual data compilation, creates a single source of truth for product metrics, and enables Alex to track complete user behavior rather than platform-limited snapshots.

2. **Feature Cohort Analysis**: Implement segmentation algorithms that analyze adoption patterns across different user segments, revealing how various user groups interact with product features based on demographics, behaviors, or acquisition channels.
   * *Importance*: Different user segments adopt features differently; cohort analysis uncovers which features resonate with high-value segments, identifies adoption barriers for specific groups, and helps Alex prioritize development resources toward features with the strongest segment-specific impact.

3. **Revenue Impact Calculation**: Create a framework for linking feature usage to business metrics such as conversion rates, subscription upgrades, retention improvements, or direct revenue generation.
   * *Importance*: Feature development requires business justification; revenue impact calculations transform usage statistics into financial outcomes, enabling Alex to demonstrate ROI to executives, secure resources for high-impact initiatives, and deprioritize features with minimal business value despite high engagement.

4. **A/B Test Result Visualization**: Develop tools for analyzing and visualizing experiment results, including statistical significance validation, segment-specific impacts, and unexpected secondary effects.
   * *Importance*: Data-driven product decisions require experimental validation; robust test visualization helps Alex identify winning variants, understand exactly why they outperform alternatives, and detect subtle interaction effects that might be missed in basic conversion metrics.

5. **User Journey Mapping**: Implement pathway analysis that reveals how users progress through product experiences, identifying common paths, drop-off points, conversion funnels, and feature discovery patterns.
   * *Importance*: Individual feature metrics miss the bigger user experience picture; journey mapping shows how features connect in actual usage, helps identify friction points between features, reveals unexpected usage patterns, and enables Alex to optimize critical paths that drive product success.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Analytics platform connectors must support mock responses for testing without live platforms

   - Retention and engagement correlation
   - Conversion funnel impact assessment
   - Lifetime value calculation by feature usage

4. **Experimentation Framework**
   - Statistical significance calculation
   - Segment-specific impact analysis
   - Multi-variant test evaluation
   - Guardrail metric monitoring

5. **User Behavior Visualization**
   - Journey mapping and pathway analysis
   - Feature interaction network visualization
   - Temporal usage pattern detection
   - Retention and engagement visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate data collection from each supported analytics platform
- Correct segmentation and cohort analysis across user dimensions

- Strategic planning with feature impact analysis
- Executive presentation of product performance metrics
- A/B test analysis for feature optimization
- User experience improvement planning

### Performance Benchmarks
- Processing of 30 days of event data for 1 million users should complete in under 10 minutes
- Cohort analysis with 10 different segment dimensions should complete in under 5 minutes
- A/B test analysis with 5 variants should complete statistical validation in under 2 minutes
- User journey mapping should process 100,000 unique paths in under 3 minutes
- Report generation with interactive visualizations should complete in under 1 minute

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of data inconsistencies between analytics platforms
- Management of statistical edge cases with small sample sizes
- Processing of products with highly diverse user bases
- Adaptation to rapidly changing product features
- Appropriate handling of seasonality and external factors

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% code coverage for revenue impact calculations
- 100% coverage of statistical validation functions
- Complete testing of visualization generation for all analysis types
- Full verification of segment definition and cohort creation
- Comprehensive testing of data aggregation and normalization

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Product usage data is accurately collected and normalized from at least 3 different analytics platforms
2. Feature adoption patterns are clearly revealed across different user segments
3. Revenue impact is convincingly attributed to specific feature usage patterns
4. A/B test results are analyzed with proper statistical validation and segment breakdowns
5. User journeys through the product are clearly visualized with actionable insights
6. The system handles data volume from products with at least 1 million monthly active users
