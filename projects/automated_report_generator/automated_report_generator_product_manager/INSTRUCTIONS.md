# Product Analytics Insight Engine

A specialized automated report generation framework for product managers to create feature adoption and user engagement reports that connect product usage data with business outcomes.

## Overview

The Product Analytics Insight Engine is a Python-based library designed to transform product usage data into actionable business insights. It integrates with analytics platforms, processes user behavior data, identifies adoption patterns across user segments, calculates revenue impacts, analyzes A/B test results, and maps user journeys to provide a comprehensive view of product performance.

## Persona Description

Alex manages product development and needs to create feature adoption and user engagement reports for the executive team. His primary goal is to connect product usage data with business outcomes to inform strategic decisions.

## Key Requirements

1. **Analytics Platform Integration**: Implement connectors for popular product analytics platforms (Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics, etc.) to consolidate usage data.
   - *Critical for Alex because*: Product data often exists in multiple analytics tools, each capturing different aspects of user behavior, and manually extracting and reconciling this information across platforms is extremely time-consuming and error-prone.

2. **Cohort Analysis Framework**: Develop sophisticated cohort analysis capabilities that reveal adoption patterns across different user segments and identify which types of users are embracing specific features.
   - *Critical for Alex because*: Understanding how different user groups interact with the product is essential for targeted improvements, and identifying patterns across thousands of users requires automated analysis beyond manual capabilities.

3. **Revenue Impact Calculation**: Create a system that connects feature usage with business metrics to quantify the financial impact of product changes and feature adoption.
   - *Critical for Alex because*: Securing resources for product development requires demonstrating ROI to executives, and explicitly connecting feature usage to revenue metrics provides compelling evidence for investment decisions.

4. **A/B Test Result Visualization**: Build functionality to analyze experimental results, visualize differences between test variants, and clearly communicate statistical significance.
   - *Critical for Alex because*: Data-driven product decisions rely on properly interpreted A/B test results, and ensuring that experimental outcomes are correctly analyzed and clearly presented is crucial for making valid conclusions.

5. **User Journey Mapping**: Implement tools to track and visualize user progression through product experiences, identifying common paths, drop-off points, and conversion opportunities.
   - *Critical for Alex because*: Understanding the complete user journey reveals optimization opportunities that aren't visible when looking at isolated features, and mapping these journeys manually across thousands of users is practically impossible.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All analytics platform connectors must be testable with synthetic user behavior data
- Cohort analysis must be verifiable with sample user segments
- Revenue impact calculations must be testable with controlled financial scenarios
- A/B test analysis must be verifiable for statistical correctness

### Performance Expectations
- System must efficiently process data for 1,000,000+ users and events
- Cohort analysis must complete within 2 minutes for complex segmentation queries
- Report generation must complete within 5 minutes for comprehensive product reports
- Performance must remain consistent when analyzing months of historical user data

### Integration Points
- Standard connectors for popular product analytics platforms
- Import capabilities for user segment definitions
- Compatibility with financial reporting systems
- Export capabilities to PDF, interactive dashboards, and presentation formats

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain user privacy and data security
- Must handle varying data structures across analytics platforms
- Must support products with both free and paid user tiers
- Must accommodate rapid product iteration and changing feature sets

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

2. **User Segmentation and Cohort Analysis**
   - Define and analyze user cohorts based on behaviors and attributes
   - Track feature adoption across different segments
   - Identify patterns in user engagement over time
   - Compare behavior between different user types

3. **Business Impact Analysis**

   - Calculate confidence intervals and significance
   - Visualize performance differences between variants
   - Segment test results by user characteristics

5. **User Journey Tracking**
   - Map common paths through product experiences
   - Identify conversion funnels and drop-off points
   - Measure time-to-value for new users
   - Track progression through product "aha moments"

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
