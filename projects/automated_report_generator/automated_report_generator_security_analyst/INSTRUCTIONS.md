# Security Posture Analytics Platform

A specialized version of PyReport designed specifically for IT security analysts who need to generate comprehensive security posture reports for both executive leadership and technical teams.

## Overview

The Security Posture Analytics Platform is a Python library that transforms complex security data into actionable intelligence with appropriate detail levels for different audiences. It integrates data from various security tools, applies risk scoring algorithms, maps findings to compliance requirements, tracks remediation efforts, and adjusts report complexity based on the audience's technical knowledge.

## Persona Description

Jamal works in cybersecurity and needs to generate security posture reports for executive leadership and technical teams. His goal is to transform complex security data into actionable intelligence with appropriate detail levels for different audiences.

## Key Requirements

1. **Security tool integration (SIEM, vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence platforms)**
   - Critical for Jamal because security data is distributed across multiple specialized tools and platforms
   - Must support common security tools via APIs, data exports, and standard formats
   - Should normalize and correlate data from disparate security sources
   - Must handle large volumes of security events, alerts, and findings
   - Should implement secure authentication for accessing sensitive security systems

2. **Risk scoring algorithms that prioritize findings based on business impact**
   - Essential for Jamal to focus remediation efforts on vulnerabilities that pose the greatest organizational risk
   - Must implement industry-standard risk scoring frameworks (CVSS, OWASP Risk Rating, etc.)
   - Should incorporate business context for asset criticality and data sensitivity
   - Must account for mitigating controls and compensating factors
   - Should adapt scoring based on threat intelligence and exploit availability

3. **Compliance mapping that links security status to regulatory requirements**
   - Important for Jamal to demonstrate regulatory compliance to auditors and executives
   - Must maintain mappings between security controls and various compliance frameworks
   - Should track compliance status across multiple standards simultaneously
   - Must generate evidence packages for audit preparation
   - Should identify compliance gaps and prioritize remediation efforts

4. **Remediation tracking with historical vulnerability lifecycle analysis**
   - Vital for Jamal to demonstrate security improvement over time
   - Must track the complete lifecycle of identified vulnerabilities
   - Should calculate metrics like mean-time-to-remediate and vulnerability aging
   - Must associate remediation activities with specific findings
   - Should predict future remediation timelines based on historical patterns

5. **Technical detail toggling that adjusts report complexity based on the audience**
   - Necessary for Jamal to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
   - Must generate different report versions from the same underlying data
   - Should adapt terminology, visualizations, and technical depth by audience
   - Must include appropriate context and explanations based on recipient knowledge
   - Should support drill-down capabilities for detailed investigation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All security tool integrations must be testable with synthetic security data
- Risk scoring algorithms must be verifiable against reference calculations

- All security data access must be logged for audit purposes
- Processing must be optimized for large security datasets
- Must support air-gapped environments with limited connectivity
- All report distribution must include appropriate security controls
- System must adapt to evolving threat landscape and new vulnerability types

## Core Functionality

The library should implement the following core components:

1. **Security Data Integration Framework**

   - Data normalization and correlation engine
   - Incremental data synchronization
   - Query optimization for large security datasets
   - Data validation and integrity checking

2. **Risk Assessment Engine**
   - Standard and custom risk scoring implementations
   - Business context integration for risk calculation
   - Threat intelligence enrichment
   - Risk trend analysis and forecasting
   - Prioritization algorithms for remediation planning

3. **Compliance Management System**
   - Regulatory framework library and mapping
   - Control-to-requirement correlation
   - Evidence collection and organization
   - Gap analysis and remediation planning
   - Multi-framework status dashboard

4. **Vulnerability Lifecycle Tracking**
   - Finding state management and workflow
   - SLA monitoring and alerting
   - Remediation activity correlation
   - Historical performance metrics
   - Predictive analysis for remediation planning

5. **Audience-Targeted Reporting**
   - Template management for different stakeholders
   - Complexity adjustment based on audience
   - Dynamic content generation and filtering
   - Visualization adaptation by technical level
   - Terminology adjustment and context provision

   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Execute example scripts:
   ```
   uv run python examples/generate_security_report.py
   ```

The implementation should focus on creating a flexible, secure system that transforms complex security data into meaningful, actionable reports tailored to different stakeholder needs while maintaining appropriate security controls for the sensitive information being processed.
