# Security Posture Intelligence Platform

A specialized adaptation of PyReport designed for cybersecurity professionals who need to transform complex security data into actionable intelligence reports with appropriate detail levels for different audiences.

## Overview

The Security Posture Intelligence Platform is a Python library that automates the collection, analysis, and reporting of cybersecurity data. It integrates with security tools, performs risk scoring, maps findings to compliance requirements, tracks remediation progress, and generates audience-appropriate reports that translate technical security data into business-relevant insights.

## Persona Description

Jamal works in cybersecurity and needs to generate security posture reports for executive leadership and technical teams. His goal is to transform complex security data into actionable intelligence with appropriate detail levels for different audiences.

## Key Requirements

1. **Security Tool Integration**: Develop connectors for common security platforms (SIEM systems, vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence feeds) that normalize and correlate data from disparate sources into a unified security posture view.
   * *Importance*: Security data is scattered across multiple tools and formats; automated integration eliminates manual data compilation, ensures comprehensive visibility across the security landscape, and enables Jamal to provide complete security posture assessments rather than tool-specific snapshots.

2. **Risk Scoring Algorithms**: Create customizable risk assessment algorithms that prioritize security findings based on threat severity, asset value, exploitability, and potential business impact using configurable risk frameworks.
   * *Importance*: Organizations face thousands of potential security issues; intelligent risk scoring helps focus limited resources on the highest-impact vulnerabilities, transforming overwhelming security data into prioritized action plans that address the most significant business risks first.

3. **Compliance Requirement Mapping**: Implement a system that automatically maps security findings to specific regulatory requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.) and tracks compliance status across different frameworks.
   * *Importance*: Modern organizations must satisfy multiple compliance mandates; automated mapping shows exactly how security issues affect regulatory posture, helping Jamal demonstrate compliance status to auditors while focusing remediation efforts on gaps that affect multiple frameworks simultaneously.

4. **Remediation Lifecycle Tracking**: Develop tracking mechanisms that follow vulnerability lifecycles from discovery through remediation, with historical analysis of resolution times and effectiveness metrics.
   * *Importance*: Effective security requires closing vulnerability loops; lifecycle tracking provides accountability for remediation activities, helps identify systemic weaknesses in the resolution process, and enables Jamal to show progress trends that demonstrate security program maturity to leadership.

5. **Audience-Based Detail Adjustment**: Create reporting templates that automatically adjust technical depth, visualization complexity, and terminology based on the intended audience's technical expertise and role-specific concerns.
   * *Importance*: Security insights must be actionable for diverse stakeholders; audience-tailored reports ensure executives receive business-focused summaries while technical teams get detailed remediation guidance, allowing Jamal to communicate effectively across the organization without creating multiple manual reports.

## Technical Requirements

   - Gap analysis and remediation prioritization
   - Evidence collection and documentation
   - Audit preparation and response support

4. **Remediation Intelligence System**
   - Vulnerability lifecycle tracking
   - Resolution effectiveness measurement
   - Resource allocation optimization
   - Trend analysis for process improvement

5. **Adaptive Reporting Framework**
   - Audience profile configuration and management
   - Technical depth adjustment by recipient
   - Visualization selection based on data and audience
   - Terminology translation between technical and business language

## Testing Requirements
