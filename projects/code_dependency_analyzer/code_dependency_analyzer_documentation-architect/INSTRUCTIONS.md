# Documentation Dependency Mapper

## Overview
A documentation-oriented dependency analysis tool that helps technical writers understand code relationships to create accurate API documentation, integration guides, and architectural diagrams automatically from code structure.

## Persona Description
A technical writer creating comprehensive documentation for complex systems. They need to understand code relationships to document APIs and integration points accurately.

## Key Requirements
1. **Automatic API documentation generation with usage examples**: The tool must extract public APIs from modules, analyze their usage patterns across the codebase, and generate documentation with real-world examples drawn from actual code usage.

2. **Integration point identification between modules**: Critical for system documentation, the system must identify where modules interact, what data flows between them, and which APIs serve as integration boundaries, creating clear interface documentation.

3. **Sequence diagram generation from call chains**: Essential for understanding system behavior, the tool must trace function calls across modules to generate sequence diagrams showing how components interact during key operations.

4. **Documentation coverage analysis for public interfaces**: To ensure completeness, the system must identify all public APIs and assess their documentation status, highlighting undocumented functions, missing parameter descriptions, and incomplete examples.

5. **Cross-reference generation for related modules**: For comprehensive documentation, the tool must identify conceptually related modules, generate appropriate cross-references, and create navigation aids that help readers understand module relationships.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**: All documentation generation functions must be unit testable with sample code structures. Integration tests should verify output quality against known documentation standards.
- **Performance expectations**: Must analyze and document APIs for codebases with 10,000+ functions within 15 minutes. Diagram generation should complete in seconds for typical call chains.
- **Integration points**: Must integrate with docstring formats (NumPy, Google, Sphinx), diagram tools (PlantUML, Mermaid), and provide APIs for documentation pipeline integration.
- **Key constraints**: Must handle various documentation styles, work with partially documented code, and generate meaningful output even without docstrings.

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The analyzer must parse code to extract API signatures and relationships, analyze usage patterns to generate relevant examples, create various diagram types from dependency data, assess documentation coverage with detailed reports, and generate cross-referenced documentation structures. The system should support multiple output formats and integrate with existing documentation workflows.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate API extraction and signature documentation
  - Correct usage example generation from real code
  - Valid sequence diagram creation from call traces
  - Proper documentation coverage calculation
  - Accurate cross-reference generation

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Documenting a REST API framework with complex middleware
  - Creating integration guides for a plugin system
  - Generating sequence diagrams for authentication flows
  - Assessing documentation coverage for a public library
  - Building cross-referenced docs for a large application

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Extract APIs from 1,000 modules in under 60 seconds
  - Generate sequence diagrams for 100 call chains in under 30 seconds
  - Analyze documentation coverage for 10,000 functions in under 2 minutes
  - Create cross-references for 5,000 modules in under 90 seconds

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Code with no docstrings or comments
  - Dynamic APIs created at runtime
  - Circular import references in documentation
  - Mixed documentation formats in same project
  - Abstract base classes and protocols

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for documentation parsers
  - 100% coverage for diagram generation logic
  - Full coverage of coverage analysis algorithms
  - Integration tests for all supported doc formats

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
Clear metrics and outcomes that would indicate the implementation successfully meets this persona's needs:
- Generates documentation covering 95% of public APIs automatically
- Produces sequence diagrams that accurately represent 90% of call flows
- Creates usage examples that compile and run successfully
- Improves documentation discovery through effective cross-references
- Reduces documentation creation time by 70% compared to manual methods

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup
From within the project directory, set up the development environment:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```
