# ML Pipeline Dependency Tracker

## Overview
A specialized dependency analysis tool for ML engineers to track data lineage, model versioning impacts, and ensure reproducibility across complex machine learning pipelines by understanding dependencies between data processing, training, and evaluation components.

## Persona Description
A ML engineer designing reproducible training pipelines. They need to track dependencies between data processing, model training, and evaluation components.

## Key Requirements
1. **Data lineage tracking through transformation dependencies**: The tool must trace how data flows through preprocessing pipelines, tracking which transformations depend on others, and maintaining provenance information for reproducibility and debugging.

2. **Model versioning impact on downstream pipelines**: Critical for ML operations, the system must analyze how model version changes affect downstream components like evaluation scripts, serving infrastructure, and dependent models in ensemble systems.

3. **Feature engineering dependency validation**: Essential for consistency, the tool must verify that feature transformations are applied consistently across training and inference pipelines, detecting mismatches that could cause training-serving skew.

4. **Experiment reproducibility verification**: To ensure scientific validity, the system must analyze all dependencies (data, code, libraries, random seeds) required to reproduce experiments, identifying missing or ambiguous specifications.

5. **Pipeline stage isolation analysis**: For scalable ML systems, the tool must assess how well pipeline stages are isolated, identifying tight couplings that prevent parallel execution or independent versioning of components.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**: All lineage tracking functions must be unit testable with mock ML pipelines. Integration tests should verify reproducibility checking against real experiment scenarios.
- **Performance expectations**: Must trace lineage through pipelines processing terabytes of data. Analysis should complete within minutes for pipelines with 100+ transformation steps.
- **Integration points**: Must integrate with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), experiment tracking tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases), and data versioning systems (DVC, Pachyderm).
- **Key constraints**: Must handle various data formats, work with distributed processing frameworks, and provide meaningful analysis for both batch and streaming pipelines.

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The analyzer must parse ML pipeline definitions to extract dependency graphs, trace data lineage through transformation chains, verify feature consistency across pipeline stages, analyze model version impacts on downstream components, and assess experiment reproducibility requirements. The system should support custom pipeline frameworks and provide APIs for lineage queries.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate data lineage extraction from pipeline code
  - Correct model version impact analysis
  - Reliable feature consistency validation
  - Complete reproducibility requirement detection
  - Proper pipeline isolation assessment

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Tracking lineage in a multi-stage NLP preprocessing pipeline
  - Analyzing model version changes in a recommendation system
  - Validating feature consistency in a real-time scoring service
  - Verifying reproducibility of a computer vision experiment
  - Assessing isolation in a distributed training pipeline

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Analyze pipelines with 1,000 transformation steps in under 5 minutes
  - Trace lineage for 10,000 features in under 2 minutes
  - Verify reproducibility requirements in under 60 seconds
  - Process model dependency graphs with 100 nodes in under 30 seconds

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Dynamic pipeline construction at runtime
  - Custom transformation functions without clear signatures
  - Distributed processing with partial failure handling
  - Missing version information for data sources
  - Circular dependencies in feature engineering

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for lineage tracking
  - 100% coverage for reproducibility verification
  - Full coverage of consistency validation logic
  - Integration tests for major ML frameworks

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
Clear metrics and outcomes that would indicate the implementation successfully meets this persona's needs:
- Achieves 95% accuracy in data lineage tracking across complex pipelines
- Detects 90% of feature inconsistencies before they cause production issues
- Enables 100% experiment reproducibility when all dependencies are captured
- Reduces debugging time by 60% through clear dependency visualization
- Identifies 85% of opportunities for pipeline parallelization

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup
From within the project directory, set up the development environment:
```bash
