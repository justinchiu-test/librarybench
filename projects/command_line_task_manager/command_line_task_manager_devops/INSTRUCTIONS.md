# InfraTrack - A DevOps Engineer's Task Management Library

## Overview
InfraTrack is a specialized task management library designed specifically for DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure across cloud providers and need to track operations tasks with clear ownership and completion status. This library provides robust APIs for associating tasks with specific infrastructure components, automating task creation from system alerts, capturing command output, tracking time for billing purposes, and generating runbooks from completed tasks.

## Persona Description
Marcus manages infrastructure across cloud providers and needs to track operations tasks with clear ownership and completion status. His primary goal is to associate tasks with specific systems and track time spent on different infrastructure components for client billing.

## Key Requirements
1. **Infrastructure Tagging System**: The library must provide a robust tagging system that links tasks to specific servers, services, and infrastructure components. This is critical for Marcus to maintain clear associations between tasks and the infrastructure they affect, enabling efficient troubleshooting and maintenance tracking across complex environments.

2. **Automated Task Creation from Alerts**: The system should provide APIs to automatically generate tasks from monitoring alerts and system notifications. This capability is essential for Marcus to ensure that no critical alerts are missed and all system issues are properly tracked from detection through resolution.

3. **Command Output Capture**: The library must offer functionality to record and associate exact command executions with their respective tasks. This feature is crucial for Marcus to maintain accurate documentation of the specific commands used to resolve issues or perform maintenance, supporting knowledge sharing and reproducibility.

4. **Time Tracking with Billing Integration**: The system requires comprehensive time tracking capabilities with client and project code associations for generating billing reports. This functionality is vital for Marcus to accurately account for time spent on different infrastructure components and properly bill clients for DevOps services.

5. **Runbook Generation**: The library must support automatic generation of runbooks from sequences of completed tasks with their associated commands and outcomes. This feature is important for Marcus to create standardized procedures for common operations and facilitate knowledge transfer within his team.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock integrations
  - Alert-to-task conversion must be testable with simulated monitoring data
  - Command capture functionality must be testable without executing real commands
  - Time tracking must support simulated time for testing
  - Runbook generation must be verifiable with predefined task sequences

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Task creation and retrieval by infrastructure component < 50ms
  - Alert processing and task generation < 100ms
  - Command capture and association < 30ms
  - Time tracking operations < 20ms
  - The system must handle at least 10,000 tasks with no performance degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - Monitoring and alerting systems (Prometheus, Nagios, CloudWatch, etc.)
  - Command shell environments for output capture
  - Time tracking and billing systems
  - Infrastructure management tools and cloud provider APIs
  - Documentation and runbook repositories

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No direct execution of commands (only recording of commands)
  - Must function in environments with restricted network access
  - All sensitive infrastructure data must be properly secured
  - Must operate with minimal system resource consumption
  - Should function across different infrastructure providers

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Management System**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks with appropriate metadata
   - Support for task prioritization, categorization, and status tracking
   - Clear ownership and assignment functionality
   - Comprehensive filtering and search capabilities

2. **Infrastructure Association**: 
   - Associate tasks with servers, services, and infrastructure components
   - Support hierarchical infrastructure representation
   - Track tasks across multiple cloud providers and environments
   - Enable filtering tasks by infrastructure component

3. **Alert Integration**: 
   - Process alert data from monitoring systems
   - Convert alerts to appropriately structured tasks
   - Manage alert deduplication and correlation
   - Support for alert severity mapping to task priority

4. **Command Management**: 
   - Capture command inputs and outputs
   - Associate commands with specific tasks
   - Support for command categorization and tagging
   - Enable searching historical commands

5. **Time Tracking**: 
   - Track time spent on individual tasks
   - Associate time entries with clients and projects
   - Support for generating billing reports
   - Enable time analysis by infrastructure component

6. **Runbook Generation**: 
   - Create structured documentation from task sequences
   - Include command history with inputs and outputs
   - Support for templating and standardization
   - Enable versioning of generated runbooks

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - Infrastructure tagging and association
  - Alert-to-task conversion
  - Command capture and retrieval
  - Time tracking and reporting
  - Runbook generation from task sequences

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Creating tasks associated with specific infrastructure components
  - Processing system alerts into actionable tasks
  - Capturing command sequences for infrastructure operations
  - Tracking time across multiple client projects
  - Generating runbooks for common operational procedures

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Task retrieval by infrastructure component < 50ms
  - Alert processing and task creation < 100ms
  - Command capture overhead < 30ms
  - Time tracking operations < 20ms
  - Runbook generation < 500ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling malformed alert data
  - Managing infrastructure components that no longer exist
  - Dealing with interrupted command captures
  - Accounting for overlapping time entries
  - Handling incomplete task sequences for runbook generation

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for alert processing and command capture
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
