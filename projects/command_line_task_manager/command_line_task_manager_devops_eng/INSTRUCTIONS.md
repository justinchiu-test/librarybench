# TermTask for DevOps Engineers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for DevOps engineers who need to track operations tasks across multiple infrastructure components. This variant focuses on infrastructure tagging, automated task creation from alerts, command logging, time tracking for billing, and runbook generation to streamline infrastructure management workflows.

## Persona Description
Marcus manages infrastructure across cloud providers and needs to track operations tasks with clear ownership and completion status. His primary goal is to associate tasks with specific systems and track time spent on different infrastructure components for client billing.

## Key Requirements

1. **Infrastructure Tagging System**
   - Link tasks to specific servers, services, and cloud resources
   - Tag-based filtering and organization of tasks
   - Hierarchical infrastructure representation (region > cluster > service)
   - Batch operations on tasks with common infrastructure tags
   - This feature is critical because it helps Marcus organize tasks based on the infrastructure components they affect, enabling efficient prioritization and workload distribution among his team.

2. **Alert-to-Task Automation**
   - Automatically create tasks from monitoring system alerts
   - Parse alert data to populate task fields appropriately
   - Deduplicate similar alerts into single actionable tasks
   - Track alert-generated task resolution metrics
   - This feature is essential because it transforms passive monitoring alerts into actionable work items, ensuring critical system issues don't get overlooked and providing accountability for resolution.

3. **Command Logging and Documentation**
   - Capture exact commands run for task completion
   - Store command history with execution timestamps and results
   - Document environment variables and context for reproducibility
   - Search previously executed commands by task or infrastructure component
   - This capability is vital because it creates an auditable history of infrastructure changes, facilitates knowledge sharing among team members, and enables recovery procedures during incidents.

4. **Time Tracking and Billing Reports**
   - Track time spent on tasks with client/project code integration
   - Generate itemized billing reports for client invoicing
   - Analyze time distribution across infrastructure components
   - Support for time entry verification and approval workflows
   - This feature is critical for Marcus to accurately bill clients for infrastructure work and provide transparency into how operational time is being spent across different systems.

5. **Automated Runbook Generation**
   - Create documentation from completed task sequences
   - Transform command histories into executable runbooks
   - Version control for operational procedures
   - Export runbooks in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
   - This feature saves Marcus time by automatically generating procedural documentation from actual work performed, ensuring operational knowledge is captured systematically for future reference.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock monitoring system alerts for testing alert-to-task automation
- Simulated command execution environments for testing command logging
- Time entry simulation for testing billing report generation
- Runbook generation must be testable with predefined task sequences
- All components must support dependency injection for testing with mocks

### Performance Expectations
- Support for processing 100+ concurrent monitoring alerts
- Handle 1000+ infrastructure components without performance degradation
- Time tracking with millisecond precision for accurate billing
- Command logging should not impact command execution performance
- Runbook generation for 50+ steps should complete in under 3 seconds

### Integration Points
- Monitoring system alert feeds (compatible with standard formats)
- Command shell history and output capture
- Time tracking data for billing systems
- Documentation systems for runbook publishing
- Infrastructure management tools for component discovery

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely in command-line environment
- Cannot interfere with normal shell operations
- Must preserve data integrity during interrupted operations
- Minimal CPU/memory footprint to avoid impacting server performance
- Must handle intermittent connectivity to cloud resources

## Core Functionality

1. **Task Management Engine**
   - Create, read, update, and delete operations tasks
   - Organize tasks by status, priority, deadline, and ownership
   - Filter tasks based on infrastructure components and attributes
   - Support for task dependencies and escalation paths
   - Persistence layer with transaction support for data integrity

2. **Infrastructure Component Registry**
   - Maintain registry of infrastructure components and relationships
   - Support for tagging and hierarchical organization
   - Component discovery and synchronization capabilities
   - Health status integration with monitoring systems
   - Task association with specific components and systems

3. **Alert Processing System**
   - Monitor alert channels for new notifications
   - Parse and normalize alerts from different sources
   - Convert alerts to actionable task items
   - Implement deduplication and correlation logic
   - Track alert-to-resolution metrics and performance

4. **Command Recording Framework**
   - Capture shell commands with execution context
   - Store command outputs and return codes
   - Associate commands with specific tasks
   - Provide searchable command history
   - Export commands as executable scripts

5. **Time Management System**
   - Track time entries against tasks
   - Associate time with clients, projects, and infrastructure components
   - Calculate billable time based on configurable rules
   - Generate reports for billing and operational analysis
   - Support for time verification workflows

6. **Documentation Generator**
   - Convert task sequences to structured documentation
   - Format command histories as executable procedures
   - Support for documentation templates and customization
   - Version control for generated documentation
   - Export to multiple documentation formats

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Infrastructure tagging correctly organizes tasks by component
- Alert processing accurately creates appropriate tasks
- Command logging captures exact commands with context
- Time tracking correctly associates time with tasks and generates accurate reports
