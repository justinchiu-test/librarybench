# TermTask for Freelance Developers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for freelance developers working across multiple client projects. This variant focuses on client portal integration, invoicing automation, milestone tracking, proposal management, and offline operation to streamline the business aspects of freelance development work.

## Persona Description
Mia works on multiple freelance projects with different clients and needs to track billable hours accurately. Her primary goal is to organize client-specific tasks and generate billing reports based on time tracked against specific deliverables.

## Key Requirements

1. **Client Portal Integration**
   - Allow clients to view task status without CLI access
   - Generate client-friendly status pages and progress reports
   - Support client commenting and priority adjustment
   - Control visibility of internal notes vs. client-facing information
   - This feature is critical because it enables professional client communication without extra effort, allowing Mia to give clients visibility into project progress while maintaining her preferred command-line workflow for efficiency.

2. **Invoicing Automation**
   - Generate itemized bills from completed tasks
   - Calculate billable amounts based on tracked time and rates
   - Support different rate structures by client and task type
   - Track payment status and send reminders
   - This capability is essential because accurate, timely invoicing is critical for Mia's cash flow, and automation reduces errors while saving administrative time that can be better spent on billable work.

3. **Contract Milestone Tracking**
   - Define and monitor contract deliverables and deadlines
   - Link milestones to payment schedules
   - Track milestone approval and signoff processes
   - Generate milestone-based progress reports
   - This feature is vital because it helps Mia organize work around contractual obligations, ensures timely delivery of client commitments, and links project progress directly to payment schedules.

4. **Proposal and Client Acquisition Management**
   - Convert proposals to project tasks upon acceptance
   - Track proposal status and follow-ups
   - Estimate time requirements for prospective work
   - Analyze historical project data for better estimates
   - This functionality is critical because effective proposal management impacts Mia's business growth, and the ability to convert accepted proposals directly into structured tasks streamlines project initialization.

5. **Offline-First Operation**
   - Work without internet connectivity during travel/remote work
   - Synchronize data when connectivity is restored
   - Conflict resolution for changes made offline
   - Prioritize tasks for offline periods
   - This feature is essential because Mia often works while traveling or in locations with unreliable internet, and needs her task management system to function flawlessly regardless of connectivity status.

## Technical Requirements
