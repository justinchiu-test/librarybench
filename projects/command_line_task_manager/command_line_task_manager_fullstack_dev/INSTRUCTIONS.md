# TermTask for Full-Stack Developers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system optimized for full-stack developers who juggle multiple client projects simultaneously. This variant integrates seamlessly with git workflows, allowing developers to associate tasks with specific branches and commits while providing project context awareness based on the current working directory.

## Persona Description
Rachel builds web applications across multiple client projects simultaneously and needs to track numerous development tasks without disrupting her coding flow. Her primary goal is to organize project-specific tasks and seamlessly integrate task management with her git workflow to associate tasks with specific commits and branches.

## Key Requirements

1. **Git Integration**
   - Automatically link tasks to git commits and branches
   - Enable task creation from branch names
   - Allow commit messages to be generated from task details
   - Track task completion status based on commit history
   - This feature is critical because it eliminates context switching between task management and code versioning, allowing Rachel to maintain a single source of truth for work completed.

2. **Project Context Awareness**
   - Filter tasks based on the current working directory
   - Automatically switch task context when changing directories
   - Support multiple concurrent project workspaces
   - Preserve task state across project switches
   - This feature is essential because Rachel works on multiple client projects simultaneously and needs her task view to automatically adapt to her current coding context.

3. **Development Workflow Templates**
   - Predefined task templates for common workflows (bug fix, feature, refactor)
   - Customizable template fields for different project requirements
   - Batch task creation from templates for sprint planning
   - Historical analysis of workflow completion times
   - This feature streamlines Rachel's task creation process by standardizing common development workflows, ensuring consistent task tracking across different types of work.

4. **IDE Terminal Integration**
   - Compatible with VSCode/WebStorm terminal functionality
   - Support for task visualization within the IDE terminal
   - Keyboard shortcuts that don't conflict with IDE bindings
   - Status line integration showing current task context
   - This capability is vital because Rachel spends most of her time in IDE terminals and needs task information accessible without switching applications.

5. **Automated Documentation Generation**
   - Generate PR/commit messages based on completed task details
   - Create changelogs from completed tasks
   - Document task completion history for client reporting
   - Link tasks to project documentation
   - This feature saves Rachel time by automatically generating documentation from completed work, ensuring comprehensive records for client handoffs and team knowledge sharing.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All core functionality must be accessible through a well-defined Python API
- Functions should be pure whenever possible to facilitate unit testing
- Mock git repositories must be supported for integration testing
- Testing should not require actual git operations to be performed
- Mock filesystem for testing directory-based context switching

### Performance Expectations
- Task context switching should occur in under 100ms
- Git operations should be non-blocking and not freeze the task management functionality
- Support for repositories with 10,000+ commits
- Support for managing 1,000+ active tasks across 20+ projects
- All operations should be responsive in terminal environments

### Integration Points
- Git CLI (reading repository state, branches, commits)
- Local filesystem (determining project contexts)
- IDE terminal environments
- Task database (SQLite or similar for persistence)
- Export formats for documentation (Markdown, plain text)

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely within terminal environment
- No external services or APIs required for core functionality
- Minimal dependencies beyond Python standard library
- Must preserve data integrity during interrupted operations
- Cannot interfere with git operations or repository state

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the TermTask system for full-stack developers includes:

1. **Task Management Core**
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks
   - Organize tasks by project, type, priority, and status
   - Support for task dependencies and blocking relationships
   - Task search and filtering capabilities
   - Persistent storage with data integrity protection

2. **Git Integration Layer**
   - Repository state detection and branch awareness
   - Task-to-commit linking mechanisms
   - Commit message generation from task attributes
   - Branch naming suggestions based on task details
   - Historical task completion tracking via git history

3. **Context Management System**
   - Working directory detection and monitoring
   - Project context rules and configurations
   - Automatic task filtering based on detected context
   - Context persistence and state management
   - Multiple simultaneous context support

4. **Workflow Templating Engine**
   - Template definition and storage
   - Template instantiation with variable substitution
   - Template categories for different development activities
   - Template usage analytics and optimization
   - Template sharing and version control

5. **Documentation Generator**
   - Structured data extraction from completed tasks
   - Format-specific output generation
   - Timeline-based report creation
   - Client-ready documentation formatting
   - Customizable documentation templates

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Task creation, modification, and status tracking functions correctly
- Git integration accurately links tasks with commits and branches
- Context switching correctly filters tasks based on working directory
- Workflow templates create properly structured tasks
- Documentation generation produces accurate and well-formatted output

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a new task for a specific git branch
- Completing a task and committing the associated code
- Switching between project directories and seeing relevant tasks only
- Using templates to create standardized workflow tasks
- Generating PR descriptions from completed task information

### Performance Benchmarks
- Context switching completes in < 100ms
- Task operations (create, read, update) complete in < 50ms
- Supporting 10,000+ historical tasks without performance degradation
- Git operations do not block UI for repositories with 5,000+ commits
- Documentation generation for 100+ tasks completes in < 1s

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Working with uncommitted changes
- Handling git conflicts and rebasing scenarios
- Recovering from interrupted operations
- Working with offline/disconnected git repositories
- Handling malformed task data or corrupted state

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 85% code coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage for data persistence operations
- Comprehensive integration tests for git operations
- Performance tests for all critical paths
- API contract tests for all public interfaces

## Success Criteria
- The system allows seamless switching between projects, automatically showing relevant tasks
- Tasks can be created, tracked, and completed within the git workflow without context switching
- Documentation generation saves at least 30 minutes per week in administrative time
- Development workflow templates standardize task tracking across different types of work
- The system operates entirely within the terminal/IDE environment without requiring external tools
- Task management operations are fast enough to not disrupt the development workflow
- Git integration provides valuable insights without requiring changes to normal git workflows
