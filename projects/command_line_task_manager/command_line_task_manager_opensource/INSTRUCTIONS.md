# OSS TaskHub - An Open Source Project Maintainer's Task Management Library

## Overview
OSS TaskHub is a specialized task management library designed specifically for open source project maintainers who coordinate tasks across multiple repositories and contributors. This library provides robust APIs for synchronizing with GitHub Issues, tracking contributor activities, planning releases, identifying beginner-friendly tasks, and monitoring project health metrics to streamline open source project management.

## Persona Description
Chen manages multiple open source projects and needs to coordinate tasks across contributors and project roadmaps. His primary goal is to synchronize project management across GitHub repositories and provide contributor-friendly task organization.

## Key Requirements
1. **GitHub Issues Synchronization**: The library must provide bidirectional synchronization with GitHub Issues, ensuring that tasks are kept up-to-date across platforms. This is critical for Chen to maintain a single source of truth while allowing contributors to interact through familiar GitHub interfaces, eliminating duplicate work and ensuring consistent task tracking.

2. **Contributor Assignment and Activity Tracking**: The system should support comprehensive tracking of contributor assignments and activity metrics. This feature is essential for Chen to monitor who is working on what, track contribution patterns, identify bottlenecks, and ensure balanced workload distribution across the contributor community.

3. **Release Planning View**: The library must organize tasks by milestone and version to facilitate release planning. This functionality is crucial for Chen to maintain clear roadmaps for each project, track progress toward release goals, and communicate timelines effectively to the contributor community and users.

4. **Mentorship Mode for New Contributors**: The system needs to support tagging and filtering tasks appropriate for new contributors. This feature is vital for Chen to foster community growth by clearly identifying entry points for newcomers, reducing barriers to entry, and facilitating effective mentorship.

5. **Project Health Metrics**: The library must generate visualizations and metrics on contribution patterns and completion rates. This capability is important for Chen to objectively assess project vitality, identify trends in community engagement, and make data-driven decisions about project direction and resource allocation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock GitHub data
  - GitHub API interactions must be properly mocked in test environments
  - Release planning functionality must be testable with simulated project data
  - Contributor metrics must be verifiable with predefined activity patterns
  - Project health visualizations must be testable with synthetic data

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - GitHub synchronization operations < 2 seconds
  - Task retrieval and filtering < 50ms
  - Contributor activity analysis < 200ms
  - Release planning view generation < 100ms
  - Health metrics calculation < 500ms for projects with 1000+ tasks

- **Integration Points**:
  - GitHub API for issues, pull requests, and contributor data
  - Version control systems for release tracking
  - Notification systems for contributor communication
  - Data export for metrics visualization
  - External authentication for contributor identification

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must respect GitHub API rate limits
  - Task data must be cacheable for offline operation
  - Sensitive contributor information must be properly secured
  - Minimal external dependencies to ensure portability
  - Must support projects with 1000+ contributors and 10,000+ tasks

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Management System**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks with appropriate metadata
   - Support for task categorization, prioritization, and status tracking
   - Tagging system for task classification and filtering
   - Search functionality with advanced filtering options

2. **GitHub Integration**: 
   - Bidirectional synchronization with GitHub Issues
   - Mapping between local tasks and GitHub issue properties
   - Support for comments, labels, and assignees
   - Conflict resolution for synchronization discrepancies

3. **Contributor Management**: 
   - Track contributor assignments and workloads
   - Monitor activity levels and engagement patterns
   - Support for contributor profiles and expertise areas
   - Contribution history and impact metrics

4. **Release Planning**: 
   - Organize tasks by milestone and version
   - Track progress toward release goals
   - Dependency management between tasks
   - Timeline estimation and deadline tracking

5. **Newcomer Support**: 
   - Tag tasks suitable for new contributors
   - Track mentorship connections and interactions
   - Provide difficulty ratings and estimated effort
   - Document prerequisites and getting started information

6. **Project Metrics**: 
   - Calculate contribution frequency and volume
   - Track task completion rates and cycle times
   - Monitor community engagement metrics
   - Generate trend analysis over time

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - GitHub synchronization (both directions)
  - Contributor assignment and activity tracking
  - Release planning and milestone organization
  - Newcomer task identification
  - Project health metrics calculation

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Synchronizing a set of tasks with GitHub Issues
  - Assigning tasks to contributors and tracking progress
  - Planning a release with specific milestones and tasks
  - Identifying and tagging tasks for new contributors
  - Generating project health reports for community review

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - GitHub synchronization < 2 seconds for 100 issues
  - Task filtering by complex criteria < 50ms
  - Contributor metrics generation < 200ms
  - Release view generation < 100ms
  - Health metrics for a large project < 500ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling GitHub API rate limiting and failures
  - Managing conflicts in bidirectional synchronization
  - Dealing with contributor role changes
  - Adapting to project reorganization and milestone changes
  - Recovering from interrupted operations

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for GitHub synchronization components
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
