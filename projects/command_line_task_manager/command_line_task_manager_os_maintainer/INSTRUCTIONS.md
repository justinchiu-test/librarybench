# TermTask for Open Source Project Maintainers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for open source project maintainers who coordinate across multiple repositories and contributors. This variant integrates with GitHub, provides contributor coordination features, release planning tools, newcomer-friendly task tagging, and comprehensive project health metrics.

## Persona Description
Chen manages multiple open source projects and needs to coordinate tasks across contributors and project roadmaps. His primary goal is to synchronize project management across GitHub repositories and provide contributor-friendly task organization.

## Key Requirements

1. **GitHub Issues Synchronization**
   - Bidirectional syncing between local tasks and GitHub Issues
   - Comment, label, and milestone synchronization
   - Bulk issue operations from the command line
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
   - This feature is critical because it allows Chen to manage GitHub Issues efficiently from his terminal workflow while maintaining consistency with the public-facing issue tracker, reducing context switching while engaging with contributors.

2. **Contributor Assignment and Tracking**
   - Assign tasks to specific contributors
   - Track contributor activity and completion rates
   - Manage reviewer assignments for PRs
   - Notify contributors of task updates
   - This capability is essential because it provides visibility into who is working on what, helps balance workload across contributors, and ensures no tasks fall through the cracks in a distributed team environment.

3. **Release Planning and Milestone Management**
   - Organize tasks by milestone and version
   - Track progress toward release completion
   - Forecast release dates based on task completion velocity
   - Generate release notes from completed tasks
   - This feature is vital because it helps Chen organize the project roadmap, communicate clear timelines to users and contributors, and ensures all necessary tasks are completed before releases.

4. **Newcomer-Friendly Task Identification**
   - Tag tasks appropriate for new contributors
   - Categorize tasks by required expertise and complexity
   - Provide mentorship pairing suggestions
   - Track first-time contributor engagement metrics
   - This functionality is critical because it helps Chen grow the contributor base by identifying approachable entry points for newcomers, reducing the barrier to entry for contributing to open source projects.

5. **Project Health Metrics and Visualization**
   - Visualize contribution patterns and completion rates
   - Track issue response and resolution times
   - Monitor bug vs. feature task distribution
   - Analyze contributor retention metrics
   - This feature is essential because it provides insights into project momentum, community health, and potential areas of improvement, helping Chen make data-driven decisions about project priorities.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock GitHub API for testing Issues synchronization
- Simulated contributor activity for testing assignment and tracking
- Historical data generation for testing release planning
- Synthetic contribution patterns for testing health metrics
- Task classification testing for newcomer tagging accuracy

### Performance Expectations
- Support for synchronizing 10,000+ GitHub issues
- Handle 500+ contributors across multiple repositories
- Process release planning for 1,000+ tasks per milestone
- Generate project health metrics reports in under 3 seconds
- Responsive CLI performance even with large repositories

### Integration Points
- GitHub API (issues, milestones, labels, comments)
- Git repositories (branches, commits, tags)
- Notification systems (email, webhook)
- Documentation systems for release notes
- Analytics visualization (for project health metrics)

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely in command-line environment
- Respect GitHub API rate limits
- Support offline operation with synchronization when online
- Minimal resource usage for contributor accessibility
- Handle intermittent connectivity gracefully

## Core Functionality

   - Collaborative task editing and commenting
   - Persistence with conflict resolution

2. **GitHub Synchronization Engine**
   - Bidirectional synchronization with GitHub Issues
   - Comment and metadata synchronization
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Rate limit handling and retry logic
   - Selective synchronization options

3. **Contributor Management System**
   - Contributor profiles and expertise tracking
   - Task assignment and ownership management
   - Contribution history and metrics
   - Mentorship relationship tracking
   - Notification and communication channels

4. **Release Management Framework**
   - Milestone and version definition
   - Task organization by release target
   - Progress tracking toward release goals
   - Release notes generation
   - Timeline forecasting and scheduling

5. **Newcomer Task Classification**
   - Task complexity estimation
   - Required expertise identification
   - Good-first-issue tagging system
   - Mentorship opportunity flagging
   - Onboarding path generation

6. **Project Analytics Engine**
   - Contribution pattern analysis
   - Response time and resolution metrics
   - Contributor engagement scoring
   - Trend analysis and forecasting
   - Report generation and visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- GitHub Issues synchronize correctly in both directions
- Contributor assignments are tracked accurately
- Release planning correctly organizes tasks and tracks progress
- Tasks are appropriately tagged for newcomer accessibility
- Project health metrics accurately reflect contribution patterns

### Critical User Scenarios
- Triaging new GitHub issues and assigning to contributors
- Planning a release milestone and tracking progress
- Onboarding a new contributor with appropriate first tasks
- Generating release notes for a completed milestone
- Analyzing project health metrics to identify areas for improvement

### Performance Benchmarks
- GitHub synchronization of 1,000 issues completes in under 60 seconds
- Assignment changes propagate to GitHub within 5 seconds
- Release planning calculations for 500+ tasks complete in under 2 seconds
- Newcomer task identification processes 100 tasks per second
- Health metrics generation for projects with 10,000+ contributions in under 5 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling GitHub API rate limiting and service disruptions
- Managing conflicting updates from multiple contributors
- Recovering from interrupted synchronization operations
- Dealing with repository migrations or restructuring
- Processing unusual contribution patterns or outliers
- Handling projects with very large numbers of issues or contributors

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core functionality
