# OSS-TaskHub - Command-Line Task Management for Open Source Projects

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for open source project maintainers who need to coordinate tasks across multiple contributors and project roadmaps. The system enables bidirectional synchronization with GitHub Issues, tracks contributor activities, and provides comprehensive project health metrics and release planning capabilities.

## Persona Description
Chen manages multiple open source projects and needs to coordinate tasks across contributors and project roadmaps. His primary goal is to synchronize project management across GitHub repositories and provide contributor-friendly task organization.

## Key Requirements
1. **GitHub Issues Synchronization**: Implement bidirectional synchronization between the task manager and GitHub Issues, ensuring changes made in either system are reflected in the other. This feature is critical for Chen as it enables him to manage project tasks locally while maintaining transparency with the broader community, eliminates duplicate work of updating multiple systems, and ensures consistency between internal planning and public-facing issue tracking.

2. **Contributor Assignment and Activity Tracking**: Create functionality to assign tasks to specific contributors and track their activity metrics. This capability allows Chen to monitor contributor engagement across multiple repositories, identify active/inactive contributors for better workload distribution, and recognize patterns in contributor interests and expertise for optimal task assignment.

3. **Release Planning View**: Develop an organizational system that groups tasks by milestone and version, providing a comprehensive release planning mechanism. This feature enables Chen to strategically plan release timelines based on task dependencies and contributor availability, track progress toward specific milestones across multiple repositories, and maintain a clear roadmap for each project.

4. **Mentorship Mode**: Build a specialized tagging system that identifies tasks appropriate for new contributors, with additional context and support information. This system helps Chen grow his open source communities by highlighting beginner-friendly tasks, provides clear pathways for onboarding new contributors, and facilitates mentorship by connecting appropriate experienced members with newcomers.

5. **Project Health Metrics**: Implement analytics functionality that visualizes contribution patterns, completion rates, and other project vitality indicators. These metrics allow Chen to identify projects needing additional attention or resources, recognize trends in community engagement over time, and make data-driven decisions about project priorities and resource allocation.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- GitHub API integration must be testable with mock responses
- Contributor tracking must be unit testable with simulated activity data
- Release planning components must be verifiable with predefined milestone and task inputs
- Mentorship tagging system must be testable in isolation from other components
- Metrics calculations must be verifiable with predetermined inputs and expected outputs
- All components must support testing with mock data sources

### Performance Expectations
- GitHub synchronization must handle repositories with 10,000+ issues efficiently
- Contributor metrics calculations must complete in <5 seconds for projects with 500+ contributors
- Release planning operations must maintain performance with 50+ concurrent milestones
- The system must support tracking at least 100 separate repositories simultaneously
- Metrics visualization data must be generated in <3 seconds even for large projects

### Integration Points
- GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs
- Local data storage system with synchronization capability
- Authentication mechanism for GitHub API access
- Version control system for tracking release plans
- Export formats for metrics and reports

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must handle rate limiting from GitHub APIs gracefully
- All functionality must be accessible via programmatic API without UI components
- Authentication tokens must be stored securely
- The system must maintain state across synchronization operations
- Performance must degrade gracefully with very large repositories or many contributors

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Task Management Engine**: A core module handling CRUD operations for tasks with attributes specific to open source project management including assignee, repository, milestone, and tagging capabilities.

2. **GitHub Synchronization System**: A robust synchronization mechanism that maintains bidirectional updates between local tasks and GitHub Issues, handling conflicts and ensuring data consistency.

3. **Contributor Management**: Functionality to track contributors across repositories, including assignment history, activity metrics, and expertise areas.

4. **Release Planning Framework**: A structured organization system for grouping tasks by milestone, version, and release timeline, with dependency tracking and progress visualization.

5. **Mentorship System**: Logic for tagging and organizing tasks appropriate for new contributors, including difficulty assessment, required skills, and mentorship information.

6. **Analytics Engine**: Components for calculating and presenting project health metrics, contributor engagement patterns, and milestone progress across multiple repositories.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with open source specific metadata
- GitHub synchronization with bidirectional updates
- Contributor tracking and activity metrics calculation
- Release planning organization and milestone tracking
- Mentorship task tagging and identification
- Project health metrics generation and accuracy

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete workflow from GitHub Issue creation to local task management
- Tracking contributor activity across multiple repositories
- Planning a release with tasks grouped by milestone and priority
- Identifying and tagging tasks appropriate for new contributors
- Generating project health reports across multiple repositories

### Performance Benchmarks
- GitHub synchronization must process at least 100 issues per second
- Contributor metrics calculations must handle repositories with 500+ contributors
- Release planning must maintain performance with 50+ concurrent milestones
- Task filtering and querying must complete in <100ms for common operations
- Project health metrics generation must process at least 10,000 tasks in <5 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling GitHub API rate limiting and service interruptions
- Resolving conflicts between local and remote changes
- Recovery from failed synchronization operations
- Proper behavior with repositories of vastly different sizes and activity levels
- Graceful degradation when dealing with extremely large datasets
- Handling contributors who change usernames or use multiple accounts

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Integration tests must verify GitHub API interaction patterns

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system demonstrates seamless bidirectional synchronization with GitHub Issues.
3. Contributor tracking accurately records activity and assignments across repositories.
4. Release planning effectively organizes tasks by milestone and version.
5. Mentorship mode correctly identifies and tags tasks appropriate for new contributors.
6. Project health metrics provide meaningful insights into project status and community engagement.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. The implementation handles errors, conflicts, and edge cases gracefully.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
