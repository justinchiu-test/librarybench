# BizTrack - A Product Manager's Task Management Library

## Overview
BizTrack is a specialized task management library designed specifically for product managers who oversee development across multiple teams and need to track feature progress without requiring developer tools. This library provides robust APIs for translating technical tasks into business objectives, offering simplified command interfaces, generating executive reports, visualizing product roadmaps, and facilitating stakeholder feedback to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business goals.

## Persona Description
Dana oversees product development across multiple teams and needs to track feature progress without requiring developer tools. Her primary goal is to get visibility into technical tasks and translate them into business impact tracking for stakeholders.

## Key Requirements
1. **Technical-to-Business Translation View**: The library must provide functionality to group and present technical tasks in terms of business objectives and value. This is critical for Dana to communicate progress to non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that technical work is properly contextualized within broader business goals and measurable outcomes.

2. **Simplified CLI Interface**: The system should support preset commands and simplified interfaces for users without technical backgrounds. This feature is essential for Dana to interact with task management without requiring developer-level command line expertise, making the system accessible while maintaining its integration with the development workflow.

3. **Executive Report Generation**: The library must offer automated generation of reports focusing on strategic metrics and business impact. This functionality is crucial for Dana to efficiently create insightful summaries for leadership, highlighting progress toward business objectives rather than technical implementation details.

4. **Roadmap Visualization**: The system needs to generate visual representations showing task progression towards product goals. This feature is vital for Dana to communicate product development timelines, dependencies, and milestone progress to both technical and non-technical audiences in an intuitive format.

5. **Stakeholder Comment System**: The library must support a mechanism for stakeholders to provide feedback without requiring full task manager adoption. This capability is important for Dana to maintain bidirectional communication with business stakeholders, ensuring their input is captured and associated with relevant product features.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock product and task data
  - Business translation functionality must be verifiable with predefined mapping rules
  - Report generation must be testable with synthetic progress data
  - Roadmap visualization must be testable with simulated product timelines
  - Stakeholder comment system must support test feedback entries

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Business view generation < 100ms
  - Simplified command execution < 50ms
  - Report generation < 500ms for complex products
  - Roadmap visualization < 300ms
  - Comment processing < 50ms
  - The system must handle at least 20 concurrent products with thousands of tasks

- **Integration Points**:
  - Technical task management systems
  - Business intelligence and reporting platforms
  - Visualization libraries for roadmap rendering
  - Notification systems for stakeholder comments
  - Authentication systems for stakeholder access control
  - Export mechanisms for various document formats

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No direct exposure of technical implementation details
  - Business rules must be configurable without code changes
  - Reports must be exportable to common formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)
  - Visualizations must be generatable as static images
  - Stakeholder access must be secured with appropriate controls

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Translation System**: 
   - Map technical tasks to business objectives
   - Group tasks by business value and impact
   - Track progress in business terms
   - Support customizable business categorization

2. **Simplified Command Interface**: 
   - Provide preset command templates for common operations
   - Abstract complex technical syntax
   - Support natural language-inspired commands
   - Include helpful guidance and error handling

3. **Report Generation**: 
   - Create structured reports with business metrics
   - Highlight progress toward strategic objectives
   - Support various time periods and comparison views
   - Include executive summaries and key insights

4. **Roadmap Management**: 
   - Visualize task progression toward product goals
   - Show dependencies and critical paths
   - Track milestone achievement
   - Support different timeline views (sprint, quarter, year)

5. **Stakeholder Interaction**: 
   - Capture and associate comments with product features
   - Notify relevant team members of feedback
   - Track response status to stakeholder input
   - Support prioritization based on stakeholder importance

6. **Business Impact Analysis**: 
   - Quantify business value of completed tasks
   - Track progress against OKRs and business goals
   - Predict timeline for business value realization
   - Identify bottlenecks in value delivery

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Technical-to-business task translation
  - Simplified command execution
  - Executive report generation
  - Roadmap visualization
  - Stakeholder comment processing
  - Business impact analysis

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Generating a business view of technical progress
  - Executing product management tasks with simplified commands
  - Creating executive reports for quarterly business reviews
  - Visualizing a product roadmap with dependencies
  - Capturing and processing stakeholder feedback
  - Analyzing business impact of development activities

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Business view generation < 100ms
  - Command execution < 50ms
  - Report generation < 500ms for complex products
  - Roadmap visualization < 300ms
  - Comment processing < 50ms
  - Impact analysis < 200ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling tasks without clear business mapping
  - Managing complex command syntax from non-technical users
  - Dealing with insufficient data for meaningful reports
  - Visualizing products with uncertain timelines
  - Processing ambiguous stakeholder feedback
  - Quantifying business impact with limited metrics

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for business translation and reporting
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
