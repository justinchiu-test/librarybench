# TermTask for Product Managers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for product managers who need visibility into technical development without requiring developer tools. This variant focuses on business objective alignment, simplified command interfaces, executive reporting, roadmap visualization, and stakeholder communication to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business goals.

## Persona Description
Dana oversees product development across multiple teams and needs to track feature progress without requiring developer tools. Her primary goal is to get visibility into technical tasks and translate them into business impact tracking for stakeholders.

## Key Requirements

1. **Business Objective Translation View**
   - Group technical tasks by business objectives and initiatives
   - Map development work to strategic goals and KPIs
   - Track progress toward business outcomes
   - Visualize technical debt and infrastructure investment
   - This feature is critical because it connects day-to-day development work to strategic business goals, enabling Dana to communicate how engineering efforts directly contribute to company objectives and justify resource allocation.

2. **Simplified Command Interface**
   - Provide preset commands for common product management needs
   - Create natural language aliases for technical operations
   - Implement guided workflows for complex operations
   - Support task management without requiring technical expertise
   - This capability is essential because it makes the command-line interface accessible to product managers without technical backgrounds, allowing Dana to leverage powerful CLI functionality without a steep learning curve.

3. **Executive Reporting System**
   - Generate stakeholder-friendly progress reports
   - Focus on strategic metrics and business outcomes
   - Customize reporting for different audience types
   - Schedule recurring report generation and distribution
   - This feature is vital because it automates the creation of executive-level communications, saving Dana significant time in report preparation while ensuring consistent, accurate representation of project status to leadership.

4. **Product Roadmap Visualization**
   - Display task progression toward product goals
   - Show feature development status and timelines
   - Visualize dependencies between features and components
   - Support for milestone and release planning
   - This functionality is critical because it provides a clear visual representation of product development progress, helps communicate timelines to stakeholders, and identifies potential bottlenecks or dependencies affecting delivery.

5. **Stakeholder Feedback System**
   - Allow stakeholder comments without full system adoption
   - Capture and organize feedback by feature and priority
   - Link stakeholder input to specific product areas
   - Track resolution of stakeholder concerns
   - This feature is essential because it creates a structured channel for stakeholder input, helps prioritize development based on feedback, and closes the loop on stakeholder communication without requiring everyone to use the full task management system.

## Technical Requirements
