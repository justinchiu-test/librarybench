# TestTrack - A QA Engineer's Task Management Library

## Overview
TestTrack is a specialized task management library designed specifically for QA engineers who perform quality assurance testing across multiple product features. This library provides robust APIs for tracking test cases, documenting bug reports, capturing visual evidence, visualizing test coverage, and monitoring regression testing to ensure methodical and comprehensive quality assurance processes.

## Persona Description
Jamal performs quality assurance testing across multiple product features and needs to track test cases and bug reports methodically. His primary goal is to associate test tasks with specific features and efficiently document test results with evidence.

## Key Requirements
1. **Test Case Templating**: The library must provide robust templating for test cases with expected results and pass/fail tracking. This is critical for Jamal to maintain standardized test procedures across different features, ensuring consistent testing methodologies and clearly defined success criteria for each test scenario.

2. **Bug Reporting Workflow**: The system should support comprehensive bug reporting with automatic environment information capture. This feature is essential for Jamal to document discovered issues with all relevant context, making it easier for developers to reproduce and fix bugs without requiring additional information requests.

3. **Screenshot/Recording Attachment**: The library must offer capabilities to attach visual evidence (screenshots, screen recordings) to test results and bug reports. This functionality is crucial for Jamal to provide clear visual documentation of issues, reducing ambiguity in bug reports and providing definitive evidence of test outcomes.

4. **Test Coverage Visualization**: The system needs to generate visualizations of test coverage by feature and component. This feature is vital for Jamal to identify gaps in testing, prioritize testing efforts for under-covered areas, and provide stakeholders with clear metrics on quality assurance progress.

5. **Regression Tracking**: The library must support identifying related tests for code changes to facilitate regression testing. This capability is important for Jamal to ensure that changes to one component don't break functionality in related areas, maintaining product quality through comprehensive regression test selection.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock test data
  - Test case template functionality must be verifiable with various template types
  - Bug reporting workflow must be testable without actual system information
  - Coverage visualization must be testable with predefined coverage data
  - Regression identification must be verifiable with simulated code changes

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Test case creation and retrieval < 50ms
  - Bug report generation < 100ms including environment information
  - Screenshot/recording attachment operations < 200ms
  - Coverage visualization generation < 300ms for projects with thousands of tests
  - Regression test identification < 150ms
  - The system must handle at least 10,000 test cases and 5,000 bug reports with no performance degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - Test management systems
  - Bug tracking and issue management tools
  - Screenshot and recording capture utilities
  - Code repository for change tracking
  - Test coverage analysis tools
  - Test execution frameworks

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Visual evidence must be stored efficiently or by reference
  - Environment information must be captured securely
  - Support for various test frameworks and methodologies
  - Compatibility with different bug tracking systems
  - Cross-platform operation for diverse testing environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Test Management System**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete test cases with appropriate metadata
   - Support for test categorization by feature, component, and priority
   - Track test execution status and results
   - Manage test dependencies and prerequisites

2. **Test Case Templating**: 
   - Define and apply templates for different types of tests
   - Include steps, expected results, and validation criteria
   - Support custom fields for domain-specific testing
   - Track template usage and effectiveness

3. **Bug Management**: 
   - Create structured bug reports with clear reproduction steps
   - Capture relevant environment information automatically
   - Track bug status, severity, and resolution
   - Link bugs to test cases and affected features

4. **Evidence Management**: 
   - Attach screenshots and recordings to test results
   - Support for annotating visual evidence
   - Manage evidence storage and retrieval
   - Associate evidence with specific test steps or bugs

5. **Coverage Analysis**: 
   - Track which features and components are covered by tests
   - Visualize coverage gaps and testing density
   - Monitor coverage trends over time
   - Prioritize testing based on coverage metrics

6. **Regression Management**: 
   - Identify tests affected by code changes
   - Create regression test suites dynamically
   - Track regression test results separately
   - Analyze historical test stability

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Test case creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - Template application and customization
  - Bug report generation with environment information
  - Screenshot and recording attachment
  - Coverage visualization accuracy
  - Regression test identification

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Creating a test suite for a new feature using templates
  - Documenting a bug with full environment context and screenshots
  - Analyzing test coverage for a product component
  - Identifying regression tests needed for a code change
  - Tracking test execution results across multiple test runs

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Test case operations < 50ms
  - Bug report generation < 100ms
  - Evidence attachment < 200ms
  - Coverage analysis < 300ms for large test suites
  - Regression identification < 150ms for complex code changes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling very large screenshots or recordings
  - Managing incomplete environment information
  - Processing complex test coverage scenarios
  - Dealing with ambiguous code-to-test relationships
  - Handling conflicts in test case templates

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for bug reporting and evidence management
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

A successful implementation of the TestTrack library will meet the following criteria:

1. **Functionality Completeness**:
   - All five key requirements are fully implemented and operational
   - Test case templating supports various test types
   - Bug reporting captures comprehensive environment information
