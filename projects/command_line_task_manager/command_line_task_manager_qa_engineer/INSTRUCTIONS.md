# TermTask for QA Engineers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for QA engineers who need to track test cases and bug reports methodically. This variant focuses on test case templating, bug reporting workflows, evidence management, test coverage visualization, and regression testing coordination to streamline the quality assurance process.

## Persona Description
Jamal performs quality assurance testing across multiple product features and needs to track test cases and bug reports methodically. His primary goal is to associate test tasks with specific features and efficiently document test results with evidence.

## Key Requirements

1. **Test Case Templating System**
   - Create structured test case templates with steps and expected results
   - Track test execution with pass/fail status
   - Support parametrized test cases for different configurations
   - Maintain test case versioning as features evolve
   - This feature is critical because it standardizes test documentation, ensures comprehensive coverage, and enables Jamal to efficiently execute tests with clear expectations and results tracking.

2. **Bug Reporting Workflow**
   - Capture detailed bug information with reproduction steps
   - Automatically collect environment information
   - Generate formatted bug reports for developer handoff
   - Track bug lifecycle from discovery to verification
   - This capability is essential because it streamlines the process of documenting and communicating bugs, ensuring all necessary information is captured at discovery time and tracked through resolution.

3. **Screenshot and Recording Management**
   - Attach visual evidence to test results and bug reports
   - Organize and tag visual artifacts for easy retrieval
   - Compare images for visual regression testing
   - Annotate screenshots to highlight specific issues
   - This feature is vital because visual evidence is crucial for effective bug communication, and efficient management of these assets saves significant time in the QA process.

4. **Test Coverage Visualization**
   - Map test cases to features and components
   - Visualize coverage metrics by product area
   - Identify gaps in test coverage
   - Track coverage trends over time
   - This functionality is critical because it helps Jamal ensure adequate testing across the entire product, prioritize testing efforts, and communicate quality status to stakeholders with clear visualizations.

5. **Regression Test Coordination**
   - Identify related tests needed when code changes occur
   - Automate test suite creation based on impacted areas
   - Schedule and prioritize regression testing
   - Track regression test completion and results
   - This feature is essential because it ensures that code changes don't introduce regressions, optimizes the scope of retesting needed for each change, and prevents quality issues from reaching production.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock test case database for testing template functionality
- Simulated bug reports for testing workflow processing
- Virtual screenshot system for testing image management

- Identify regression test requirements in under 1 second

### Integration Points
- Bug tracking systems (Jira, GitHub Issues, etc.)
- Version control systems for code change tracking
- Continuous integration systems for test execution
- Screenshot and recording capture tools
- Test automation frameworks for result import

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely in command-line environment
- Support for offline test execution and result recording
