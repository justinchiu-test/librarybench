# TestTrack CLI - Command-Line Task Management for QA Professionals

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for QA engineers who need to methodically track test cases and bug reports across multiple product features. The system enables systematic test case management, comprehensive bug reporting, visual evidence capture, and insightful test coverage visualization.

## Persona Description
Jamal performs quality assurance testing across multiple product features and needs to track test cases and bug reports methodically. His primary goal is to associate test tasks with specific features and efficiently document test results with evidence.

## Key Requirements
1. **Test Case Templating**: Implement a sophisticated templating system for test cases with expected results and pass/fail tracking. This feature is critical for Jamal as it ensures consistency across test documentation, standardizes the information captured for each test scenario, and streamlines the creation of comprehensive test suites for new features.

2. **Bug Reporting Workflow**: Create a structured workflow for capturing bug reports with automatic environment information collection. This capability enables Jamal to document issues with complete technical context, ensure all necessary information is captured for developers to reproduce problems, and maintain consistent quality of bug reports across different testers and projects.

3. **Screenshot/Recording Attachment**: Develop functionality to capture and attach visual evidence (screenshots and recordings) to test results and bug reports. This feature allows Jamal to provide clear visual documentation of issues, eliminate ambiguity in bug descriptions, and create a visual record of test results that can be easily referenced by developers and stakeholders.

4. **Test Coverage Visualization**: Build analytics functionality that visualizes test coverage by feature and component. This visualization helps Jamal identify gaps in testing efforts, prioritize testing activities for maximum coverage, and demonstrate testing thoroughness to project stakeholders with clear metrics and visualizations.

5. **Regression Tracking**: Implement intelligence for identifying related tests that should be run when specific code changes occur. This capability enables Jamal to efficiently target regression testing efforts based on code modifications, prioritize tests most likely to uncover regression issues, and maintain quality assurance efficiency as the codebase evolves.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Test template rendering must be verifiable with predefined inputs and expected outputs
- Bug report generation must be testable with simulated environment data
- Media attachment functionality must be testable without actual screenshots/recordings
- Test coverage calculation must be verifiable with predetermined test and feature data
- Regression analysis must be testable with mock code change data
- All components must be unit testable with mock data sources

### Performance Expectations
- Template rendering must complete in <50ms
- Bug report generation with environment capture must complete in <200ms
- The system must handle test suites with 10,000+ test cases efficiently
- Coverage calculation must process large test suites (5,000+ tests) in <10 seconds
- Regression analysis must identify related tests for a given code change in <5 seconds

### Integration Points
- Source code repository for regression analysis
- Environment information capture system
- Screenshot/recording capture mechanism
- Test results database
- Bug tracking system integration
- Code coverage data import/export

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across different operating systems
- All functionality must be accessible via programmatic API without UI components
- Media attachments must be stored efficiently without excessive duplication
- Environment information capture must be configurable for different testing environments
- The system must maintain performance with very large test suites and bug databases

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Test Case Management**: A core module handling CRUD operations for test cases with templating, categorization, and expected result management.

2. **Bug Tracking Engine**: Functionality for capturing, documenting, and tracking bugs with automatic environment information collection and status management.

3. **Evidence Management System**: Components for capturing, storing, and retrieving visual evidence (screenshots and recordings) linked to specific test runs or bug reports.

4. **Coverage Analysis Framework**: Logic for calculating and visualizing test coverage across different dimensions (features, components, requirements).

5. **Regression Intelligence**: Algorithms to analyze code changes and identify potentially affected test cases based on historical data and code organization.

6. **Environment Capture**: Functionality to automatically collect relevant system information, application state, and configuration details during test execution.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Test case creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with template support
- Bug report generation with automatic environment information capture
- Screenshot and recording attachment to test results and bug reports
- Test coverage calculation and analysis by feature and component
- Regression test identification based on code changes
- Environment information capture accuracy and completeness

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete QA workflow from test planning to execution to reporting
- Bug discovery, documentation, and lifecycle management
- Test suite organization for new feature development
- Regression testing for software updates
- Test coverage reporting for stakeholder reviews
- Historical analysis of test effectiveness

### Performance Benchmarks
- Test case operations must complete in <50ms for individual operations
- Bug report generation must handle 100+ reports per minute during intensive testing
- The system must efficiently store and retrieve media attachments up to 10MB in size
- Coverage calculation must handle projects with 1000+ features/components
- Regression analysis must process codebases with 100,000+ lines efficiently

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling incomplete environment information during bug reporting
- Proper management of failed screenshot/recording capture attempts
- Recovery from interrupted test runs with partial results
- Accurate coverage calculation with overlapping or nested features
- Regression analysis with major code refactoring or restructuring
- Handling unusually large media attachments or environment data

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Integration tests must verify all external system interfaces

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system demonstrates effective templating for test cases with expected results tracking.
3. Bug reporting automatically captures relevant environment information.
4. Screenshots and recordings can be attached to test results and bug reports.
5. Test coverage visualization accurately represents testing status by feature and component.
6. Regression tracking correctly identifies tests that should be run based on code changes.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. The implementation provides clear evidence of test results and bug conditions.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
