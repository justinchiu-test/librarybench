# TermTask for Academic Researchers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for academic researchers conducting computational experiments. This variant focuses on research reproducibility through bibliographic reference linking, dataset versioning, computational environment tracking, academic documentation export, and experiment parameter logging.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel conducts computational research requiring complex data processing steps and needs to document her methodology precisely. Her primary goal is to track research tasks with detailed notes and associate analytical steps with specific research questions and datasets.

## Key Requirements

1. **Bibliographic Reference Management**
   - Link tasks to academic sources and papers
   - Import citations from BibTeX, RIS, and DOI
   - Associate specific claims or methods with research tasks
   - Generate bibliography for completed task sequences
   - This feature is critical because it allows Dr. Patel to maintain scientific rigor by connecting each research task to its theoretical foundation in the literature, ensuring all work is properly attributed and substantiated.

2. **Dataset Version Control**
   - Track which data version was used for specific analyses
   - Record dataset metadata and provenance information
   - Link analysis results back to source datasets
   - Support for dataset checksums and validation
   - This capability is essential because data reproducibility depends on precise tracking of which dataset version was used for each analysis, allowing Dr. Patel to recreate results exactly and trace unexpected outcomes to their data source.

3. **Computational Environment Snapshots**
   - Document system state for reproducibility
   - Capture package versions, environment variables, and configurations
   - Support for containerization integration (Docker, Singularity)
   - Clone environments for experiment replication
   - This feature is vital because computational research reproducibility requires detailed knowledge of the exact computational environment, allowing Dr. Patel to recreate her analysis setup precisely and share reproducible workflows with colleagues.

4. **Academic Documentation Export**
   - Generate methods sections for publications in academic formats
   - Export task sequences as reproducible protocols
   - Support LaTeX, Markdown, and plain text outputs
   - Include statistical parameters and processing details
   - This functionality is critical because it automates the tedious and error-prone process of documenting computational methods for publication, ensuring Dr. Patel's methods sections are complete, accurate, and sufficiently detailed for peer review.

5. **Experiment Tracking with Parameters**
   - Log experimental parameters for each analysis run
   - Track variations between experiment iterations
   - Record result metrics and statistical outputs
   - Visualize parameter impact on research outcomes
   - This feature is essential because it creates a systematic record of experimental conditions and outcomes, allowing Dr. Patel to optimize her research methodology and demonstrate the robustness of findings through methodical parameter variation.
