# ResearchFlow - An Academic Researcher's Task Management Library

## Overview
ResearchFlow is a specialized task management library designed specifically for academic researchers who conduct computational research requiring complex data processing steps. This library provides robust APIs for tracking research tasks with detailed notes, linking tasks to academic citations, versioning datasets, capturing computational environments, exporting methods for publications, and logging experiment details with parameters and results.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel conducts computational research requiring complex data processing steps and needs to document her methodology precisely. Her primary goal is to track research tasks with detailed notes and associate analytical steps with specific research questions and datasets.

## Key Requirements
1. **Bibliographic Reference Linking**: The library must provide functionality to associate research tasks with academic sources including papers, books, and online resources. This is critical for Dr. Patel to maintain complete scientific provenance by linking analytical methods and insights to their academic origins, supporting reproducible research and proper attribution.

2. **Dataset Versioning Integration**: The system should support tracking which data version was used for each analysis task. This feature is essential for Dr. Patel to maintain experimental reproducibility by clearly associating analysis results with specific dataset versions, ensuring that findings can be validated and experiments replicated.

3. **Computational Environment Snapshots**: The library must capture and store the system state, package versions, and computational parameters for each analysis task. This capability is crucial for Dr. Patel to document the exact computational conditions under which analyses were performed, enabling others to recreate the same environment for verification.

4. **Academic Markdown Export**: The system needs to generate formatted methodology documentation suitable for inclusion in academic publications. This functionality is vital for Dr. Patel to efficiently translate her documented task sequences into properly formatted methods sections that meet publication standards.

5. **Experiment Tracking**: The library must provide comprehensive logging of experiment parameters, variations, and results associated with research tasks. This feature is important for Dr. Patel to maintain a systematic record of all experimental conditions and outcomes, facilitating the comparison of results across different parameter settings.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock data
  - Bibliographic linking must be testable with sample citation data
  - Dataset versioning functionality must support simulated datasets
  - Environment snapshots must be captured and verified in test environments
  - Markdown export must be verifiable against standard academic formats

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Task creation and retrieval < 50ms
  - Reference linking operations < 100ms
  - Environment snapshots < 200ms
  - Markdown export generation < 300ms
  - The system must handle at least 10,000 research tasks with no performance degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - Bibliographic management systems (BibTeX, Zotero, Mendeley APIs)
  - Dataset version control systems (Git LFS, DVC)
  - Computational environment management (conda, venv, Docker)
  - Academic document preparation systems (LaTeX, Markdown)
  - Experimental parameter logging frameworks

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must function in air-gapped research environments
  - All data must be stored in open, non-proprietary formats
  - Storage efficiency for large experimental records
  - Minimal dependencies on external services
  - Must support cross-platform operation for collaboration

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Research Task Management**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete research tasks with detailed metadata
   - Support for task categorization by research question or hypothesis
   - Hierarchical organization of tasks into experiments and projects
   - Comprehensive note-taking capabilities with support for scientific notation

2. **Citation Management**: 
   - Link tasks to bibliographic references in standard formats
   - Import and export citation data to/from common reference managers
   - Track influence of specific references on research methods
   - Support for DOI resolution and metadata retrieval

3. **Dataset Versioning**: 
   - Record dataset versions used for each analysis task
   - Track dataset transformations and preprocessing steps
   - Support for dataset checksums and integrity verification
   - Link analysis results to specific data versions

4. **Environment Documentation**: 
   - Capture system information and computational resources
   - Record package versions and dependencies
   - Document configuration parameters for reproducibility
   - Support for containerization information

5. **Methods Documentation**: 
   - Generate structured methodology descriptions
   - Export task sequences as academic markdown
   - Support for LaTeX-compatible formatting
   - Include relevant citations automatically

6. **Experiment Tracking**: 
   - Log experimental parameters and configurations
   - Record results and performance metrics
   - Support for multiple experimental runs with parameter variations
   - Facilitate comparison between experimental conditions

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - Bibliographic reference linking and citation management
  - Dataset version tracking and association
  - Computational environment capture
  - Markdown export for methods sections
  - Experiment parameter and result logging

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Creating research tasks linked to specific papers
  - Associating analysis tasks with dataset versions
  - Capturing computational environment for a complex analysis
  - Generating a methods section for publication
  - Logging and comparing results across parameter variations

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Task retrieval with associated references < 50ms
  - Dataset version linking < 70ms
  - Environment snapshot generation < 200ms
  - Markdown export for complex methods < 300ms
  - Experiment comparison across multiple parameter sets < 150ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling invalid or incomplete bibliographic data
  - Managing missing dataset versions
  - Recovering from failed environment snapshots
  - Dealing with complex formatting in markdown export
  - Handling very large experimental parameter spaces

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for core data model and export functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
