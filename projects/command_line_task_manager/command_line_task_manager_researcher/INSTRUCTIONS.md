# ResearchTrack CLI - Command-Line Task Management for Academic Research

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for academic researchers conducting computational research. The system enables meticulous tracking of research tasks with detailed notes, associates analytical steps with specific research questions and datasets, and provides comprehensive documentation capabilities to ensure research reproducibility.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel conducts computational research requiring complex data processing steps and needs to document her methodology precisely. Her primary goal is to track research tasks with detailed notes and associate analytical steps with specific research questions and datasets.

## Key Requirements
1. **Bibliographic Reference Linking**: Implement a sophisticated system to associate tasks with academic sources, citations, and literature. This feature is critical for Dr. Patel as it allows her to maintain clear connections between research activities and their theoretical foundations, track which papers influenced specific methodological decisions, and generate properly formatted citations for methods sections in publications.

2. **Dataset Versioning Integration**: Create functionality to track which data version was used for each analysis task. This capability enables Dr. Patel to maintain a precise record of data provenance for each analysis step, reproduce results using the exact same datasets months or years later, and document dataset lineage throughout the research process for publication.

3. **Computational Environment Snapshots**: Develop a mechanism to document the complete system state for reproducibility, including software versions, dependencies, and configurations. This feature allows Dr. Patel to capture the exact computational environment used for analyses, ensure experiments can be reproduced in identical conditions, and satisfy increasing journal requirements for computational reproducibility.

4. **Academic Markdown Export**: Build export functionality that generates properly formatted methods sections for academic publications. This capability enables Dr. Patel to automatically document her methodology in a publication-ready format, save significant time in manuscript preparation, and ensure methodological details are complete and accurate in publications.

5. **Experiment Tracking**: Implement detailed tracking of experimental parameters, variations, and result logging. This system helps Dr. Patel organize different experimental conditions and their outcomes, identify patterns across multiple experiment runs, and maintain a comprehensive record of all research activities for future reference and publication.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Bibliographic reference handling must be testable with standard citation formats
- Dataset version tracking must be verifiable with simulated dataset changes
- Environment snapshot capture must be testable on different systems
- Markdown export must produce consistent output given identical inputs
- Experiment parameter tracking must be verifiable with complex parameter sets
- All components must be unit testable with mock research data

### Performance Expectations
- The system must handle research projects with 1000+ analysis tasks
- Bibliographic database operations must efficiently manage 10,000+ references
- Environment snapshots must be generated in <5 seconds
- Markdown export must process large methods sections (10,000+ words) in <3 seconds
- Experiment tracking must handle at least 1,000 distinct parameter combinations

### Integration Points
- Reference management systems (BibTeX, EndNote, Zotero)
- Dataset version control systems (Git, DVC)
- Computational environment managers (conda, venv, Docker)
- Markdown processing and academic formatting tools
- Experiment parameter management systems
- Statistical analysis packages

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across different operating systems
- All functionality must be accessible via programmatic API without UI components
- Citation format handling must comply with major academic style guides
- Environment snapshots must be compact yet complete
- The system must maintain consistent performance with large research projects

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Research Task Management**: A core module handling CRUD operations for research tasks with detailed metadata, notes, and associations to research questions.

2. **Bibliographic System**: Functionality for managing, linking, and formatting academic references associated with research tasks, supporting major citation formats.

3. **Dataset Versioning**: Components for tracking dataset versions, including provenance, transformations, and usage across different analysis tasks.

4. **Environment Documentation**: Logic for capturing, storing, and reproducing computational environment details, including package versions, configurations, and system information.

5. **Academic Export Engine**: Tools for generating properly formatted academic content from task data, with support for different journal formats and citation styles.

6. **Experiment Tracking Framework**: A structured system for defining experimental parameters, tracking variations, and recording results with appropriate metadata.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Research task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with comprehensive metadata
- Bibliographic reference management with proper formatting
- Dataset version tracking with provenance information
- Computational environment snapshot capture and verification
- Academic markdown export with proper formatting
- Experiment parameter tracking and result association

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete research workflow from literature review to data analysis to publication
- Reproducing previous analyses with identical conditions
- Documenting methodology for publication
- Exploring variations in experimental parameters
- Maintaining provenance of research insights
- Tracking the evolution of research questions and approaches

### Performance Benchmarks
- Task operations must complete in <50ms for individual operations
- Bibliographic operations must efficiently handle libraries with 10,000+ references
- Dataset versioning must handle datasets up to 100GB (metadata only, not storage)
- Environment snapshots must be generated in <5 seconds
- Markdown export must process at least 100 pages of content per second
- Experiment tracking must handle at least 100 parameter variations per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling conflicting or inconsistent bibliographic information
- Recovery from incomplete environment captures
- Proper management of large or complex datasets
- Maintaining accuracy with frequent changes to research direction
- Appropriate handling of unusual citation formats
- Graceful degradation with extremely large research projects

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Format verification for exported academic content

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system effectively links research tasks to bibliographic references with proper citation formatting.
3. Dataset versions are accurately tracked and associated with specific analysis tasks.
4. Computational environment details are captured with sufficient detail for reproducibility.
5. Academic markdown export generates properly formatted methods sections for publications.
6. Experiment tracking successfully manages parameters, variations, and results.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. The implementation supports the complete research workflow from planning to publication.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
