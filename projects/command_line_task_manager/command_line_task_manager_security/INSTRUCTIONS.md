# SecTasker - A Security Analyst's Task Management Library

## Overview
SecTasker is a specialized task management library designed specifically for security analysts who conduct security audits and penetration testing. This library provides robust APIs for documenting security findings with secure evidence storage, assessing vulnerability severity using standardized scoring, tracking remediation workflows, mapping findings to compliance requirements, and generating security reports with appropriate redaction capabilities.

## Persona Description
Trevor conducts security audits and penetration testing, needing to methodically track security findings and remediation tasks. His primary goal is to document security vulnerabilities with proper evidence and track verification of fixes.

## Key Requirements
1. **Secure Evidence Storage**: The library must provide secure storage for vulnerability documentation, including screenshots, logs, and exploit code. This is critical for Trevor to maintain confidentiality of sensitive security findings while preserving the necessary evidence for verification and remediation, with appropriate access controls and encryption.

2. **CVSS Scoring Integration**: The system should support standardized Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) assessment for consistent security severity classification. This feature is essential for Trevor to objectively quantify the severity of identified vulnerabilities using industry-standard metrics, facilitating prioritization and communication with stakeholders.

3. **Remediation Workflow**: The library must offer a structured process to track vulnerability remediation with mandatory verification steps. This functionality is crucial for Trevor to ensure that each identified security issue progresses through proper remediation stages, culminating in verification that confirms the vulnerability has been properly addressed.

4. **Compliance Mapping**: The system needs to associate security findings with specific regulatory requirements and compliance frameworks. This feature is vital for Trevor to demonstrate how identified vulnerabilities impact compliance status across various standards (NIST, ISO, GDPR, etc.), supporting audit documentation and risk management.

5. **Security Report Generation**: The library must support producing comprehensive security reports with selective redaction capabilities for sensitive details. This capability is important for Trevor to create appropriate documentation for different audiences (executives, developers, auditors) while protecting confidential vulnerability information.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock security data
  - Evidence storage must be testable without compromising security
  - CVSS calculation must be verifiable against standard examples
  - Workflow transitions must be comprehensively testable
  - Report generation and redaction must be thoroughly verified

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Vulnerability creation and retrieval < 50ms
  - Evidence storage and retrieval < 100ms
  - CVSS score calculation < 30ms
  - Workflow state transitions < 20ms
  - Report generation < 500ms for comprehensive security assessments
  - The system must handle at least 10,000 security findings with no performance degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - Secure storage systems for evidence
  - CVSS calculation libraries and APIs
  - Workflow and ticketing systems
  - Compliance frameworks and documentation
  - Reporting engines with redaction capabilities
  - Security scanning and testing tools

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All vulnerability data must be encrypted at rest
  - Access control must be granular and auditable
  - Evidence must be stored with cryptographic integrity verification
  - Compliance mappings must be regularly updatable
  - Report generation must support air-gapped environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Security Finding Management**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete security findings with appropriate metadata
   - Support for finding categorization, prioritization, and status tracking
   - Association with affected systems, components, and assets
   - Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities

2. **Evidence Management**: 
   - Securely store and retrieve vulnerability evidence
   - Support for various evidence types (screenshots, logs, code snippets)
   - Implement access controls and encryption
   - Maintain evidence integrity and chain of custody

3. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Calculate CVSS scores based on standard metrics
   - Support multiple CVSS versions (v2, v3.0, v3.1)
   - Generate vector strings for score reproducibility
   - Translate scores into organizational severity levels

4. **Remediation Tracking**: 
   - Track vulnerability status through remediation lifecycle
   - Define and enforce verification requirements
   - Support for remediation approval workflows
   - Maintain history of remediation attempts

5. **Compliance Management**: 
   - Map findings to regulatory requirements
   - Track compliance impact across frameworks
   - Support for custom compliance mapping rules
   - Generate compliance status reports

6. **Report Generation**: 
   - Create structured security reports
   - Support multiple audience-specific templates
   - Implement selective information redaction
   - Export to various formats (PDF, HTML, JSON)

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Security finding creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - Evidence storage, encryption, and retrieval
  - CVSS score calculation and vector generation
  - Remediation workflow transitions and verification
  - Compliance mapping accuracy
  - Report generation with redaction

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Documenting a critical vulnerability with supporting evidence
  - Calculating CVSS scores for various vulnerability types
  - Tracking a finding through complete remediation lifecycle
  - Mapping findings to multiple compliance frameworks
  - Generating security reports for different stakeholders
  - Managing sensitive information with appropriate redaction

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Finding retrieval with evidence < 100ms
  - CVSS calculation < 30ms
  - Workflow transitions < 20ms
  - Compliance impact assessment < 50ms
  - Report generation < 500ms for comprehensive assessments

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling very large evidence files
  - Managing complex CVSS edge cases
  - Dealing with interrupted remediation workflows
  - Processing findings that impact multiple compliance frameworks
  - Generating reports with conflicting redaction requirements

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 95% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for security-critical components
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
