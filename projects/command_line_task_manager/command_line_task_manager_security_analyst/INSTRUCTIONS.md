# TermTask for Security Analysts

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for security analysts who conduct security audits and penetration testing. This variant focuses on secure evidence storage, vulnerability severity assessment, remediation workflows, compliance mapping, and secure reporting to streamline security operations while maintaining strict confidentiality and data protection.

## Persona Description
Trevor conducts security audits and penetration testing, needing to methodically track security findings and remediation tasks. His primary goal is to document security vulnerabilities with proper evidence and track verification of fixes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Secure Evidence Storage**
   - Encrypt sensitive vulnerability documentation
   - Support for secure screenshots and file attachments
   - Implement access controls for different evidence sensitivity levels
   - Audit logging for all evidence access and modifications
   - This feature is critical because security findings often include sensitive information that could be exploited if exposed, requiring Trevor to maintain strict confidentiality while still documenting vulnerabilities thoroughly.

2. **CVSS Scoring Integration**
   - Calculate and track CVSS scores for vulnerabilities
   - Support for both CVSS v3.1 and legacy scoring
   - Generate severity ratings based on CVSS metrics
   - Prioritize findings based on calculated risk levels
   - This capability is essential because standardized severity scoring enables objective risk assessment, consistent prioritization of remediation efforts, and clear communication of security impact to stakeholders.

3. **Remediation Workflow Management**
   - Track vulnerability from discovery through remediation
   - Implement verification steps for fix confirmation
   - Manage remediation deadlines based on severity
   - Document mitigation strategies and compensating controls
   - This feature is vital because it creates accountability for security fixes, ensures vulnerabilities don't remain open indefinitely, and provides a systematic process for verifying that remediation is effective.

4. **Compliance Framework Mapping**
   - Link findings to regulatory requirements (GDPR, PCI, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Track compliance status across multiple frameworks
   - Generate compliance gap analyses and reports
   - Map remediation activities to compliance obligations
   - This functionality is critical because it connects security findings to compliance requirements, helps prioritize remediation based on regulatory impact, and streamlines compliance reporting and audit preparation.

5. **Security Reporting with Redaction**
   - Generate security reports with appropriate detail levels
   - Implement redaction options for sensitive details
   - Support multiple report formats for different audiences
   - Include executive summaries and technical details
   - This feature is essential because effective security communication requires different detail levels for different audiences, and automated redaction ensures sensitive information is protected while still conveying necessary security information.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock vulnerability database for testing CVSS scoring
- Simulated evidence files for testing secure storage
- Workflow simulation for testing remediation tracking
- Sample compliance frameworks for testing mapping features
- Report template validation for testing redaction capabilities

### Performance Expectations
- Support for storing and retrieving 10,000+ pieces of evidence
- CVSS calculation in under 100ms per vulnerability
- Handle 1,000+ concurrent remediation workflows
- Map findings to 20+ compliance frameworks simultaneously
- Generate redacted reports for 500+ findings in under 10 seconds

### Integration Points
- Evidence capture tools (screenshots, network captures)
- Vulnerability databases (NVD, vendor advisories)
- Issue tracking systems for remediation
- Compliance management frameworks
- Security reporting and distribution systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely in command-line environment
- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- Air-gap operation support for secure environments
- No cloud dependencies for core functionality
- Must maintain data confidentiality even during crash recovery

   - Audit all evidence access and modifications

3. **Vulnerability Assessment Engine**
   - Implement CVSS scoring algorithms
   - Calculate risk levels based on technical factors
   - Track scoring changes as more information is discovered
   - Generate severity ratings for prioritization
   - Support for custom scoring extensions

4. **Remediation Tracking Framework**
   - Define remediation workflows and states
   - Track remediation progress and deadlines
   - Implement verification requirements and testing
   - Document fix approaches and alternatives
   - Manage exceptions and compensating controls

5. **Compliance Management System**
   - Maintain compliance requirement database
   - Map findings to compliance controls
   - Track compliance status by framework
   - Generate compliance gap analyses
   - Support for custom compliance frameworks

6. **Reporting Engine**
   - Generate security reports from findings
   - Implement selective redaction capabilities
   - Support multiple output formats and templates
   - Create audience-specific report versions
   - Secure report distribution and access controls

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Evidence is properly encrypted and access-controlled
- CVSS scoring accurately calculates severity levels
- Remediation workflows correctly track fixes through verification
- Compliance mapping correctly links findings to requirements
- Reports correctly redact sensitive information based on audience

### Critical User Scenarios
- Documenting a new security vulnerability with evidence
- Assessing the severity of a finding using CVSS
- Tracking a critical vulnerability through remediation
- Mapping findings to compliance requirements for an audit
- Generating different report versions for technical and executive audiences

### Performance Benchmarks
- Evidence storage and retrieval operations under 1 second
- CVSS calculations for 100+ vulnerabilities in under 2 seconds
- Remediation tracking updates in real-time (< 500ms)
