# SysOps Task Tracker - A System Administrator's Task Management Library

## Overview
SysOps Task Tracker is a specialized task management library designed specifically for system administrators who need to track routine maintenance alongside urgent issues, document system changes for compliance, and efficiently manage server operations. This library provides robust APIs for tracking operations tasks, scheduling maintenance windows, documenting system changes, and managing critical issues with proper escalation paths.

## Persona Description
Olivia manages server infrastructure for an enterprise and needs to track routine maintenance tasks alongside urgent issues. Her primary goal is to prioritize operations work and document system changes for compliance and team knowledge sharing.

## Key Requirements
1. **Automated Server Health Monitoring Tasks**: The system should provide APIs to integrate with server monitoring tools to automatically create tasks based on system status. This is critical for Olivia to ensure that health issues are immediately captured as actionable tasks without manual entry.

2. **Change Management Documentation**: The library must support comprehensive change tracking with before/after state recording for all system modifications. This is essential for Olivia's compliance requirements and provides a detailed audit trail for all infrastructure changes.

3. **Maintenance Window Scheduling**: The system requires robust scheduling capabilities that can detect conflicts between maintenance tasks and critical operations. This feature is crucial as Olivia needs to plan maintenance work while minimizing service disruptions.

4. **Command History Integration**: The library must provide functionality to record and associate exact commands executed with specific tasks. This is vital for Olivia to maintain accurate documentation of all operations performed and enables knowledge sharing across the team.

5. **Critical Task Escalation Pathways**: The system needs to support escalation workflows for critical tasks, including notification rules and urgency tracking. This is essential for Olivia to ensure that high-priority issues receive proper attention and are addressed within required SLAs.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be fully testable in isolation with mocked dependencies
  - Server health monitoring integrations must be testable without actual server connections
  - Time-based functions must support time manipulation for testing scheduled tasks
  - Command execution tracking must be verifiable without executing real commands

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Task creation and retrieval operations must complete in under 50ms
  - The system must handle at least 10,000 tasks with no significant performance degradation
  - Scheduled task checks must efficiently process large numbers of maintenance windows
  - Search and filtering operations must return results in under 100ms

- **Integration Points**:
  - Integration with monitoring systems via API interfaces
  - Support for command shell history access and recording
  - Scheduling system for maintenance windows
  - Notification systems for escalation pathways
  - Export capabilities for compliance documentation

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No direct execution of system commands (only recording of commands)
  - Must work in environments with restricted network access
  - All sensitive operations must be properly logged for audit purposes
  - Data storage must support encryption for sensitive operational details
  - Must function on various Linux distributions

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Management System**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks with appropriate metadata
   - Support for task prioritization, categorization, and status tracking
   - Association of tasks with servers, services, or infrastructure components
   - Time tracking for task execution and completion

2. **Health Check Integration**: 
   - APIs to create tasks from monitoring tool alerts
   - Support for threshold-based task creation
   - Automated priority assignment based on severity
   - Duplicate detection to prevent alert storms

3. **Change Management**: 
   - Record system state before and after changes
   - Support for rollback plans in task documentation
   - Approval workflow management
   - Change impact assessment tracking

4. **Maintenance Scheduling**: 
   - Define maintenance windows with time constraints
   - Detect conflicts between scheduled maintenance
   - Resource allocation tracking to prevent overcommitment
   - Recurring maintenance task management

5. **Command Tracking**: 
   - Associate executed commands with specific tasks
   - Record command output and success/failure status
   - Support for command templating for common operations
   - Searchable command history by task or resource

6. **Escalation Management**: 
   - Define escalation paths for critical tasks
   - Set up notification rules and urgency levels
   - Track response times against SLA requirements
   - Support for escalation delegation and handoff

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - Health check integration and task generation
  - Change management documentation workflow
  - Maintenance window scheduling and conflict detection
  - Command history recording and retrieval
  - Escalation pathway functionality

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Creating tasks from simulated server alerts
  - Scheduling overlapping maintenance windows and detecting conflicts
  - Documenting system changes with before/after states
  - Escalating critical tasks through defined notification paths
  - Recording and retrieving command history for specific tasks

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Task creation speed under load (min 100 tasks/second)
  - Query performance with 10,000+ historical tasks
  - Scheduling conflict detection with 1,000+ maintenance windows
  - Command history search performance across large datasets

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of malformed monitoring data
  - Conflict resolution for overlapping high-priority maintenance
  - Recovery from interrupted change management workflows
  - Graceful handling of notification system failures
  - Proper error handling for command history recording failures

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for critical components (scheduling, escalation)
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

1. **Functionality Completeness**:
   - All five key requirements are fully implemented and operational
   - The system can create tasks from monitoring data
