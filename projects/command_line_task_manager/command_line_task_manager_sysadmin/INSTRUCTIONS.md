# TermTask for System Administrators

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for system administrators who manage enterprise server infrastructure. This variant focuses on server health monitoring, change management documentation, maintenance scheduling, command history tracking, and critical task escalation to streamline operations and ensure system reliability.

## Persona Description
Olivia manages server infrastructure for an enterprise and needs to track routine maintenance tasks alongside urgent issues. Her primary goal is to prioritize operations work and document system changes for compliance and team knowledge sharing.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automated Server Health Monitoring**
   - Create tasks based on server health status
   - Integrate with monitoring systems (Nagios, Prometheus, etc.)
   - Prioritize tasks based on system criticality and alert severity
   - Group related alerts into single actionable tasks
   - This feature is critical because it transforms passive monitoring alerts into actionable work items, ensuring that system issues are addressed proactively and preventing critical outages through early intervention.

2. **Change Management Documentation**
   - Record before/after system states for all changes
   - Document approval workflows and sign-offs
   - Capture configuration diffs and rollback instructions
   - Link changes to business justifications and tickets
   - This capability is essential because it creates a comprehensive audit trail of all system modifications, satisfying compliance requirements and providing crucial context for troubleshooting when issues arise following changes.

3. **Maintenance Window Scheduling**
   - Schedule and track system maintenance windows
   - Detect scheduling conflicts across servers and services
   - Send notifications for upcoming maintenance activities
   - Track maintenance completion status and outcomes
   - This feature is vital because it helps Olivia coordinate complex maintenance activities across interdependent systems, preventing service disruptions from conflicting changes and ensuring all stakeholders are informed of planned downtime.

4. **Command History Integration**
   - Record exact operations performed on systems
   - Associate commands with specific tasks and servers
   - Enable command replay for recurring operations
   - Search historical commands by server, task, or outcome
   - This functionality is critical because it documents precisely what actions were taken during system changes, creating institutional knowledge that can be leveraged for future similar tasks and for training new team members.

5. **Critical Task Escalation Pathways**
   - Define escalation paths for critical issues
   - Implement notification rules based on task priority and age
   - Track response times and SLA compliance
   - Support on-call rotation integration
   - This feature is essential because it ensures urgent issues receive appropriate attention, maintains accountability for critical systems, and provides clear procedures for escalating problems when timely resolution is imperative.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock monitoring system integration for testing alert processing
- Simulated system state for testing change documentation
- Virtual calendar system for testing maintenance scheduling
- Command execution simulation for testing history tracking
- Notification system mocking for testing escalation pathways

### Performance Expectations
- Support processing 100+ monitoring alerts per minute
- Handle 1000+ servers and services in the infrastructure registry
- Maintenance scheduler should handle 500+ scheduled windows
- Command history should store and query 1,000,000+ command entries
- Escalation system should process notifications in under 1 second

### Integration Points
- Monitoring systems (Nagios, Prometheus, Zabbix, etc.)
- Configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet)
- Ticketing systems (ServiceNow, Jira)
- Shell history and command execution
- Notification systems (email, SMS, chat platforms)

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely in command-line environment
- Cannot interfere with system operations or performance
- Must function in air-gapped or restricted network environments
- Minimal dependency requirements for security-conscious environments
- Support for operating across multiple security zones

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the TermTask system for system administrators includes:

1. **Task Management Engine**
   - Create, read, update, and delete operations tasks
   - Organize tasks by priority, status, system, and owner
   - Support for task dependencies and critical paths
   - Customizable workflows for different types of operations
   - Persistence with high reliability guarantees

2. **Server Health Monitoring Integration**
   - Connect to monitoring system APIs
   - Process and normalize alerts from multiple sources
   - Convert technical alerts to actionable tasks
   - Implement deduplication and correlation
   - Track historical alert patterns

3. **Change Management System**
   - Document proposed changes with impact analysis
   - Capture pre-change system state snapshots
   - Record post-change verification steps
   - Manage change approval workflows
   - Archive change documentation for compliance

4. **Maintenance Planning Framework**
   - Define maintenance window parameters
   - Check for conflicts across systems and dependencies
   - Schedule recurring maintenance activities
   - Track maintenance execution and outcomes
   - Notify stakeholders of scheduled activities

5. **Command Management System**
   - Capture shell commands and execution context
   - Categorize commands by purpose and target system
   - Associate commands with specific tasks
   - Enable search and replay of command sequences
   - Analyze command patterns and effectiveness

6. **Escalation Management Engine**
   - Define escalation rules and pathways
   - Implement SLA monitoring and notifications
   - Track incident response metrics
   - Integrate with on-call rotation systems
   - Generate incident response reports

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Monitoring alerts correctly create appropriate tasks
- Change management captures complete system state information
- Maintenance scheduling properly detects and prevents conflicts
- Command history accurately records all operational commands
- Escalation pathways properly trigger notifications based on rules

### Critical User Scenarios
- Responding to a critical system alert
- Documenting and executing a complex system change
- Scheduling a maintenance window across interdependent systems
- Using historical command information to troubleshoot an issue
- Escalating an unresolved critical issue through proper channels

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process 50+ monitoring alerts per second
- Store and retrieve change records for 10,000+ changes
- Schedule conflict detection across 1,000+ maintenance windows in under 1 second
- Command history search across 1,000,000+ entries in under 2 seconds
- Escalation pathway evaluation and notification in under 500ms

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling alert storms during major outages
- Managing incomplete change documentation
- Rescheduling maintenance after conflicts or failures
- Recovering from interrupted command sequences
