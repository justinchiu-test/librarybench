# SysOps-TaskTrack - Command-Line Task Management for System Administrators

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for system administrators managing enterprise infrastructure. The system enables tracking of routine maintenance tasks alongside urgent issues, prioritization of operations work, and comprehensive documentation of system changes for compliance and knowledge sharing.

## Persona Description
Olivia manages server infrastructure for an enterprise and needs to track routine maintenance tasks alongside urgent issues. Her primary goal is to prioritize operations work and document system changes for compliance and team knowledge sharing.

## Key Requirements
1. **Automated Server Health Checks**: Implement a mechanism to create tasks based on system status by integrating with monitoring platforms. This feature is critical for Olivia as it eliminates manual task creation for routine health issues, ensures critical system problems are automatically tracked as tasks, and provides seamless integration between monitoring alerts and administrative workflow.

2. **Change Management Documentation**: Create a structured framework for recording system states before and after changes, including configurations and relevant metrics. This capability allows Olivia to maintain detailed records of all infrastructure modifications, satisfy audit and compliance requirements with comprehensive change logs, and provide team members with complete context for troubleshooting and knowledge transfer.

3. **Maintenance Window Scheduling**: Develop intelligent scheduling functionality that manages maintenance periods with conflict detection. This feature enables Olivia to plan system maintenance with awareness of business-critical periods and dependencies, prevent overlapping maintenance activities that could compound risk, and communicate planned downtime to stakeholders with clear visibility of timing and impact.

4. **Command History Integration**: Build functionality that records and associates exact operations performed with specific tasks. This integration helps Olivia maintain precise documentation of commands used for system changes, create a searchable repository of proven solutions for common issues, and enable junior administrators to learn from past interventions.

5. **Escalation Pathways**: Implement a sophisticated notification system for critical tasks with configurable escalation routes. This capability ensures critical issues receive appropriate attention based on severity and time thresholds, maintains clear accountability for urgent problems as they progress through resolution stages, and prevents important tasks from being overlooked during high-activity periods.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Server health check integration must be testable with mock monitoring data
- Change documentation components must be verifiable with sample configuration files
- Maintenance scheduling must be testable with predefined calendar scenarios
- Command recording must work across different shell environments (bash, zsh, PowerShell)
- Escalation logic must be fully testable without sending actual notifications
- All components must be unit testable with appropriate mocking

### Performance Expectations
- Health check integrations must handle 1000+ servers with sub-second response
- Change documentation must efficiently store and retrieve changes to large configuration files
- Maintenance scheduling must process calendars with 10,000+ entries in <3 seconds
- Command history must support searching through 100,000+ historical commands in <2 seconds
- Escalation system must process 100+ parallel notification paths without significant latency

### Integration Points
- Monitoring system APIs (Nagios, Prometheus, Zabbix, etc.)
- Configuration management databases
- Enterprise calendar systems
- Shell environment and command history
- Notification systems (email, SMS, messaging platforms)
- Authentication and authorization systems for escalation control

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across different operating systems
- All functionality must be accessible via programmatic API without UI components
- The system must support enterprise security requirements including least privilege
- Sensitive information must be handled appropriately in logs and documentation
- Performance must scale with enterprise infrastructure sizes

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Task Management Engine**: A core module handling CRUD operations for system administration tasks with priority levels, categories, and statuses appropriate for IT operations.

2. **Monitoring Integration**: Components for connecting with monitoring systems to automatically generate tasks based on alerts and system status.

3. **Change Documentation System**: A framework for capturing, storing, and retrieving system state information before and after administrative actions.

4. **Maintenance Scheduler**: Logic for planning and coordinating maintenance windows with conflict detection and dependency awareness.

5. **Command Management**: Functionality to record, associate, and search shell commands related to specific tasks and resolutions.

6. **Escalation Framework**: A configurable system for escalating critical issues through appropriate notification channels based on severity and timing.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with sysadmin-specific metadata
- Monitoring system integration with accurate task generation
- Change documentation with comprehensive before/after state recording
- Maintenance scheduling with correct conflict detection
- Command recording and association with tasks
- Escalation path logic with proper notification targeting

### Critical User Scenarios
- Responding to system outages with proper task tracking and escalation
- Planning and executing coordinated maintenance across multiple systems
- Documenting complex system changes for compliance and knowledge sharing
- Managing routine maintenance alongside urgent issues
- Handling escalation of critical issues through appropriate channels
- Training new team members with historical task and command data

### Performance Benchmarks
- Task operations must complete in <50ms for individual operations
- Monitoring integration must handle 100+ simultaneous alerts
- Change documentation must efficiently store differences in configurations up to 10MB
- Maintenance scheduling must handle calendars with 10,000+ entries
- Command history must efficiently search through 100,000+ historical commands
- Escalation system must process notification decisions in <100ms

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling monitoring system unavailability
- Maintaining accurate state documentation during failed or partial changes
- Resolving complex maintenance scheduling conflicts
- Recovering from interrupted command recording
- Proper behavior when escalation paths are invalid or unavailable
- Graceful degradation under extremely high task volumes during major incidents

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Security controls must be explicitly verified

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system successfully integrates with monitoring platforms to create tasks automatically.
3. Change documentation comprehensively records system states before and after modifications.
4. Maintenance scheduling correctly identifies and prevents conflicts.
5. Command history is accurately recorded and associated with relevant tasks.
6. Escalation pathways properly route notifications based on severity and timing.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. The implementation adheres to enterprise security and compliance requirements.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:

- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
