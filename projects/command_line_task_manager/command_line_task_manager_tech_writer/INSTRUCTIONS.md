# DocTask CLI - Command-Line Task Management for Technical Documentation

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for technical writers creating documentation for complex software systems. The system enables tracking of content creation tasks across multiple documents and platforms, organization of documentation tasks by product component, and comprehensive tracking of dependencies between related content pieces.

## Persona Description
Sam creates documentation for complex software systems and needs to track content creation tasks across multiple documents and platforms. His primary goal is to organize documentation tasks by product component and track dependencies between related content pieces.

## Key Requirements
1. **Documentation Structure Viewer**: Implement a hierarchical visualization system that shows content organization, relationships, and identifies gaps in documentation coverage. This feature is critical for Sam as it provides a clear overview of the entire documentation ecosystem, helps identify missing or outdated content areas that require attention, and aids in planning comprehensive documentation that covers all product components.

2. **Screenshot/Image Capture Integration**: Create functionality to capture, organize, and embed visual content directly within task completion workflows. This capability enables Sam to efficiently document user interfaces and processes with visual evidence, maintain consistent image quality and formatting across documentation, and streamline the often time-consuming process of creating and managing documentation visuals.

3. **Style Guide Compliance Checking**: Develop automated verification of completed documentation against organizational style standards and writing guidelines. This feature allows Sam to ensure consistency across all documentation products, identify and correct style issues before publication, and maintain high-quality standards even when multiple writers contribute to the documentation set.

4. **Translation Tracking**: Implement a system for managing multilingual documentation with status tracking for each language variant. This functionality helps Sam coordinate translation efforts across multiple languages, maintain awareness of which content requires updating in each language when source documents change, and ensure consistent documentation availability across all supported languages.

5. **Reader Feedback Integration**: Build a mechanism that converts user questions and feedback into actionable documentation tasks. This system enables Sam to improve documentation based on actual user needs, identify areas where existing documentation is unclear or insufficient, and prioritize documentation efforts based on quantifiable user challenges.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Documentation structure analysis must be testable with sample content hierarchies
- Screenshot capture must be verifiable without actual UI interactions
- Style checking must be testable against predefined style rules
- Translation tracking must be verifiable with simulated language variants
- Feedback processing must be testable with sample user comments
- All components must be unit testable with appropriate mocking

### Performance Expectations
- Structure visualization must handle documentation sets with 10,000+ pages
- Screenshot management must efficiently handle 5,000+ images
- Style checking must validate documents at a rate of at least 100 pages per second
- Translation tracking must maintain performance with 20+ language variants
- Feedback processing must handle 1,000+ user comments per day
- The system must support at least 50 simultaneous documentation projects

### Integration Points
- Documentation management systems
- Image capture and processing tools
- Style checking libraries and custom rules
- Translation management platforms
- Feedback collection channels
- Content publishing systems

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work with multiple documentation formats (Markdown, AsciiDoc, etc.)
- All functionality must be accessible via programmatic API without UI components
- The system must maintain content relationships across documentation reorganizations
- Processing must be efficient enough for real-time style feedback
- Storage must be optimized for large numbers of visual assets

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Documentation Task Management**: A core module handling CRUD operations for documentation tasks with advanced metadata including component relationships, content type, audience, and platform.

2. **Content Structure Analysis**: Components for parsing, analyzing, and visualizing documentation hierarchies, relationships, and coverage metrics.

3. **Visual Asset Management**: A system for capturing, processing, storing, and embedding screenshots and other visual content with appropriate metadata.

4. **Style Compliance Engine**: Logic for checking content against configurable style rules, terminology standards, and formatting guidelines.

5. **Translation Coordination**: Functionality to track content variants across languages, synchronize updates, and manage translation workflows.

6. **Feedback Processing**: Mechanisms to collect, categorize, and convert user feedback into actionable documentation tasks with prioritization.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Documentation task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with component associations
- Content structure analysis with accurate gap identification
- Screenshot capture and management with proper metadata
- Style checking against configurable rule sets
- Translation tracking across multiple languages
- Feedback conversion to actionable tasks

### Critical User Scenarios
- Planning and tracking documentation for a new product release
- Identifying documentation gaps and prioritizing content creation
- Managing visual assets across multiple documentation sets
- Ensuring style consistency throughout large documentation projects
- Coordinating translation efforts for multilingual documentation
- Improving documentation based on user feedback patterns

### Performance Benchmarks
- Task operations must complete in <50ms for individual operations
- Structure analysis must process documentation sets with 10,000+ pages
- Screenshot management must handle libraries with 5,000+ images
- Style checking must validate at least 100 pages per second
- Translation tracking must efficiently handle 20+ language variants
- Feedback processing must convert 50+ comments per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling complex circular references in documentation structures
- Managing failed screenshot captures gracefully
- Appropriate behavior with conflicting or ambiguous style rules
- Maintaining translation relationships through major content restructuring
- Proper processing of unusual or malformed user feedback
- Graceful degradation with extremely large documentation projects

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Storage optimization must be explicitly verified

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system effectively visualizes documentation structure with accurate gap identification.
3. Screenshot capture and management is integrated with task workflows.
4. Style checking verifies content against configurable organizational guidelines.
5. Translation tracking manages content status across multiple language variants.
6. Reader feedback is successfully converted into actionable documentation tasks.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. The implementation supports the complete documentation management lifecycle.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
