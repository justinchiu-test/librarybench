# TermTask for Technical Writers

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for technical writers who create and maintain documentation for complex software systems. This variant focuses on documentation structure management, screenshot integration, style guide validation, translation tracking, and reader feedback incorporation to streamline the documentation workflow.

## Persona Description
Sam creates documentation for complex software systems and needs to track content creation tasks across multiple documents and platforms. His primary goal is to organize documentation tasks by product component and track dependencies between related content pieces.

## Key Requirements

1. **Documentation Structure Visualization**
   - Display content hierarchy showing documents and sections
   - Identify documentation gaps and outdated content
   - Visualize relationships between content pieces
   - Track documentation coverage across product components
   - This feature is critical because it gives Sam a comprehensive view of the documentation ecosystem, helping identify missing content, prioritize updates for outdated sections, and ensure consistent coverage across the entire product.

2. **Screenshot and Image Management**
   - Capture and organize screenshots directly within tasks
   - Tag images with metadata for easy searching
   - Track image updates when UI changes occur
   - Link screenshots to specific documentation sections
   - This capability is essential because technical documentation heavily relies on visual aids, and Sam needs to efficiently capture, organize, and maintain screenshots as products evolve, ensuring documentation remains visually accurate.

3. **Style Guide Compliance Checking**
   - Validate documentation against style guide rules
   - Highlight style inconsistencies and terminology issues
   - Track common style issues for writer education
   - Generate style compliance reports for documentation sets
   - This feature is vital because it ensures documentation consistency across large content sets, maintains brand voice and terminology standards, and helps Sam identify recurring style issues to improve his writing.

4. **Translation Management System**
   - Track content translations across multiple languages
   - Identify documentation requiring translation updates
   - Monitor translation progress and completeness
   - Generate reports on translation coverage and status
   - This functionality is critical because Sam works on multilingual documentation, and needs to efficiently track which content needs translation, coordinate with translation teams, and ensure all language versions remain synchronized.

5. **Reader Feedback Integration**
   - Create tasks from user questions and comments
   - Categorize feedback by documentation area and type
   - Track documentation improvements based on feedback
   - Measure documentation effectiveness through feedback metrics
   - This feature is essential because it transforms user input into actionable improvements, helps prioritize documentation work based on user needs, and provides metrics on documentation effectiveness.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock documentation structure for testing hierarchy visualization
- Virtual screenshot system for testing image management
- Sample style guide rules for testing compliance checking
- Simulated translation database for testing multilingual tracking
- Synthetic reader feedback for testing feedback processing

### Performance Expectations
- Support for documentation hierarchies with 10,000+ pages
- Handle 5,000+ screenshots with metadata and searching
- Style guide checking for 1,000+ page document sets in under 5 minutes
- Translation tracking across 20+ languages for all content
- Process and categorize 1,000+ reader feedback items per day

### Integration Points
- Documentation platforms (static site generators, CMSes)
- Image capture and manipulation tools
- Style checking and linting tools
- Translation management systems
- User feedback channels (forums, email, surveys)

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely in command-line environment
- Cannot modify documentation source without explicit approval
- Support for standard documentation formats (Markdown, AsciiDoc, etc.)
- Minimal external dependencies for portability
- Must handle large documentation sets efficiently

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the TermTask system for technical writers includes:

1. **Documentation Task Management Core**
   - Create, read, update, and delete documentation tasks
   - Organize tasks by product, component, and document type
   - Track task dependencies and blocking relationships
   - Support for documentation workflows and approval processes
   - Persistence with version history and change tracking

2. **Documentation Structure Engine**
   - Parse and analyze documentation file structures
   - Build hierarchical representation of content
   - Identify content gaps and outdated sections
   - Visualize content relationships and dependencies
   - Track documentation coverage metrics

3. **Image Management System**
   - Capture and store screenshots with metadata
   - Organize images by product area and purpose
   - Track image-to-documentation relationships
   - Support image comparison for detecting UI changes
   - Implement image search and retrieval

4. **Style Compliance Framework**
   - Define and store style guide rules
   - Implement rule checking against documentation
   - Generate style compliance reports
   - Track common style issues by writer and content area
   - Support for custom terminology dictionaries

5. **Translation Coordination System**
   - Track content translation status across languages
   - Identify content requiring translation updates
   - Monitor translation workflows and deadlines
   - Calculate translation completeness metrics
   - Generate translation status reports

6. **Feedback Processing Engine**
   - Collect and normalize reader feedback
   - Categorize feedback by type and content area
   - Create actionable tasks from feedback items
   - Track documentation improvements from feedback
   - Analyze feedback patterns and trends

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Documentation structure is correctly visualized and analyzed
- Screenshots are properly captured, stored, and linked to content
- Style guide compliance checking accurately identifies issues
- Translation status is correctly tracked across languages
- Reader feedback is properly processed into actionable tasks

### Critical User Scenarios
- Planning a new documentation section with proper structure
- Updating screenshots across multiple documents after a UI change
- Checking a large documentation set for style compliance
- Coordinating translation updates after content changes
- Processing reader feedback to improve documentation quality

### Performance Benchmarks
- Documentation structure analysis for 5,000+ files in under 30 seconds
- Screenshot management operations (capture, store, retrieve) in under 2 seconds
- Style checking 100-page document in under 10 seconds
- Translation status updates processed in real-time (< 1 second)
- Feedback categorization and task creation in under 3 seconds per item

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed documentation structures
- Managing broken image references or corrupted screenshots
- Processing documents with severe style issues
- Tracking partial or in-progress translations
