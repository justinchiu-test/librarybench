# DocuTrack - A Technical Writer's Task Management Library

## Overview
DocuTrack is a specialized task management library designed specifically for technical writers who create documentation for complex software systems. This library provides robust APIs for organizing documentation tasks by component, capturing screenshots and images, ensuring style guide compliance, managing translations, and integrating reader feedback to maintain comprehensive and high-quality technical documentation.

## Persona Description
Sam creates documentation for complex software systems and needs to track content creation tasks across multiple documents and platforms. His primary goal is to organize documentation tasks by product component and track dependencies between related content pieces.

## Key Requirements
1. **Documentation Structure Viewer**: The library must provide functionality to visualize content hierarchy and identify gaps in documentation coverage. This is critical for Sam to maintain a holistic view of the documentation landscape, ensuring complete coverage of all product components and identifying areas that need attention.

2. **Screenshot/Image Capture Integration**: The system should support capturing and associating screenshots and images with specific documentation tasks. This feature is essential for Sam to efficiently create visual aids that enhance written documentation, maintaining clear connections between images and the content they support.

3. **Style Guide Compliance Checking**: The library must offer tools to verify that completed documentation tasks adhere to established style guidelines. This functionality is crucial for Sam to maintain consistent tone, formatting, and terminology across all documentation, ensuring professional quality and unified user experience.

4. **Translation Tracking**: The system needs robust capabilities to manage multilingual documentation, tracking which content has been translated and to which languages. This feature is vital for Sam to coordinate translation efforts, monitor progress, and ensure that documentation is available in all required languages.

5. **Reader Feedback Integration**: The library must support creating tasks from user questions and feedback. This capability is important for Sam to leverage actual user experiences to identify areas where documentation needs improvement, ensuring that the content evolves to meet user needs.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be individually testable with mock documentation data
  - Documentation structure analysis must be verifiable with predefined content trees
  - Style checking functionality must be testable against configurable rule sets
  - Translation tracking must be testable with simulated multilingual content
  - Feedback integration must support synthetic user input for testing

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Documentation structure analysis < 100ms for projects with 1000+ pages
  - Screenshot management operations < 50ms
  - Style guide compliance checking < 200ms per document
  - Translation status retrieval < 50ms
  - Feedback processing and task creation < 100ms
  - The system must handle at least 5,000 documentation tasks with no performance degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - Document management systems and repositories
  - Screenshot capture tools and image processing libraries
  - Style checking and linting frameworks
  - Translation management systems
  - User feedback collection mechanisms
  - Export to various documentation formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF)

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must work with common documentation formats (Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText)
  - All image data must be stored efficiently or by reference
  - Style checking must be configurable for different style guides
  - Must support Unicode for multilingual content
  - External service dependencies must be abstracted for flexibility

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The library must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Management System**: 
   - Create, read, update, and delete documentation tasks with appropriate metadata
   - Support for task categorization by component, document type, and priority
   - Dependencies between related content pieces
   - Track task status, assignees, and deadlines

2. **Documentation Structure Analysis**: 
   - Model hierarchical documentation organization
   - Detect gaps and incomplete sections
   - Visualize relationships between content pieces
   - Track coverage of product components and features

3. **Visual Asset Management**: 
   - Associate screenshots and images with documentation tasks
   - Track image versions and updates
   - Manage metadata for images (captions, alt text)
   - Support various image capture mechanisms

4. **Style Guide Enforcement**: 
   - Check content against configurable style rules
   - Detect terminology inconsistencies
   - Verify formatting and structure compliance
   - Track style guide exceptions and approvals

5. **Translation Coordination**: 
   - Track which content has been translated to which languages
   - Manage translation status and progress
   - Identify content requiring translation updates
   - Support for translation memory concepts

6. **Feedback Processing**: 
   - Convert user questions to documentation tasks
   - Categorize feedback by topic and severity
   - Link feedback to specific documentation sections
   - Track resolution of feedback-generated tasks

## Testing Requirements
To validate a successful implementation, the following testing should be conducted:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
  - Documentation structure analysis and gap detection
  - Screenshot capture and association
  - Style guide compliance checking
  - Translation status tracking
  - Reader feedback processing

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Creating and organizing tasks for a complex product component
  - Identifying gaps in documentation coverage
  - Managing screenshots across documentation versions
  - Verifying style compliance for a set of documents
  - Tracking translation progress across multiple languages
  - Processing reader feedback into actionable tasks

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Documentation structure analysis < 100ms for 1000 pages
  - Image management operations < 50ms per operation
  - Style checking < 200ms per document
  - Translation status retrieval < 50ms for complex queries
  - Feedback processing < 100ms per item

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling deeply nested documentation structures
  - Managing broken image references
  - Processing documents with severe style violations
  - Dealing with untranslatable content
  - Handling ambiguous or irrelevant user feedback

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for documentation structure and style checking components
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive test cases
  - All error handling code paths must be tested

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
