# SecureTask CLI - Command-Line Task Management for Security Professionals

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system designed for security analysts conducting security audits and penetration testing. The system enables methodical tracking of security findings, documentation of vulnerabilities with proper evidence, and verification of remediation efforts with comprehensive compliance mapping.

## Persona Description
Trevor conducts security audits and penetration testing, needing to methodically track security findings and remediation tasks. His primary goal is to document security vulnerabilities with proper evidence and track verification of fixes.

## Key Requirements
1. **Secure Evidence Storage**: Implement a robust mechanism for storing vulnerability documentation, screenshots, and proof-of-concept code with appropriate encryption. This feature is critical for Trevor as it ensures sensitive security findings are protected from unauthorized access, provides a secure repository for potentially dangerous exploit code, and maintains client confidentiality while allowing authorized team members to access necessary evidence.

2. **CVSS Scoring Integration**: Create functionality to associate formal CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores with each security finding. This capability enables Trevor to apply industry-standard severity assessments to vulnerabilities, ensure consistent prioritization of security issues across different clients and systems, and communicate risk levels in standardized terminology that stakeholders understand.

3. **Remediation Workflow**: Develop a structured workflow system for vulnerability remediation with explicit verification requirements. This feature allows Trevor to track the complete lifecycle of security findings from discovery to verification, ensure proper validation of implemented fixes before closing issues, and maintain accountability throughout the remediation process with clear ownership and approval steps.

4. **Compliance Mapping**: Build a comprehensive system that links security findings to specific regulatory requirements and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO, PCI-DSS). This mapping helps Trevor demonstrate how identified vulnerabilities impact compliance status, generate tailored reports for specific compliance frameworks, and provide clear remediation guidance based on regulatory requirements.

5. **Security Report Generation**: Implement sophisticated reporting capabilities with appropriate redaction options for sensitive details. This functionality enables Trevor to produce professional security reports for different audience types, automatically handle sensitive information differently based on report type, and maintain consistency across all deliverables while saving significant report preparation time.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Evidence storage security must be verifiable through encryption testing
- CVSS scoring calculations must be testable against official CVSS examples
- Remediation workflow state transitions must be fully testable
- Compliance mapping must be verifiable with predefined regulatory frameworks
- Report generation must produce consistent outputs given identical inputs
- All components must be unit testable without security impacts

### Performance Expectations
- Evidence storage must efficiently handle artifacts up to 100MB
- CVSS calculations must complete in <50ms
- Remediation workflow must support tracking 1000+ active findings
- Compliance mapping must maintain performance with 50+ regulatory frameworks
- Report generation must process comprehensive reports with 500+ findings in <30 seconds

### Integration Points
- Secure storage system with encryption capabilities
- Official CVSS calculation algorithms
- Workflow state management engine
- Compliance framework database
- Template-based report generation system
- Redaction engine for sensitive information

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must never store sensitive data in plain text
- All functionality must be accessible via programmatic API without UI components
- The system must support air-gapped operation for high-security environments
- Evidence must be tamper-evident with verification capabilities
- Compliance frameworks must be updatable as regulations evolve

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Security Finding Management**: A core module handling CRUD operations for security findings with comprehensive metadata, including vulnerability details, affected systems, and timelines.

2. **Evidence Vault**: A secure storage system for vulnerability evidence with encryption, access control, and integrity verification capabilities.

3. **CVSS Calculator**: Components for performing official CVSS scoring calculations with all required metrics and producing standard severity ratings.

4. **Remediation Tracker**: A workflow engine for managing the complete vulnerability lifecycle from discovery through remediation to verification.

5. **Compliance Framework**: A flexible system for mapping findings to regulatory requirements across multiple frameworks with relationship tracking.

6. **Report Generator**: Tools for creating customized reports with appropriate content selection, formatting, and redaction based on audience and purpose.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Security finding creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with appropriate metadata
- Evidence storage with proper encryption and access controls
- CVSS scoring calculation accuracy and consistency
- Remediation workflow state transitions and validation
- Compliance mapping with accurate regulatory relationships
- Report generation with appropriate content selection and redaction

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete vulnerability lifecycle from discovery to verification
- Managing multiple concurrent security assessments
- Generating different report types for various stakeholders
- Tracking remediation progress across multiple client systems
- Demonstrating compliance status and gaps
- Securely sharing findings with appropriate team members

### Performance Benchmarks
- Finding operations must complete in <50ms for individual operations
- Evidence storage must efficiently handle artifacts up to 100MB
- CVSS calculations must process at least 1000 scores per second
- Remediation workflow must support transitioning 100+ findings per second
- Compliance mapping must handle frameworks with 1000+ controls
- Report generation must process at least 10 pages of content per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling attempts to store extremely large evidence files
- Proper behavior with invalid CVSS metric combinations
- Ensuring workflow state consistency with concurrent operations
- Maintaining accurate compliance mapping when frameworks change
- Appropriate content redaction for different audience levels
- Recovery from interrupted operations involving sensitive data

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% line coverage for all security-critical components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Security controls must be explicitly verified
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
