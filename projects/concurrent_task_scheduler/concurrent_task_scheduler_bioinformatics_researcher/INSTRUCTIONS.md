# Genomic Data Processing Pipeline Scheduler

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed for processing genomic sequencing data through complex analytical pipelines with strict data integrity requirements. This system ensures reliable, traceable genomic data processing while maximizing throughput on specialized sequencing equipment.

## Persona Description
Dr. Zhang processes genomic sequencing data through complex analytical pipelines with strict accuracy requirements. His primary goal is to ensure data integrity throughout processing while maximizing throughput on expensive sequencing equipment.

## Key Requirements
1. **Data Provenance Tracking System**
   - Implement comprehensive provenance tracking that records all data transformations, processing parameters, and computational environments throughout the analysis pipeline
   - Critical for Dr. Zhang as it ensures reproducibility of results, enables regulatory compliance for clinical applications, and provides an auditable record of all processing steps applied to sensitive genomic data

2. **Pipeline Validation with Integrity Checks**
   - Create a validation framework that performs pre-execution verification of pipeline configurations, input data quality, and expected outputs
   - Essential for Dr. Zhang to prevent costly processing errors on large genomic datasets, where errors might only be detected after days of computation, wasting both time and expensive sequencing resources

3. **Stage-Specific Error Handling Strategies**
   - Develop customizable error handling that can be tailored to different pipeline stages (e.g., alignment, variant calling, annotation) with appropriate recovery mechanisms
   - Vital for genomic pipelines where different stages have distinct error profiles and recovery requirements, allowing graceful handling of common issues without pipeline failure

4. **Sample Degradation-Based Prioritization**
   - Implement a priority system that automatically adjusts task scheduling based on biological sample stability timelines
   - Crucial for Dr. Zhang who works with time-sensitive biological samples that can degrade, ensuring that samples with limited stability are processed first to preserve data quality

5. **Equipment Utilization Optimization**
   - Build a scheduler that maximizes utilization of sequencing and analysis equipment while integrating with predictive maintenance systems
   - Important for Dr. Zhang to minimize expensive equipment downtime, schedule maintenance during natural processing gaps, and ensure continuous operation of critical genomic analysis infrastructure

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All pipeline components must be independently testable with synthetic genomic data
  - Provenance tracking must be verifiable with known input-output transformations
  - Error handling strategies must be testable through fault injection
  - Scheduling algorithms must be testable with simulated sample degradation timelines
  - System must achieve >95% test coverage with deterministic outcomes

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Pipeline validation must complete in under 60 seconds for complex workflows
  - Provenance tracking overhead must not exceed 3% of total processing time
  - Scheduler must maintain >90% equipment utilization during normal operation
  - System must handle at least 50 concurrent genomic analysis pipelines
  - Priority recalculations must complete in under 5 seconds when new samples arrive

- **Integration Points**
  - Bioinformatics tools and frameworks (Biopython, samtools, BWA, GATK)
  - Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) for sample tracking
  - Equipment control and monitoring systems for sequencers and compute clusters
  - Data storage systems for raw and processed genomic data
  - Scientific workflow management systems for pipeline definition

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must maintain perfect data integrity throughout all processing stages
  - Must comply with relevant regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR for clinical applications)
  - Must operate within existing bioinformatics infrastructure
  - All operations must be fully auditable and reproducible
  - Implementation must accommodate both research and clinical genomics workflows

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a comprehensive framework for defining, validating, and executing genomic analysis pipelines as directed acyclic graphs with complex interdependencies. It should implement intelligent scheduling algorithms that prioritize time-sensitive samples while maximizing equipment utilization, with special attention to data integrity and provenance tracking.

Key components include:
1. A pipeline definition system using Python decorators/functions that captures all processing parameters
2. A validation engine that performs pre-execution checks on pipeline configurations and input data
3. A provenance tracking system that records all data transformations with complete parameter sets
4. A priority-based scheduler that factors in sample stability, equipment availability, and computational requirements
5. Stage-specific error handling strategies with appropriate recovery mechanisms
6. An equipment utilization optimizer that coordinates with maintenance schedules

## Testing Requirements

  - Provenance tracking correctly captures all data transformations and parameters
  - Pipeline validation detects configuration errors before execution begins
  - Error handling correctly applies stage-appropriate recovery strategies
  - Sample prioritization correctly schedules based on degradation timelines
  - Equipment utilization optimizer maintains high throughput while accommodating maintenance

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Processing a time-sensitive clinical sample that requires expedited handling
  - Recovery from a failed sequencing run with partial data salvage
  - Coordinating multiple concurrent research projects with shared equipment
  - Validating a complex multi-stage pipeline before production deployment
  - Tracking provenance for a sample from raw sequencing through variant calling and annotation

  - Equipment utilization increases by at least 25% compared to current scheduling
  - Pipeline failures due to preventable errors reduced by 90%
  - Provenance tracking overhead less than 3% of total processing time
  - Validation of complex pipelines completes in under 60 seconds
  - Sample prioritization accuracy exceeds 95% for degradation-sensitive scheduling

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Recovery from partial equipment failure during processing
  - Handling of data corruption with appropriate isolation and reporting
  - Management of resource contention during peak demand periods
  - Recovery from pipeline definition errors discovered mid-execution
  - Handling of invalid or unexpected data formats in the processing stream

  - >95% line coverage for all pipeline components
  - 100% coverage of provenance tracking logic
  - 100% coverage of error handling and recovery strategies
  - >95% branch coverage for scheduling and prioritization logic
  - Integration tests must verify end-to-end data integrity

- Pipeline failures due to preventable errors reduced by 90%
- Sample processing throughput increases by at least 30%
- Time from sample arrival to results delivery decreases by 40%
- Data provenance is 100% traceable and reproducible
