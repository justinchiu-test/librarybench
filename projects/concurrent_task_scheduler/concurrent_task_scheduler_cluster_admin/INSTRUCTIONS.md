# Academic Computing Resource Allocation System

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed to fairly distribute shared computing resources across multiple academic departments with diverse computational needs. This system balances research priorities, teaching requirements, and specialized hardware access while enforcing departmental quotas and maximizing overall cluster utilization.

## Persona Description
Marcus manages a shared computing cluster used by multiple academic departments with diverse computational needs. His primary goal is to fairly allocate computing resources while allowing priority overrides for urgent research and teaching needs.

## Key Requirements
1. **Department Quota Management with Resource Reallocation**
   - Implement a quota system that allocates guaranteed computing resources to departments based on funding contributions, with automatic reallocation of unused resources to departments with active demand
   - Critical for Marcus to ensure fair resource distribution across departments while maximizing overall cluster utilization, preventing resources from sitting idle when some departments have low usage while others have excess demand

2. **Course Schedule Integration for Teaching Resources**
   - Create a scheduling system that automatically reserves computing capacity based on academic course schedules, ensuring resources are available for labs and classroom activities
   - Essential for Marcus to guarantee that teaching activities receive priority during scheduled class times, preventing research jobs from consuming resources needed for time-sensitive educational activities

3. **Research Deadline Awareness with Capacity Allocation**
   - Develop deadline-based priority adjustments that allocate additional resources to research projects approaching important deadlines (grant submissions, conference papers, etc.)
   - Vital for supporting researchers facing critical deadlines, allowing Marcus to temporarily boost resources for time-sensitive research without permanently reallocating departmental quotas

4. **Fairness Monitoring with Resource Hogging Intervention**
   - Build automated detection of resource monopolization with intervention policies that prevent individual users or projects from dominating shared resources
   - Crucial for Marcus to maintain equitable access across the diverse user base, identifying and addressing situations where a single user or group is consuming excessive resources to the detriment of others

5. **Specialized Hardware Time-Sharing Optimization**
   - Implement intelligent scheduling for limited specialized resources (GPUs, high-memory nodes, etc.) with optimized time-sharing and job batching
   - Important for maximizing the utility of expensive specialized hardware that is in high demand across multiple departments, ensuring that these limited resources provide maximum benefit to the academic community

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All quota management components must be testable with simulated department usage patterns
  - Scheduling algorithms must be verifiable against sample course timetables
  - Deadline prioritization must be testable with various deadline scenarios
  - Fairness monitoring must be validatable with simulated usage patterns
  - Hardware allocation must be verifiable with different hardware configurations

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Quota calculations and adjustments must complete within 10 seconds
  - Course schedule reservations must be processed at least 24 hours in advance
  - Deadline-based priority adjustments must be calculated within 1 minute of job submission
  - Fairness monitoring must detect resource hogging within 5 minutes of occurrence
  - Specialized hardware allocation must achieve at least 90% utilization

- **Integration Points**
  - Job scheduling systems (SLURM, PBS, etc.) for task execution
  - University course registration systems for schedule data
  - Research project management systems for deadline information
  - User authentication and authorization systems
  - Hardware monitoring and management systems

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must operate within existing HPC infrastructure
  - Must maintain backward compatibility with current job submission workflows
  - Must support diverse computational workloads (HPC, ML, data analysis, simulations)
  - Must accommodate both interactive and batch processing modes
  - Implementation must be vendor-neutral across different cluster configurations

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a framework for defining, submitting, and managing computational jobs across a shared academic computing cluster. It should implement intelligent scheduling algorithms that optimize for both fairness and resource utilization, with special attention to departmental quotas, teaching requirements, and research deadlines.

Key components include:
1. A job definition system using Python decorators/functions for declaring computational tasks and resource requirements
2. A quota management system that tracks and enforces departmental resource allocations
3. A schedule-aware reservation system for academic teaching activities
4. A deadline-based priority system for research projects
5. A fairness monitoring system that detects and addresses resource monopolization
6. A specialized hardware allocation optimizer for limited resources

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Quota management correctly allocates and reallocates resources based on departmental entitlements
  - Course schedule integration properly reserves resources for teaching activities
  - Research deadline awareness appropriately prioritizes time-sensitive projects
  - Fairness monitoring accurately detects and mitigates resource hogging
  - Specialized hardware allocation optimally assigns limited resources to jobs

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Balancing competing demands during peak usage periods (end of semester, conference deadlines)
  - Handling emergency resource requests for critical research
  - Managing resource contention between teaching and research activities
  - Addressing a situation where a single user is consuming excessive resources
  - Optimizing GPU allocation across machine learning research and computational science

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Overall cluster utilization increases to at least 85% (from typical 60%)
  - Teaching resource availability achieves 100% compliance with course schedules
  - Research deadline prioritization improves on-time completion by at least 25%
  - Resource hogging incidents reduced by 90% through automated intervention
  - Specialized hardware utilization increases by at least 40%

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Recovery from partial cluster node failures
  - Handling of conflicting priority claims between departments
  - Management of unexpected system maintenance requirements
  - Resolution of deadline conflicts between multiple high-priority projects
  - Graceful degradation when demand exceeds total available resources

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - >90% line coverage for all scheduler components
  - 100% coverage of quota calculation and enforcement logic
  - 100% coverage of priority determination algorithms
  - >95% branch coverage for fairness monitoring logic
  - Integration tests must verify end-to-end job scheduling across departments

## Success Criteria
- Overall cluster utilization increases from 60% to at least 85%
- Departmental resource allocation complaints reduced by 80%
- Course-related computing activities achieve 100% resource availability
- Research deadline compliance improves by at least 30%
- User satisfaction with specialized hardware access increases significantly
- Marcus can manage a 50% larger cluster without additional administrative overhead
