# Research-Focused ML Pipeline Scheduler

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed specifically for optimizing machine learning workflows in research environments. This system intelligently allocates computational resources across multiple data science projects while enforcing resource constraints and ensuring critical research deadlines are met.

## Persona Description
Dr. Elisa manages a team of data scientists who run complex machine learning pipelines that combine data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. Her primary goal is to optimize computational resource usage across multiple team projects while ensuring critical research deadlines are met.

## Key Requirements
1. **Research Project Prioritization System**
   - Implement dynamic project priority management that automatically adjusts resource allocation based on research deadlines, project importance, and resource requirements
   - Critical for Dr. Elisa as it allows her team to adapt to changing research priorities without manual intervention in resource allocation, ensuring highest-value projects get resources when needed

2. **Computational Budget Enforcement**
   - Create a resource allocation mechanism that enforces project-specific and user-specific resource caps on CPU, memory, and specialized hardware
   - Essential for Dr. Elisa's team to prevent resource hogging by individual projects/researchers and ensure fair allocation across multiple concurrent research initiatives

3. **Experiment Checkpointing with Automatic Resumption**
   - Build a robust checkpointing system that periodically saves experiment state and automatically resumes processing after system failures
   - Vital for Dr. Elisa's team working on long-running ML training jobs where hardware failures or preemptions would otherwise require complete restarts, wasting valuable research time

4. **GPU/Specialized Hardware Allocation**
   - Develop intelligent allocation of specialized computing resources (GPUs, TPUs) with automatic optimization of training job batching and device assignment
   - Critical for maximizing the utilization of expensive specialized hardware and ensuring ML model training completes efficiently across multiple concurrent research projects

5. **Pipeline Visualization with Timing Insights**
   - Implement a monitoring system showing actual vs. expected completion times for all pipeline stages across projects
   - Essential for Dr. Elisa to track research progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions about resource allocation adjustments

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Each scheduling component must be independently testable with mocked resources
  - Pipeline execution must be replayable from checkpoints for testing resumption
  - Resource allocation decisions must be explainable and verifiable
  - Timing predictions must be testable against historical execution data
  - All components must achieve >90% test coverage

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Scheduling decisions must be made within 500ms even with 100+ concurrent tasks
  - Resource monitoring overhead must not exceed 1% of total system resources
  - Checkpoint operations must not add more than 5% overhead to task execution
  - System must scale to handle at least 50 concurrent research projects
  - Pipeline visualization must update in near real-time (< 2 second lag)

- **Integration Points**
  - Python ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) compatibility
  - Resource monitoring integration with system metrics (CPU, memory, GPU)
  - Experiment tracking systems (MLflow, Weights & Biases) for result logging
  - Notification services for experiment completion and failures
  - Version control integration for experiment reproducibility

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must operate without requiring admin/root access on computing resources
  - Must support heterogeneous computing environments (different GPU types/generations)
  - Must handle preemptible/spot computing resources gracefully
  - All persistence must be thread-safe and corruption-resistant
  - Implementation must be framework-agnostic while supporting ML-specific optimizations

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a comprehensive framework for defining complex ML pipelines as directed acyclic graphs of tasks with dependencies. It must implement intelligent scheduling algorithms that optimize for both resource efficiency and research deadlines. The scheduler should understand ML-specific resource requirements (like GPU memory) and optimize hardware allocation accordingly.

Key components include:
1. A pipeline definition system using Python decorators/functions for declaring tasks and dependencies
2. A priority-based scheduler that factors in project importance, deadlines, and resource needs
3. Resource monitoring and constraint enforcement to ensure budget compliance
4. Checkpointing middleware that transparently adds persistence to pipeline stages
5. Dynamic resource allocation that optimally assigns specialized hardware to tasks
6. A monitoring and statistics system that provides insights into pipeline execution and resource usage

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Project prioritization correctly balances resources according to deadlines and importance
  - Resource limits are properly enforced without deadlocks or starvation
  - Checkpointing successfully captures state and allows resumption from failures
  - Specialized hardware allocation optimally distributes GPU/TPU resources to tasks
  - Pipeline execution times are accurately predicted based on historical data

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Multiple concurrent research pipelines with conflicting resource requirements
  - Handling of sudden priority changes when new critical research emerges
  - Recovery from simulated hardware failures mid-experiment
  - Optimal scheduling when specialized hardware is oversubscribed
  - Long-running experiments that span multiple days of continuous computation

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Scheduler overhead < 1% of total computation time
  - Resource utilization increase of at least 20% compared to naive scheduling
  - Checkpoint/resume overhead < 5% of total computation time
  - 95th percentile pipeline execution time within 10% of predicted duration
  - System must remain responsive with 50+ concurrent project pipelines

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Resource exhaustion handling with graceful pipeline hibernation
  - Corrupt checkpoint recovery and partial state resumption
  - Handling of misbehaving tasks that exceed resource declarations
  - Pipeline deadlock detection and automatic resolution
  - Abrupt system shutdown with recovery from inconsistent state

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - > 90% line coverage for all scheduler components
  - 100% coverage of resource allocation logic
  - 100% coverage of checkpoint/resume functionality
  - > 95% branch coverage for priority calculation logic
  - Integration tests must cover all supported ML framework integrations

## Success Criteria
- Research teams can run 30% more experiments with the same computing resources
- Project deadline compliance improves from 70% to 95%
- Resource utilization increases by at least 25% for specialized hardware
- Experiment failures due to system issues reduced by 80%
- Research velocity (time from experiment conception to results) improves by 40%
- Dr. Elisa's team can manage 2x more concurrent projects with the same administrative overhead
