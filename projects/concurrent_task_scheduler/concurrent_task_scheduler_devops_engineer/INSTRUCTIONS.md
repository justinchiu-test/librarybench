# CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator

A specialized concurrent task scheduler optimized for continuous integration and delivery pipelines in microservice architectures.

## Overview

The CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator is a task scheduling framework designed specifically for orchestrating build, test, and deployment processes across microservice architectures. It intelligently matches tasks to execution environments, implements build artifact caching, dynamically adjusts parallelism, resolves cross-service dependencies, and provides accurate execution time forecasting.

## Persona Description

Raj designs CI/CD pipelines for a large software organization with hundreds of microservices. His primary goal is to coordinate build, test, and deployment tasks across services while efficiently utilizing the company's build farm infrastructure.

## Key Requirements

1. **Infrastructure-Aware Task Scheduling**
   - Scheduling system that intelligently matches different types of tasks (build, test, deploy) to optimal execution environments based on task requirements and environment capabilities
   - Critical for Raj because it ensures efficient usage of specialized build infrastructure and reduces bottlenecks by directing tasks to the most appropriate execution environment

2. **Build Artifact Caching System**
   - Intelligent caching mechanism for build artifacts with dependency-based invalidation that automatically detects when caches should be refreshed
   - Essential because it dramatically speeds up builds by avoiding unnecessary recompilation of unchanged components, crucial when managing hundreds of microservices with shared dependencies

3. **Dynamic Parallelism Control**
   - Runtime adjustment of concurrent task execution based on system load and task priority
   - Vital for adapting to changing infrastructure conditions, balancing maximum throughput during normal operations with focused resource allocation during high-priority or time-sensitive builds

4. **Cross-Service Dependency Resolution**
   - Automatic detection and scheduling of builds across service boundaries with minimal blocking
   - Critical because microservice architectures have complex interdependencies, and efficient scheduling across these boundaries ensures that dependent services are built in the correct order with minimal idle waiting time

5. **Pipeline Execution Forecasting**
   - Predictive modeling that estimates pipeline completion times based on historical performance data and current system conditions
   - Important for providing accurate delivery estimates to stakeholders and identifying potential bottlenecks or delays before they impact delivery timelines

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable in isolation with appropriate mocks
- Build environment characteristics must be simulatable in test scenarios
- Task execution patterns must be replayable for performance analysis
- Dependency graph resolution must be testable with synthetic service graphs

### Performance Expectations
- Scheduling decisions must be made in under 50ms for any pipeline configuration
- Support for at least 1,000 concurrent build tasks across different services
- Caching mechanisms should provide at least 80% time reduction for unchanged components
- Pipeline forecast accuracy should be within 10% of actual completion time for 90% of builds

### Integration Points
- Task definition API for pipeline configuration
- Build environment abstraction for worker configuration
- Artifact storage interface for caching implementation
- Monitoring hooks for build metrics collection

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without central database dependencies
- File system access limited to designated artifact directories
- Must support heterogeneous build environments (different OS, architecture)
- No persistent network connections to external services

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task and Pipeline Definition**
   - Python API for defining build, test, and deployment tasks
   - Service dependency specification mechanisms
   - Resource requirement declarations for tasks

2. **Intelligent Scheduling**
   - Environment-aware task allocation
   - Dependency-based execution ordering
   - Priority-based resource allocation
   - Load-balanced task distribution

3. **Caching and Optimization**
   - Artifact caching with content-based invalidation
   - Incremental build optimization
   - Resource usage profiling for future optimization

4. **Execution and Control**
   - Parallel task execution within and across services
   - Dynamic concurrency adjustment
   - Progress monitoring and reporting
   - Timeout and cancellation handling

5. **Analysis and Forecasting**
   - Historical performance data collection
   - Build time prediction and bottleneck identification
   - Resource utilization analytics
   - Dependency impact analysis

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Tasks are correctly matched to appropriate execution environments
- Build caching correctly identifies and reuses valid artifacts
- Parallelism adjusts appropriately under varying system loads
- Cross-service dependencies are correctly resolved and scheduled
- Execution time forecasts accurately predict actual completion times

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete build pipeline for a microservice with multiple dependencies
- High-priority hotfix build that requires resource prioritization
- Simultaneous builds across multiple interconnected services
- Cache invalidation after dependency changes
- Recovery from failed or interrupted builds

### Performance Benchmarks
- Scheduling overhead less than 5% of total build time
- Cache hit rate exceeding 90% for unchanged components
- Resource utilization maintains above 80% during peak periods
- Cross-service dependency resolution completes in under 500ms for 100 services
- Forecast accuracy within 10% of actual completion time for 90% of builds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Circular dependencies between services
- Environment failure during build execution
- Cache corruption or invalidation
- Resource exhaustion under heavy load
- Priority inversion scenarios

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core scheduling logic
- All caching paths fully covered by tests
- Complete coverage of dependency resolution algorithms
- All error handling and recovery paths verified
- Performance tests for all critical execution paths

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Build tasks are consistently executed in the most appropriate environment
2. Build times for unchanged components are reduced by at least 80% through caching
3. System resources maintain at least 80% utilization during peak periods
4. Cross-service builds complete with minimal blocking and wait time
5. Build time forecasts are accurate within 10% for 90% of pipeline executions
6. The system scales effectively to handle 1,000+ concurrent tasks
7. All tests pass, including edge cases and error conditions
8. Task scheduling overhead remains below 5% of total execution time
