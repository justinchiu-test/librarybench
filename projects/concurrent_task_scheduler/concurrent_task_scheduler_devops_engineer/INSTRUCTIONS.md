# CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator for Microservices

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed for modern DevOps environments, focused on efficiently coordinating build, test, and deployment tasks across hundreds of microservices. This system optimizes build farm infrastructure utilization while intelligently handling cross-service dependencies and dynamically adapting to changing system loads.

## Persona Description
Raj designs CI/CD pipelines for a large software organization with hundreds of microservices. His primary goal is to coordinate build, test, and deployment tasks across services while efficiently utilizing the company's build farm infrastructure.

## Key Requirements

1. **Infrastructure-Aware Task Scheduling**
   - Implement intelligent scheduling that matches tasks to optimal execution environments based on task requirements and environment capabilities
   - This feature is critical for Raj as it ensures that specialized tasks (like UI tests, security scans, or builds requiring specific platforms) are routed to the most appropriate build agents
   - The system must collect and utilize infrastructure metadata to make optimal placement decisions

2. **Build Artifact Caching System**
   - Create a sophisticated caching mechanism for build artifacts with dependency-based invalidation to prevent redundant work
   - This feature is essential for Raj as it dramatically reduces build times and infrastructure load by avoiding repeated compilation of unchanged components
   - Must accurately track dependencies to ensure cache invalidation when dependent components change

3. **Dynamic Parallelism Control**
   - Implement adaptive parallelism that adjusts task concurrency based on system load, task priority, and resource availability
   - This feature is crucial for Raj to maximize build farm throughput while preventing system overload during peak usage periods
   - Must include throttling mechanisms for resource-intensive operations to maintain overall system responsiveness

4. **Cross-Service Dependency Resolution**
   - Develop a dependency management system that minimizes blocking between services during build and deployment processes
   - This feature is vital for Raj as it reduces overall pipeline latency in a microservices environment where services have complex interdependencies
   - Must support both explicit dependencies and automatically detected dependencies

5. **Pipeline Time Forecasting**
   - Create a prediction system that models pipeline execution time based on historical data, current system load, and pipeline composition
   - This feature is important for Raj to provide reliable estimates for deployment timelines and to identify optimization opportunities
   - Must adapt to changing patterns and detect anomalies in execution times

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be independently testable with well-defined interfaces
- System must support mocking of external services and infrastructure components
- Tests must validate correct behavior under various load conditions and failure scenarios
- Test coverage should exceed 90% for core scheduling and dependency resolution components

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 500 concurrent tasks across multiple pipelines
- Scheduling decisions must complete in under 50ms for complex dependency graphs
- System should achieve at least 95% resource utilization under normal conditions
- Cache hit rate should exceed 85% for typical incremental builds

### Integration Points
- Integration with common CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Support for container orchestration systems (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Interfaces for artifact storage systems (Artifactory, Nexus)
- Compatibility with infrastructure provisioning tools (Terraform, Pulumi)

### Key Constraints
- IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.
- The system must maintain deterministic builds for reproducibility
- All operations should be captured in detailed audit logs
- Must operate efficiently in heterogeneous infrastructure environments
- System must be resilient to infrastructure failures

## Core Functionality

The CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator must provide:

1. **Task Definition and Pipeline Construction**
   - A declarative API for defining build, test, and deployment tasks with their dependencies
   - Support for complex pipeline topologies with conditional execution paths
   - Version-aware task definitions to support evolving pipeline requirements

2. **Intelligent Resource Allocation**
   - Matching of tasks to appropriate infrastructure based on requirements
   - Dynamic adjustment of parallelism based on system conditions
   - Fair sharing of resources across teams and projects with priority support

3. **Caching and Artifacts Management**
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of build artifacts with content-based addressing
   - Dependency-aware cache invalidation to ensure correctness
   - Garbage collection of outdated artifacts to manage storage constraints

4. **Dependency Resolution and Coordination**
   - Analysis of inter-service dependencies to optimize execution order
   - Minimization of blocking relationships between pipeline stages
   - Support for complex dependency types (build-time, test-time, runtime)

5. **Monitoring and Prediction**
   - Collection of detailed execution metrics for all pipeline components
   - Predictive models for pipeline execution time and resource utilization
   - Anomaly detection to identify performance regressions

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Task scheduling correctly maps tasks to appropriate infrastructure
- Caching system correctly invalidates and reuses artifacts
- Parallelism control adapts appropriately to system load
- Dependency resolution correctly orders task execution
- Execution time predictions fall within acceptable error margins

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Handling of complex microservice dependency graphs
- Response to infrastructure failure during pipeline execution
- Performance under high concurrency with heterogeneous task types
- Correct behavior with incremental builds and partial changes
- Adaptation to varying system load conditions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Scheduling overhead should not exceed 2% of total pipeline execution time
- Cache lookup operations should complete in under 10ms
- System should handle at least 100 pipeline initiations per minute
- End-to-end latency should be at least 30% better than naive sequential execution

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of circular dependencies between services
- Recovery from infrastructure failures during critical operations
- Correct behavior when cache storage becomes corrupted or unavailable
- Proper handling of tasks that exceed their resource allocation
- Graceful degradation under extreme load conditions

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core scheduling and caching components
- Comprehensive integration tests for dependency resolution
- Performance tests simulating production-scale pipeline executions
- Chaos testing for infrastructure failure scenarios

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Infrastructure-aware scheduling correctly matches tasks to optimal execution environments
2. Build artifact caching achieves at least 85% hit rate for incremental builds
3. Dynamic parallelism control maintains high resource utilization without overloading the system
4. Cross-service dependency resolution minimizes blocking between services
5. Execution time predictions are within 15% of actual completion times for 90% of pipelines

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions

1. Setup a virtual environment using UV:
   ```
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. CRITICAL: Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate pytest_results.json:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a critical requirement for project completion.
