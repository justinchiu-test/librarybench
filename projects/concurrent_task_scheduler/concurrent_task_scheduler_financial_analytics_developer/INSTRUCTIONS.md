# Low-Latency Trading Task Scheduler

A concurrent task scheduler optimized for high-frequency trading systems with strict timing guarantees and performance optimization.

## Overview

The Low-Latency Trading Task Scheduler is a specialized task execution framework designed for financial trading systems that require deterministic, nanosecond-precision timing. It provides latency-focused scheduling, automatic critical path optimization, hardware affinity controls, real-time performance monitoring, and minimal-impact logging to ensure that time-sensitive trading tasks meet strict execution guarantees.

## Persona Description

Sophia builds high-frequency trading systems that must process market data and execute trading algorithms with minimal latency. Her primary goal is to ensure critical tasks meet strict timing guarantees while maximizing overall system throughput.

## Key Requirements

1. **Nanosecond-Precision Timing Control**
   - Latency-focused scheduling system that provides nanosecond-level precision for timing-critical operations
   - Essential for Sophia because high-frequency trading algorithms require deterministic execution with minimal jitter to maintain their competitive edge and ensure accurate market timing

2. **Critical Path Optimization**
   - Automatic identification and prioritization of the critical execution path with dynamic task reordering capabilities
   - Critical because trading strategies have multiple components (market data processing, strategy calculation, order management), and automatically prioritizing the tasks on the critical latency path ensures minimum execution time for complete trading cycles

3. **Hardware Affinity Management**
   - Fine-grained control over processor and memory resource assignment to optimize task execution
   - Vital for minimizing latency by ensuring tasks run on optimal CPU cores, with proper cache locality, memory placement, and NUMA considerations that significantly impact performance in latency-sensitive systems

4. **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
   - Continuous monitoring system that detects anomalies in execution timing and automatically initiates mitigation strategies
   - Crucial for identifying and responding to performance issues in real-time, as even microsecond-level delays can represent significant financial impact in high-frequency trading

5. **Low-Impact Execution Logging**
   - Minimal-overhead logging system that records task execution details with negligible impact on performance
   - Necessary for regulatory compliance, performance analysis, and debugging while ensuring that the logging itself doesn't compromise the latency requirements of the trading system

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Deterministic execution mode for reproducible testing
- Synthetic market data generation for strategy testing
- Timing verification with nanosecond precision
- Performance regression testing framework

### Performance Expectations
- Core scheduling decisions in under 1 microsecond
- Support for at least 100,000 tasks per second
- End-to-end critical path latency under 10 microseconds
- Monitoring overhead less than 0.1% of execution time

### Integration Points
- Market data feed interface
- Trading algorithm API
- Order execution gateway
- Performance telemetry export

### Key Constraints
- Zero garbage collection during critical path execution
- No system calls on hot paths
- Bounded memory usage regardless of throughput
- No external network operations during critical task execution

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Low-Latency Trading Task Scheduler should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Definition and Classification**
   - Python API for defining tasks with timing requirements
   - Critical path specification and automatic detection
   - Latency sensitivity classification

2. **Precision Scheduling and Execution**
   - Nanosecond-precision task scheduling
   - Deterministic execution guarantees
   - Priority-based preemption
   - Deadline monitoring and enforcement

3. **Resource Management**
   - CPU core and cache affinity control
   - Memory allocation and placement optimization
   - Resource reservation for critical tasks
   - Contention avoidance strategies

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Real-time latency measurement
   - Statistical anomaly detection
   - Performance degradation alerts
   - Timing jitter analysis

5. **Execution Logging and Analysis**
   - Low-overhead execution recording
   - Timing correlation and verification
   - Post-execution performance analysis
   - Compliance audit trail generation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Tasks execute with nanosecond timing precision
- Critical path optimization correctly prioritizes tasks
- Hardware affinity controls improve execution performance
- Performance anomalies are detected and mitigated
- Logging has minimal impact on execution time

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete trading cycle from market data to order execution
- Multiple competing strategies with different priorities
- Recovery from performance anomalies
- Operation under peak market volatility conditions
- Execution with varying hardware resource availability

### Performance Benchmarks
- Task scheduling overhead under 500 nanoseconds
- Critical path latency within 99% of theoretical minimum
- Hardware affinity improving performance by at least 20%
- Anomaly detection within 100 microseconds of occurrence
- Logging overhead less than 50 nanoseconds per event

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- CPU cache thrashing detection and prevention
- Network feed jitter compensation
- Priority inversion avoidance
- Deadline violation handling
- Resource exhaustion management

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of critical path scheduling logic
- Complete verification of timing precision guarantees
- Full testing of hardware affinity optimization
- All anomaly detection algorithms verified
- Logging performance impact measured under all scenarios

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Tasks consistently execute with timing precision within 100 nanoseconds
2. Critical path optimization reduces end-to-end latency by at least 30%
3. Hardware affinity controls improve performance by at least 20%
4. Performance anomalies are detected and mitigated within 100 microseconds
5. Logging overhead remains below 0.1% of total execution time
6. The system maintains performance under peak load conditions
7. All tests pass, including timing precision verification
8. The system processes at least 100,000 tasks per second with deterministic latency
