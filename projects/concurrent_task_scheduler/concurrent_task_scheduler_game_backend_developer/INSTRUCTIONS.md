# Game Server Task Scheduler

A concurrent task scheduler optimized for multiplayer game servers that prioritizes player experience while efficiently managing background tasks.

## Overview

The Game Server Task Scheduler is a specialized task execution framework designed for multiplayer game environments. It implements player experience prioritization, physics calculation optimization, dynamic AI processing, server load balancing, and transaction processing guarantees to ensure smooth gameplay while efficiently handling background tasks.

## Persona Description

Leila develops multiplayer game server infrastructure that must handle thousands of concurrent player sessions with real-time interaction. Her primary goal is to ensure smooth player experience by prioritizing game state updates while handling background tasks efficiently.

## Key Requirements

1. **Player Experience Prioritization**
   - Task scheduling system that adjusts priorities based on player session factors (player count, session type, activity level)
   - Critical for Leila because maintaining responsive gameplay for active players is essential for game quality, requiring dynamic reprioritization to ensure that player-facing tasks always receive processing preference

2. **Physics Calculation Optimization**
   - Task partitioning system that divides physics workloads based on spatial proximity in the game world
   - Essential for efficiently processing complex physics interactions in large game worlds by focusing computational resources on regions with high player activity and reducing calculations for inactive areas

3. **AI Processing Throttling**
   - Dynamic adjustment of AI task allocation that throttles non-essential AI processing during peak player activity
   - Important for balancing realistic NPC behavior with server performance by intelligently reducing AI complexity during high-load periods while maintaining minimum acceptable behavior

4. **Server Load Balancing**
   - Task distribution system that manages workloads across server instances while maintaining session affinity
   - Vital for evenly distributing player connections and computational tasks across the server infrastructure while ensuring that related game operations remain on the same server to minimize latency and state synchronization issues

5. **Transaction Processing Guarantees**
   - Scheduling system that ensures in-game purchases and rewards are processed with guaranteed execution
   - Critical for providing reliable microtransaction services and preventing revenue loss or player frustration from failed purchases, requiring special handling to ensure these operations complete successfully even during high server load

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Simulated player activity generation for load testing
- Reproducible physics interaction scenarios
- AI behavior verification under throttling
- Transaction consistency verification

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 5,000 concurrent player sessions per server
- Game state update latency under 50ms for active players
- Physics calculations completed within 16ms frame budget
- Transaction processing guaranteed within 2 seconds

### Integration Points
- Game engine physics system
- AI behavior framework
- Player session management
- Transaction processing pipeline

### Key Constraints
- Must operate within fixed memory limits
- CPU utilization capped at 80% during normal operation
- Network bandwidth optimization for state updates
- Session persistence across server restarts

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Game Server Task Scheduler should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Task Classification and Prioritization**
   - Player-facing vs. background task classification
   - Dynamic priority calculation based on session factors
   - Critical path identification for gameplay responsiveness
   - Priority inheritance for dependent tasks

2. **Spatial Task Management**
   - Game world partitioning for workload distribution
   - Proximity-based task scheduling
   - Level-of-detail processing based on player attention
   - Spatial load balancing across processing units

3. **Resource Management**
   - CPU budget allocation between player and background tasks
   - Memory utilization optimization
   - Network bandwidth prioritization
   - Processing time guarantees for critical tasks

4. **Dynamic Scaling**
   - Load detection and prediction
   - Server capacity management
   - Session migration with state preservation
   - Graceful degradation under extreme load

5. **Transaction and Persistence**
   - Atomic operation guarantees
   - Persistent state management
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Consistency verification for critical transactions

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Player experience is prioritized during high server load
- Physics calculations are optimally distributed based on spatial partitioning
- AI processing dynamically adjusts based on server load
- Server load is balanced while maintaining session affinity
- Transactions are guaranteed to complete successfully

### Critical User Scenarios
- Sudden influx of players into a single game region
- Complex physics interactions during peak player activity
- Server-wide events requiring increased AI processing
- Load spikes during promotional events
- High volume of concurrent microtransactions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Game state update latency under 50ms for 99% of active players
- Physics processing within 16ms budget for 95% of frames
- AI throttling reduces CPU usage by at least 30% during peak load
- Load balancing maintains server utilization within 10% of optimal
- Transaction processing success rate of 99.99%

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitioning between server instances
- Physics calculation anomalies causing excessive CPU usage
- AI pathfinding edge cases
- Transaction system overload
- Memory exhaustion during complex game scenarios

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for priority calculation logic
- Complete testing of spatial partitioning algorithms
- Full verification of AI throttling mechanisms
- Comprehensive load balancing scenario coverage
- 100% coverage of transaction processing paths

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Active players experience consistent game state update latency under 50ms
2. Physics calculations remain within the 16ms frame budget during normal operation
3. AI processing intelligently scales based on available CPU capacity
4. Server load is balanced within 10% of optimal across instances
5. In-game transactions complete successfully 99.99% of the time
6. The system scales effectively to support 5,000+ concurrent player sessions
7. All tests pass, including edge cases and error conditions
8. The system gracefully degrades under extreme load conditions
