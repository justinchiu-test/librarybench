# Long-Term Climate Simulation Orchestration System

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed for managing large-scale scientific simulations that run continuously for months across hundreds of computing nodes. This system ensures reliable execution of complex climate models with comprehensive checkpointing, dependency tracking, and resilience to hardware failures.

## Persona Description
Dr. Jackson runs large-scale climate simulations requiring months of continuous computing across hundreds of nodes. His primary goal is to maximize research output by efficiently scheduling simulation tasks with checkpointing and fault tolerance.

## Key Requirements
1. **Long-Running Job Management with Preemption Protection**
   - Implement a job protection system that shields critical long-running simulations from preemption while allowing strategic pausing at safe checkpoints when absolutely necessary
   - Critical for Dr. Jackson because climate simulations can run for months, and unexpected termination can waste weeks of computation, requiring sophisticated management of which jobs can be paused and when

2. **Simulation Dependency Tracking with Stage Transitions**
   - Create a comprehensive dependency system that manages transitions between simulation stages (initialization, spin-up, main run, analysis) with validation between phases
   - Essential for Dr. Jackson's complex climate models which have distinct computational phases with different resource requirements, ensuring proper sequencing and validation between stages of multi-month simulations

3. **Equipment Failure Resilience with Minimal Recalculation**
   - Develop advanced fault tolerance that minimizes recalculation after node failures by maintaining distributed checkpoints and smart recovery strategies
   - Vital for maintaining progress in long-running simulations when hardware inevitably fails, avoiding costly restarts from the beginning by strategically placing checkpoints and implementing partial recovery mechanisms

4. **Resource Usage Forecasting for Planning**
   - Build a predictive resource usage system that provides accurate forecasting of computation needs for grant reporting and infrastructure planning
   - Important for Dr. Jackson to plan research budgets, justify resource allocations in grant proposals, and coordinate with computing center administrators on long-term infrastructure needs

5. **Scenario Priority Management Based on Preliminary Results**
   - Implement an adaptive priority system that adjusts resource allocation to simulation scenarios showing the most scientific promise based on preliminary results
   - Crucial for maximizing scientific output by directing computational resources to the most promising research directions, allowing dynamic adjustment of priorities as preliminary results emerge

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Long-running job components must be testable with accelerated time simulations
  - Dependency tracking must be verifiable with complex multi-stage pipelines
  - Fault tolerance must be testable through controlled failure injection
  - Resource forecasting must be validatable against historical usage patterns
  - Priority management must be testable with simulated preliminary results

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Checkpoint operations must complete within 5 minutes even for large memory states
  - Stage transitions must be validated and executed within 10 minutes
  - System must recover from node failures within 15 minutes with less than 1 hour of lost computation
  - Resource forecasting must predict usage with 90% accuracy for 6-month horizons
  - Priority adjustments must be calculated within 30 minutes of new result availability

- **Integration Points**
  - Scientific computing frameworks (NumPy, SciPy, etc.) for simulation libraries
  - MPI and parallel computing libraries for cross-node communication
  - Job scheduling systems (SLURM, PBS, etc.) for resource allocation
  - Storage systems for checkpointing and result persistence
  - Visualization tools for monitoring and result analysis

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must operate within high-performance computing center policies
  - Must coexist with other research workloads on shared infrastructure
  - Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing climate models
  - Must respect resource allocation grants and quotas
  - Implementation must be portable across different HPC environments

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a framework for defining, executing, and managing long-running scientific simulations as complex multi-stage workflows. It should implement intelligent scheduling algorithms that optimize for both scientific output and resource efficiency, with special attention to fault tolerance and checkpoint management.

Key components include:
1. A simulation definition system using Python decorators/functions for declaring multi-stage workflows
2. A long-running job manager that protects critical simulations from preemption
3. A dependency tracker that manages transitions between simulation stages
4. A fault tolerance system with distributed checkpointing and intelligent recovery
5. A resource forecasting engine that predicts future computation needs
6. An adaptive priority manager that adjusts allocations based on preliminary results

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Long-running job protection successfully shields simulations from unnecessary preemption
  - Dependency tracking correctly manages transitions between simulation stages
  - Fault tolerance effectively recovers from node failures with minimal recalculation
  - Resource forecasting accurately predicts computational needs
  - Priority management appropriately adjusts allocations based on scientific promise

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Managing a portfolio of climate scenarios running continuously for 6+ months
  - Handling the transition between initialization, spin-up, and main climate simulation
  - Recovering from hardware failures during critical simulation phases
  - Planning resource needs for upcoming grant-funded research projects
  - Dynamically adjusting priorities across multiple concurrent climate models

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - 99% reduction in simulation time lost to preemption vs. standard scheduling
  - Stage transition overhead less than 0.1% of total simulation time
  - Node failure recovery with less than 1% of computation time lost
  - Resource forecasting accuracy within 10% of actual usage
  - Simulation throughput increased by 30% through optimal priority management

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Recovery from catastrophic multi-node failure
  - Handling of corrupted checkpoint data
  - Management of resource shortages during critical simulation phases
  - Adaptation to unexpected simulation convergence issues
  - Graceful handling of storage system failures

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - >90% line coverage for all scheduler components
  - 100% coverage of checkpoint and recovery logic
  - 100% coverage of stage transition validation
  - >95% branch coverage for priority adjustment algorithms
  - Integration tests must verify end-to-end simulation workflows

## Success Criteria
- Climate simulation productivity increases by at least 40% with same resources
- Computation time lost to system failures reduces by 95%
- Resource utilization efficiency improves by at least 30%
- High-priority scenarios receive appropriate resource allocation 99% of the time
- Dr. Jackson's team can manage 3x more concurrent simulation scenarios
- Grant reporting and planning accuracy improves significantly
