# Video Processing Pipeline Scheduler

A concurrent task scheduler optimized for streaming video platforms that prioritizes content processing based on value and optimizes encoding pipelines.

## Overview

The Video Processing Pipeline Scheduler is a specialized task execution framework designed for video streaming platforms. It implements content-based prioritization, encoding recipe specialization, predictive resource allocation, processing deadline guarantees, and pipeline optimization to efficiently process thousands of video uploads while ensuring premium content receives priority treatment.

## Persona Description

Mateo works on a video streaming platform that processes thousands of video uploads while generating multiple encoding formats. His primary goal is to optimize the encoding pipeline for different content types while ensuring premium content gets priority treatment.

## Key Requirements

1. **Content Value-Based Prioritization**
   - Task prioritization system that dynamically adjusts processing order based on content value metrics with automatic tier adjustment
   - Critical for Mateo because high-value content (premium shows, trending uploads, etc.) should be processed first to maximize viewer engagement and platform revenue, with the ability to automatically promote viral content as it gains traction

2. **Encoding Recipe Specialization**
   - Customizable encoding pipeline configuration that selects optimal parameters based on content characteristics
   - Essential because different types of content (action scenes, talking heads, animation, etc.) require different encoding settings to achieve optimal quality and efficiency, requiring content-aware processing to maximize quality while minimizing bandwidth

3. **Predictive Resource Allocation**
   - Resource forecasting system that analyzes incoming content and proactively allocates processing capacity
   - Important for efficiently managing encoding resources by predicting processing requirements based on content characteristics, allowing for optimal resource allocation before processing begins

4. **Processing Deadline Guarantees**
   - Scheduling system that ensures content is available by specific deadlines with automatic quality adjustment to meet time constraints
   - Vital for scheduled releases and time-sensitive content where availability by a specific time is more important than perfect quality, requiring adaptive processing to balance quality and timeliness

5. **Multi-Stage Pipeline Optimization**
   - Pipeline management system that optimizes parallel processing across different encoding formats
   - Critical for maximizing throughput by intelligently scheduling different encoding formats (HD, 4K, HDR, etc.) to run in parallel when beneficial while avoiding resource contention

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Content analysis simulation for testing without actual video files
- Reproducible encoding scenarios with synthetic media
- Deadline scenario testing with time acceleration
- Pipeline performance measurement and verification

### Performance Expectations
- Support for processing at least 5,000 concurrent encoding tasks
- Priority adjustments applied within 30 seconds of content value changes
- Predictive resource allocation within 10% accuracy
- Deadline compliance rate of at least 99%

### Integration Points
- Video encoding software interfaces
- Content metadata and analytics systems
- CDN delivery preparation
- Scheduling and release management systems

### Key Constraints
- Fixed computational resources with no dynamic scaling
- Limited storage for intermediate processing results
- Maximum processing time guarantees for all content
- Support for multiple encoding formats and standards

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Video Processing Pipeline Scheduler should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Content Analysis and Classification**
   - Video characteristic analysis
   - Content value determination
   - Tier assignment and adjustment
   - Processing requirement estimation

2. **Encoding Strategy Management**
   - Content-specific encoding recipe selection
   - Quality parameter optimization
   - Format-specific processing configuration
   - Adaptive bitrate ladder generation

3. **Resource Planning and Allocation**
   - Processing capacity forecasting
   - Resource reservation and scheduling
   - Pipeline stage capacity balancing
   - Dynamic resource reallocation

4. **Deadline and Quality Management**
   - Time-constrained scheduling
   - Quality vs. time tradeoff decisions
   - Incremental quality improvement
   - Release time guarantee enforcement

5. **Pipeline Execution Control**
   - Multi-format parallel processing
   - Stage synchronization and dependency management
   - Progress monitoring and estimation
   - Failure recovery and partial result handling

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Content is processed according to value-based priority
- Encoding recipes are correctly matched to content characteristics
- Resource allocation accurately reflects content processing needs
- Processing deadlines are met with appropriate quality adjustments
- Multi-stage pipeline execution optimizes parallel processing opportunities

### Critical User Scenarios
- Premium content upload requiring rush processing
- Viral content auto-promotion and priority adjustment
- Mixed content types requiring different encoding approaches
- Scheduled release with strict deadline requirements
- Multiple formats generated from the same source content

### Performance Benchmarks
- Value-based prioritization reduces premium content processing time by 50%
- Specialized encoding recipes improve quality/bitrate ratio by at least 20%
- Predictive resource allocation improves overall throughput by 30%
- 99% of deadline-constrained content available on time
- Pipeline optimization increases encoding parallelism by at least 40%

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely large or complex video files
- Encoding failures requiring fallback strategies
- Resource contention during peak upload periods
- Deadline conflicts between high-priority content items
- Incompatible source formats requiring transcoding

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for prioritization algorithms
- Complete testing of encoding recipe selection logic
- Full coverage of resource allocation prediction
- Comprehensive deadline management scenario testing
- All pipeline parallelization strategies verified

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. High-value content is processed significantly faster than standard content
2. Content-specific encoding recipes demonstrably improve quality efficiency
3. Resource allocation predictions are accurate within 10% of actual requirements
4. At least 99% of deadline-constrained content is available on time
5. Parallel processing of encoding formats improves overall throughput by 40%
6. The system scales effectively to handle 5,000+ concurrent encoding tasks
7. All tests pass, including edge cases and error conditions
8. Processing resource utilization remains above 85% during normal operation
