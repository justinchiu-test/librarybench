# Unified Concurrent Task Scheduler Plan

## Overview
This directory contains a unified implementation of concurrent task scheduler functionality
that preserves the original package names from the following persona implementations:

- concurrent_task_scheduler_render_farm_manager
- concurrent_task_scheduler_scientific_computing

## Directory Structure
```
unified/
├── common/          # Common functionality across all implementations
│   └── core/        # Core data structures and algorithms
├── concurrent_task_scheduler
├── render_farm_manager
├── tests/
│   └── [persona]/   # Tests for each persona implementation
├── pyproject.toml
└── setup.py
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify common functionality across all persona implementations
2. Refactor into a shared common/core library
3. Gradually move shared functionality from original packages to common
4. Tests continue to work because original package structure is preserved
5. Eventually standardize on common interfaces across implementations

## Integration Strategy
- Original package names are preserved, so existing tests work without modification
- Common functionality is moved to the common package over time
- New code can directly use the common package
- Persona-specific extensions continue to live in their original packages
