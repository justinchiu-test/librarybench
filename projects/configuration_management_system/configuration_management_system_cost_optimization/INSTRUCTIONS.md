# Cloud Cost Optimization Configuration System

## Overview
A specialized configuration management library focused on optimizing cloud resource utilization and cost. This system analyzes the financial impact of configuration changes, provides rightsizing recommendations, implements time-based scaling rules, compares configurations across accounts, and offers cost-optimized configuration presets.

## Persona Description
Alex helps organizations optimize their cloud spending by identifying and adjusting resource configuration settings. His primary goal is to analyze configuration impact on cost and suggest modifications that maintain performance while reducing expenses.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cost Impact Analysis for Configuration Changes**
   - Predictive modeling of how configuration changes affect cloud costs
   - Before/after cost comparison for proposed changes
   - ROI calculation for configuration optimizations
   - This feature is critical for Alex to quantify the financial impact of configuration changes, allowing data-driven decisions about which optimizations to prioritize and helping to justify changes to stakeholders

2. **Resource Rightsizing Recommendations**
   - Analysis of resource utilization patterns against current configurations
   - Automated recommendations for optimal resource configurations
   - Confidence scoring for recommendations based on usage data
   - This feature helps Alex identify over-provisioned resources and suggest right-sized alternatives, often the largest source of potential cloud cost savings

3. **Scheduled Scaling Configurations**
   - Time-based configuration rules tied to business calendars
   - Automatic scaling based on predictable usage patterns
   - Business hours vs. off-hours configuration switching
   - This feature allows Alex to align resource allocation with actual business needs throughout the day, week, and year, reducing costs during periods of predictably low usage

4. **Multi-Account Configuration Comparison**
   - Cross-account analysis of similar resources
   - Identification of cost inefficiencies and inconsistencies
   - Best practice configuration propagation
   - This feature enables Alex to identify cost outliers across multiple accounts within an organization and standardize on cost-efficient configurations

5. **Cost-Performance Configuration Presets**
   - Predefined configuration templates optimized for different cost-performance tradeoffs
   - Performance modeling for different configuration options
   - Application-specific optimization profiles
   - This feature provides Alex with ready-to-use configurations that balance cost and performance needs for different scenarios, accelerating optimization efforts

## Technical Requirements
