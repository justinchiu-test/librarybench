# Multi-Environment Configuration Management System

## Overview
A hierarchical configuration management library designed specifically for DevOps professionals managing multi-environment, multi-cloud infrastructure deployments. This system enables consistent configuration management across development, staging, and production environments while providing tools to detect and remediate configuration drift, enforce environment-specific variations, and integrate with deployment pipelines.

## Persona Description
Sarah manages infrastructure for a rapidly growing SaaS company with multiple environments spanning development, staging, and production across three cloud providers. Her primary goal is to enforce consistent configuration across all environments while allowing for necessary environment-specific variations that don't break application compatibility.

## Key Requirements

1. **Configuration Drift Detection and Remediation**
   - Ability to compare configuration across environments and identify inconsistencies
   - Automated analysis to suggest remediation steps for inconsistent configurations
   - Tracking of intentional vs. unintentional configuration differences
   - This feature is critical for Sarah to maintain system reliability by preventing environment-specific bugs caused by unexpected configuration differences

2. **Multi-Cloud Provider Templating**
   - Support for cloud provider-specific variable substitution
   - Template system that allows defining configurations with provider-specific sections
   - Validation of templates against provider-specific schemas
   - This feature allows Sarah to maintain a single source of truth while deploying to AWS, Azure, and GCP with their unique configuration requirements

3. **Pipeline Integration with Pre-Deployment Validation**
   - API for CI/CD systems to validate configuration changes before deployment
   - Testing hooks to verify configuration compatibility with application versions
   - Reporting capabilities for integration into deployment approval workflows
   - This feature prevents configuration-related deployment failures by catching issues before they impact production systems

4. **Granular Permission Controls**
   - Role-based access control for configuration modifications by environment and section
   - Approval workflows for sensitive configuration changes
   - Audit logging of all configuration access and modifications
   - This feature allows Sarah to delegate configuration management responsibilities while maintaining appropriate access controls

5. **Configuration Health Dashboard**
   - Programmatic interface to evaluate configuration compliance across environments
   - Status tracking for configuration health metrics
   - Alerting capabilities for configuration compliance violations
   - This feature gives Sarah visibility into the overall health of the configuration ecosystem, allowing proactive management

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be fully testable without actual cloud provider dependencies
- Mock cloud provider interfaces for testing multi-cloud templating
- Test fixtures to simulate multi-environment deployments
- Property-based testing for configuration validation rules
- Configuration state snapshots for regression testing

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration retrieval latency under 50ms for cached configurations
- Support for handling 10,000+ configuration parameters across 100+ services
- Efficient delta-based comparison for drift detection (should complete in under 5 seconds for full environment comparison)
- Minimal memory footprint to support embedding in resource-constrained environments

### Integration Points
- Version control system integration (Git) for configuration history
- CI/CD pipeline hooks (via API or CLI)
- Cloud provider API interfaces (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Monitoring system integration for health metrics
- Notification systems for alerts and approval workflows

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without persistent network connectivity
- All sensitive data must support encryption at rest
- Configuration changes must be atomic and transactional
- Backward compatibility must be maintained for configuration schema changes
- No direct dependencies on specific cloud provider SDKs (use abstractions)

## Core Functionality

The library should provide:

1. **Hierarchical Configuration Management**
   - Define base configurations with environment-specific overrides
   - Support for inheritance and merging of configuration layers
   - Resolution of configuration values at runtime with caching

2. **Configuration Validation and Schema Management**
   - Schema definition for configuration parameters including types and constraints
   - Validation of configurations against schemas
   - Support for defining and enforcing cross-parameter constraints

3. **Configuration Storage and Versioning**
   - Storage backend abstraction for filesystem, database, or cloud-based storage
   - Version tracking and history of configuration changes
   - Support for tagging and labeling configuration versions

4. **Drift Detection and Analysis**
   - Comparison of configurations across environments
   - Differentiation between expected and unexpected variations
   - Remediation suggestion generation based on drift analysis

5. **Access Control and Auditing**
   - Permissions model for controlling access to configuration sections
   - Comprehensive audit logging of all configuration operations
   - Integration hooks for external authentication and authorization systems

6. **Cloud Provider Abstraction**
   - Provider-agnostic configuration templates
   - Provider-specific variable substitution
   - Validation against provider-specific requirements

7. **Monitoring and Health Reporting**
   - Configuration health metrics collection
   - Status reporting for compliance with defined rules
   - Alerting interfaces for compliance violations

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Configuration storage and retrieval
- Hierarchical override behavior
- Schema validation correctness
- Drift detection accuracy
- Permission enforcement
- Cloud provider template rendering
- Configuration versioning

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating and updating multi-environment configurations
- Detecting and remediating configuration drift
- Validating configurations before deployment
- Managing provider-specific configurations
- Controlling access to sensitive configuration sections
- Monitoring configuration health across environments

### Performance Benchmarks
- Configuration retrieval time under 50ms (cached)
- Drift analysis completion in under 5 seconds for complete environment
- Support for concurrent access from multiple services
- Memory usage below 100MB during operation

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of partial configuration updates
- Recovery from corrupted configuration data
- Behavior during network partitions
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates
- Graceful degradation when dependent services are unavailable

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% unit test coverage
- 100% coverage for schema validation logic
- Integration tests for all provider template scenarios
- Performance tests for all operations with defined benchmarks
- Chaos testing for error condition handling

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Configuration drift between environments is detected with 100% accuracy
2. Multi-cloud deployments can be managed from a single source of truth
3. Pre-deployment validation prevents at least 95% of configuration-related deployment failures
4. Access controls successfully prevent unauthorized configuration changes
5. Configuration health metrics provide actionable insights for proactive management
6. All specified performance benchmarks are consistently met

## Setup and Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv init --lib` to create a library project structure and set up the virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run specific tests with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Format code with `uv run ruff format`
6. Lint code with `uv run ruff check .`
7. Check types with `uv run pyright`

To use the library in your application:
