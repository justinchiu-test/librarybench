# Configuration Management System for DevOps Infrastructure

## Overview
A hierarchical configuration management system specifically designed for DevOps teams managing infrastructure across multiple environments and cloud providers. This system enforces consistent configuration while allowing environment-specific variations, provides drift detection, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines to validate configuration changes before deployment.

## Persona Description
Sarah manages infrastructure for a rapidly growing SaaS company with multiple environments spanning development, staging, and production across three cloud providers. Her primary goal is to enforce consistent configuration across all environments while allowing for necessary environment-specific variations that don't break application compatibility.

## Key Requirements
1. **Configuration Drift Detection with Automated Remediation Suggestions** - Continuously monitors all environments for configuration drift from defined baselines, promptly alerting Sarah when discrepancies are detected and providing intelligent remediation suggestions to bring configurations back into compliance. This is critical as undetected configuration drift is the primary cause of environment-specific bugs and security vulnerabilities in their multi-cloud infrastructure.

2. **Multi-cloud Provider Templating with Provider-specific Variable Substitution** - Provides templating functionality that allows defining core configurations once while automatically substituting provider-specific variables (AWS, Azure, GCP) when generating the final configurations. This eliminates duplication and ensures consistency across Sarah's multi-cloud environment while accommodating necessary provider-specific parameters.

3. **Pipeline Integration that Validates Configuration Changes Before Deployment** - Seamlessly integrates with CI/CD pipelines to validate configuration changes before deployment, catching potential issues early in the development process. This prevents invalid configurations from reaching production and causing service outages, a major concern for Sarah's growing SaaS platform.

4. **Granular Permission Controls Based on Environment and Configuration Section** - Implements role-based access control that restricts who can modify configurations based on both the environment (dev, staging, production) and the specific section of configuration being changed. This prevents unauthorized or accidental changes to sensitive production configurations while giving developers appropriate access to development environments.

5. **Configuration Health Dashboard Showing Compliance Across Environments** - Provides a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks configuration compliance across all environments, generating reports on configuration health, recent changes, and potential issues. This gives Sarah the visibility she needs to manage configuration at scale across numerous services and environments.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**: All components must be unit testable without external dependencies. Configuration validators, templating engine, and drift detection algorithms must have comprehensive test coverage. Mock interfaces must be provided for external services like cloud providers.

- **Performance Expectations**: Configuration validation operations must complete in under 500ms, even with complex hierarchical configurations. Drift detection systems must handle at least 1000 configuration properties across 50 environments with minimal resource usage.

- **Integration Points**: 
  - Must provide hooks for integration with common CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
  - Must support standard configuration formats (YAML, JSON, TOML)
  - Must include adapters for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

- **Key Constraints**: 
  - Must operate effectively in air-gapped environments
  - Must support offline operation for local validation
  - Must handle highly hierarchical configurations (up to 5 levels of inheritance)
  - Must preserve comments and formatting in configuration files when possible

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality required for this DevOps-focused configuration management system includes:

1. **Hierarchical Configuration Engine**: 
   - Support for multi-level inheritance of configuration properties
   - Clear resolution of configuration values when overridden at different levels
   - Ability to trace where each configuration value originated from

2. **Multi-Cloud Templating System**:
   - Template format that allows provider-specific sections
   - Variable substitution mechanism for different cloud environments
   - Support for conditional logic in templates

3. **Drift Detection and Remediation**:
   - Algorithms to detect when actual configuration differs from expected
   - System to suggest specific remediation steps for each type of drift
   - Historical tracking of drift patterns for predictive analysis

4. **CI/CD Integration Framework**:
   - Validators that can run in pipeline environments
   - Exit code handling for pipeline integration
   - Structured output formats for pipeline consumption

5. **Access Control System**:
   - Fine-grained permission model for configuration sections
   - Environment-based access rules
   - Audit logging of all configuration changes

6. **Compliance Monitoring**:
   - Continuous evaluation of configurations against policy rules
   - Reporting capabilities for compliance status
   - Alerting system for compliance violations

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive pytest tests that validate all aspects of the system:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct hierarchical resolution of configuration values
  - Accurate drift detection across various drift scenarios
  - Proper variable substitution for different cloud providers
  - Correct enforcement of access control rules
  - Accurate reporting of configuration health metrics

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - New environment provisioning with template inheritance
  - Configuration changes that propagate across environments
  - Detecting and remediating configuration drift
  - Enforcing access controls during configuration updates
  - Validating configuration changes in a CI/CD pipeline

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Configuration resolution must complete within 100ms for typical hierarchies
  - Drift detection must process 500 configuration items within 2 seconds
  - System must handle at least 100 concurrent validation requests
  - Template rendering must complete within 200ms for complex templates

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Circular inheritance references
  - Malformed configuration files
  - Conflicting override directives
  - Network failures during cloud provider operations
  - Incomplete or invalid templates

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all core modules
  - 100% coverage of critical functions such as inheritance resolution
  - All public APIs must have integration tests
  - All error handling paths must be tested

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All tests pass consistently, demonstrating that the system correctly implements all required functionality.
2. The system can handle the specified performance requirements, validating its scalability for enterprise environments.
3. Configuration drift detection correctly identifies discrepancies between expected and actual configurations.
4. The templating system successfully generates provider-specific configurations while maintaining the core configuration.
5. Access controls effectively limit configuration modifications based on environment and section.
6. Configuration health reporting provides accurate insights into the state of all environments.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up the development environment:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using `uv venv`
3. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file must be submitted as evidence that all tests pass successfully.
