# Configuration Management System for Edge Computing

## Overview
A specialized configuration management system designed for edge computing environments where thousands of distributed devices operate with limited connectivity and unique local requirements. The system provides efficient configuration synchronization, offline capabilities, and intelligent device fleet management while optimizing for bandwidth and power constraints.

## Persona Description
Mateo develops systems that run on thousands of edge devices with limited connectivity and unique local requirements. His primary goal is to manage device configurations efficiently while allowing for local adaptations when devices are offline.

## Key Requirements

1. **Bandwidth-efficient configuration delta synchronization**: The system must minimize data transfer by only synchronizing configuration changes rather than complete configurations. This is critical for edge devices operating on cellular, satellite, or other limited bandwidth connections where data costs are high and throughput is constrained, ensuring configuration updates don't overwhelm network capacity or incur excessive costs.

2. **Offline mode with local override capabilities and conflict resolution**: The system must allow edge devices to operate autonomously when disconnected, making local configuration adjustments as needed, then intelligently resolve conflicts when connectivity is restored. This feature is essential because edge devices frequently lose connectivity due to location, weather, or network issues, yet must continue operating with the ability to adapt to local conditions.

3. **Device group management with inheritance for regional settings**: The system must organize devices into hierarchical groups with configuration inheritance, allowing regional or category-specific settings to cascade down while permitting device-specific overrides. This is crucial for managing thousands of devices efficiently, where many share common configurations based on location, purpose, or capabilities, avoiding the need to configure each device individually.

4. **Telemetry-driven configuration optimization for power and performance**: The system must collect device telemetry to automatically adjust configurations for optimal power consumption and performance based on actual usage patterns. This enables the system to extend battery life on power-constrained devices and improve performance where needed, adapting to real-world conditions rather than relying on static configurations.

5. **Failure-resistant configuration updates with staged rollout to device fleets**: The system must implement robust update mechanisms that can handle intermittent connectivity, partial downloads, and device failures during updates. This includes staged rollouts to subsets of the fleet to validate changes before full deployment, preventing fleet-wide failures from problematic configurations and ensuring devices can recover from failed updates.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All synchronization algorithms must be unit testable with simulated network conditions
- Offline operation and conflict resolution must be verifiable through automated tests
- Device grouping and inheritance logic must be testable with various hierarchy structures
- Telemetry analysis and optimization algorithms must be deterministic and testable
- Update mechanisms must be testable with simulated failure scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration delta calculation must complete within 100ms for typical changes
- Conflict resolution must process within 1 second for devices offline up to 7 days
- Device group operations must handle hierarchies with 10,000+ devices efficiently
- Telemetry processing must analyze data from 1,000 devices within 30 seconds
- Configuration updates must resume within 5 seconds after connectivity restoration

### Integration Points
- Device management platforms for fleet organization
- Telemetry collection systems for performance data
- Network monitoring tools for connectivity status
- Security systems for device authentication
- Analytics platforms for fleet-wide insights

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with intermittent connectivity (devices offline for days/weeks)
- Configuration updates must work over connections as slow as 2G cellular
- Must handle devices with limited storage (as low as 1MB for configurations)
- Power consumption for configuration operations must be minimal
- Must support devices running various embedded operating systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The configuration management system for edge computing must provide:

1. **Delta Sync Engine**: An efficient synchronization system that calculates minimal configuration differences and compresses them for transmission. This includes binary diff algorithms, compression optimized for configuration data, and checksum validation to ensure integrity over unreliable connections.

2. **Offline Configuration Manager**: A local configuration system that maintains device operation during disconnection, logs local changes, and implements sophisticated conflict resolution strategies when reconnecting. This includes priority-based conflict resolution and merge strategies for different configuration types.

3. **Fleet Hierarchy System**: A scalable device organization framework supporting multi-level grouping with inheritance, override rules, and efficient propagation of group-level changes. This includes support for dynamic group membership based on device characteristics or location.

4. **Telemetry Optimizer**: An intelligent system that analyzes device performance metrics to suggest and apply configuration optimizations. This includes pattern recognition for usage anomalies, power optimization algorithms, and performance tuning based on workload characteristics.

5. **Resilient Update Framework**: A robust update system designed for unreliable networks, supporting resumable downloads, automatic rollback on failure, and staged rollouts with canary deployments. This includes update scheduling based on connectivity windows and battery levels.

## Testing Requirements

- Accurate delta calculation and compression for various configuration changes
- Proper offline operation with local changes preserved and synced
- Correct configuration inheritance through device group hierarchies
- Effective telemetry-based optimization decisions
- Reliable update delivery despite network and device failures

### Critical User Scenarios to Test
- Updating configuration on 10,000 devices with varying connectivity
- Device operating offline for 30 days then reconnecting with local changes
- Regional configuration change affecting 1,000 devices across groups
- Automatic power optimization based on battery depletion patterns
- Staged rollout detecting and halting problematic configuration update

### Performance Benchmarks
- Delta sync must handle 100KB configuration with 1KB change in under 2 seconds on 3G
- Offline conflict resolution for 100 local changes must complete within 5 seconds
- Group configuration change must propagate to 5,000 devices within 1 minute
- Telemetry analysis for 10,000 devices must complete within 2 minutes
- Failed update recovery must resume within 10 seconds of reconnection

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling devices with corrupted local configurations
- Managing conflicts when device time is significantly wrong

- Handling storage exhaustion during configuration updates
- Managing authentication failures after extended offline periods

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all synchronization modules
- 100% coverage for offline operation and conflict resolution
- Comprehensive tests for all network failure scenarios
- Full coverage of device group inheritance logic
- Stress tests for large-scale fleet operations

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Configuration updates use 90% less bandwidth compared to full configuration transfers, with delta synchronization completing successfully over connections as slow as 20kbps.

2. **Offline Resilience**: Devices operate normally for at least 30 days offline, preserving all local configuration changes and successfully reconciling them upon reconnection with conflict resolution succeeding in 99% of cases.

3. **Fleet Management Scale**: The system efficiently manages 100,000+ devices organized in complex hierarchies, with group configuration changes propagating to all affected devices within 5 minutes of initiation.

4. **Optimization Impact**: Telemetry-driven optimizations reduce average device power consumption by 25% and improve performance metrics by 15% compared to static configurations.

5. **Update Reliability**: Configuration updates succeed on 99.5% of devices within 24 hours despite network issues, with automatic rollback preventing any devices from entering failed states due to bad configurations.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Implementation Notes

When implementing this system, use `uv venv` to set up the virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`.

Remember that this implementation should focus on providing a robust API for edge device configuration management without any user interface components. All interactions should be programmable and fully testable through pytest.
