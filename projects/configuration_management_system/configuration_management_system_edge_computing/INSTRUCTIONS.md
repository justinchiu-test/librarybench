# Edge Device Configuration Management System

## Overview
A specialized configuration management library designed for distributed edge computing environments with limited connectivity. This system enables efficient management of device configurations through bandwidth-optimized synchronization, offline capabilities with conflict resolution, device grouping with inheritance, telemetry-driven optimization, and staged rollout strategies.

## Persona Description
Mateo develops systems that run on thousands of edge devices with limited connectivity and unique local requirements. His primary goal is to manage device configurations efficiently while allowing for local adaptations when devices are offline.

## Key Requirements

1. **Bandwidth-Efficient Configuration Delta Synchronization**
   - Differential configuration updates that transmit only changed values
   - Compression and binary encoding for configuration data
   - Priority-based synchronization for critical vs. non-critical parameters
   - This feature is critical for Mateo to manage configurations across thousands of devices with limited or metered connectivity, minimizing data transfer while maintaining configuration consistency

2. **Offline Mode with Local Override Capabilities**
   - Support for device operation during disconnected periods
   - Local configuration adaptation within defined constraints
   - Conflict resolution when reconnecting to central management
   - This feature enables edge devices to continue functioning when disconnected from the central management system, making local configuration adaptations as needed while reconciling changes upon reconnection

3. **Device Group Management with Regional Inheritance**
   - Hierarchical device grouping with configuration inheritance
   - Regional, functional, and hardware-based grouping strategies
   - Override management between group and device-specific settings
   - This feature allows Mateo to efficiently manage devices with similar characteristics through shared configurations while supporting necessary variations by region, function, or hardware capabilities

4. **Telemetry-Driven Configuration Optimization**
   - Collection and analysis of device performance metrics
   - Automated configuration adjustments based on device conditions
   - Optimization for power consumption and performance trade-offs
   - This feature helps Mateo's edge devices autonomously optimize their configurations based on real-world conditions like battery status, network quality, and workload, extending device life and improving performance

5. **Failure-Resistant Configuration Updates with Staged Rollout**
   - Phased deployment of configuration changes across device fleets
   - Automatic rollback on failed updates or performance degradation
   - Canary testing strategies for new configuration profiles
   - This feature ensures safe deployment of configuration changes across large device fleets by testing changes on a small subset first and automatically rolling back problematic updates before they affect the entire fleet

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Simulation framework for testing bandwidth optimization
