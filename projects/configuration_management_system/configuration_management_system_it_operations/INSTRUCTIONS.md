# Global IT Configuration Management System

## Overview
A configuration management library designed for global IT operations with diverse geographic requirements and compliance needs. This system enables centralized management of IT configurations while supporting region-specific variations, regulatory compliance mapping, scheduled configuration changes, and infrastructure inventory integration.

## Persona Description
Diego oversees IT systems for a global corporation with location-specific requirements and varying compliance regulations. His primary goal is to manage configuration variations across geographic regions while maintaining a core set of corporate standards.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geographic Configuration Inheritance**
   - Hierarchical configuration model with global, regional, and local levels
   - Region-specific override capabilities while enforcing corporate standards
   - Conflict resolution for competing configuration directives
   - This feature is critical for Diego to maintain consistent IT operations globally while accommodating necessary regional variations due to local regulations, business practices, and technical constraints

2. **Scheduled Configuration Changes with Timezone Awareness**
   - Time-based configuration activation and deactivation
   - Timezone-aware scheduling of configuration changes
   - Coordinated rollout of changes across different regions
   - This feature allows Diego to implement configuration changes during appropriate maintenance windows for each region, minimizing business disruption while ensuring timely updates

3. **Regulatory Compliance Mapping by Jurisdiction**
   - Configuration rule sets mapped to specific regulatory frameworks
   - Jurisdiction-based compliance validation
   - Automatic detection of compliance violations
   - This feature helps Diego ensure that IT configurations comply with diverse regulatory requirements across different countries and regions, reducing compliance risk

4. **Configuration Deployment Windows**
   - Definition of allowed deployment periods by region and system type
   - Automated scheduling of configuration updates
   - Blackout period enforcement for critical business functions
   - This feature enables Diego to control when configuration changes can be deployed, respecting business hours, critical operations periods, and maintenance windows across different timezones

5. **Infrastructure Inventory Integration**
   - Connection with CMDB or inventory management systems
   - Real-time configuration status mapped to infrastructure items
   - Deployment target filtering by device attributes
   - This feature gives Diego visibility into the current configuration state of all IT assets and helps target configuration changes to relevant infrastructure components

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Timezone simulation capabilities for testing scheduled operations
- Mocked inventory system for testing infrastructure integration
- Test fixtures for geographic hierarchy validation
- Compliance rule testing framework
- Time-based test execution for schedule verification

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration resolution under 50ms even with complex inheritance
- Support for 10,000+ infrastructure items with unique configurations
- Efficient validation against multiple compliance frameworks (< 5 seconds)
- Schedule calculation and validation under 100ms

### Integration Points
- IT Service Management (ITSM) systems
- Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
- Asset management and inventory systems
- Change management and approval workflows
- Compliance and audit reporting systems
- Monitoring and alert systems

### Key Constraints
- Support for disconnected operations in regions with limited connectivity
- Minimal bandwidth requirements for remote locations
- Backward compatibility with legacy systems
- Configuration conflicts must never result in system unavailability
- Support for emergency override of scheduling constraints

## Core Functionality

The library should provide:

1. **Geographic Configuration Hierarchy**
   - Multi-level inheritance model aligned with organizational structure
   - Regional and local override mechanisms
   - Conflict resolution strategies with priority rules
   - Effective configuration calculation based on geographic context

2. **Time-Based Configuration Management**
   - Schedule definition for configuration activation
   - Timezone management and conversion
   - Validation of schedule consistency
   - Coordinated deployment planning

3. **Compliance Rule Management**
   - Definition of compliance rule sets by regulatory framework
   - Mapping of rules to geographic jurisdictions
   - Validation of configurations against applicable rules
   - Compliance reporting and violation tracking

4. **Deployment Window Management**
   - Definition of allowed deployment periods
   - Blackout period management
   - Automated schedule generation based on constraints
   - Schedule adherence enforcement

5. **Infrastructure Integration**
   - Inventory system connection and synchronization
   - Configuration status tracking by device
   - Targeting rules based on device attributes
   - Deployment validation against inventory

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Geographic inheritance and override resolution
- Timezone-aware scheduling behavior
- Compliance validation against regulatory frameworks
- Deployment window enforcement
- Infrastructure inventory integration

### Critical User Scenarios
- Managing global configuration with regional variations
- Scheduling coordinated configuration changes across timezones
- Ensuring compliance with diverse regulatory requirements
- Controlling when and where configuration changes can be deployed
- Tracking configuration status across the infrastructure inventory

### Performance Benchmarks
- Configuration resolution under 50ms regardless of inheritance depth
- Support for 10,000+ infrastructure items
- Compliance validation under 5 seconds for complete configuration set
- Schedule calculation under 100ms even for complex deployment plans

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of conflicting regional configuration requirements
- Behavior during schedule transitions and timezone changes
- Recovery from failed deployments across multiple regions
- Resolution of compliance conflicts between competing regulations
- Operations during inventory system unavailability

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% unit test coverage for all core functionality
- 100% coverage for geographic inheritance resolution logic
- Timezone handling tested across all major global regions
- Integration tests with mocked inventory systems
- Performance tests simulating global-scale deployment

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. IT configurations are consistently managed across all geographic regions while accommodating necessary local variations
2. Configuration changes are deployed according to appropriate regional schedules without business disruption
3. Configurations comply with all applicable regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction
4. Configuration deployments respect defined deployment windows and blackout periods
5. The system provides accurate visibility into configuration status across the entire infrastructure inventory
6. Administration overhead for managing global configurations is reduced by at least 50%

## Setup and Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv init --lib` to create a library project structure and set up the virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run specific tests with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Format code with `uv run ruff format`
6. Lint code with `uv run ruff check .`
7. Check types with `uv run pyright`

To use the library in your application:
1. Install the package with `uv pip install -e .` in development or specify it as a dependency in your project
2. Import the library modules in your code to leverage the global IT configuration management functionality
