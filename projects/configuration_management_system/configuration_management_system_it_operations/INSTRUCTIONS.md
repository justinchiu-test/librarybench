# Global Configuration Governance System

## Overview
A configuration management system designed for global IT operations with region-specific requirements and compliance regulations. The system enables centralized management of configurations with geographic variations, scheduled changes with timezone awareness, and regulatory compliance mapping to ensure adherence to local requirements.

## Persona Description
Diego oversees IT systems for a global corporation with location-specific requirements and varying compliance regulations. His primary goal is to manage configuration variations across geographic regions while maintaining a core set of corporate standards.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geographic Configuration Inheritance with Region-specific Overrides**
   - Implement a hierarchical model with geographic inheritance (global → regional → country → site)
   - Support region-specific overrides that maintain core standards while accommodating local needs
   - Essential for Diego to ensure consistent corporate standards while adapting to regional requirements without duplicating configuration effort

2. **Scheduled Configuration Changes with Timezone Awareness**
   - Create a scheduling system for configuration changes that accounts for different timezones
   - Include capabilities for coordinating changes across regions
   - Critical for Diego to manage configuration updates that minimize business impact by respecting local business hours and peak usage times across global operations

3. **Regulatory Compliance Mapping by Jurisdiction**
   - Develop a compliance mapping system that links configurations to specific regulatory requirements
   - Support different regulatory frameworks by geographic location
   - Vital for Diego to ensure all systems comply with local regulations such as GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, and industry-specific requirements in different countries

4. **Configuration Deployment Windows with Automated Scheduling**
   - Build an automated scheduling system that enforces approved deployment windows
   - Include capabilities for emergency deployments with appropriate approvals
   - Necessary for Diego to ensure configuration changes occur only during authorized periods, reducing risk to business operations while providing flexibility for urgent changes

5. **Infrastructure Inventory Integration Showing Configuration Status per Device**
   - Implement integration with infrastructure inventory systems to track configuration status
   - Support device-level configuration reporting and compliance status
   - Crucial for Diego to maintain visibility across the global infrastructure and quickly identify non-compliant or out-of-date devices

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Geographic inheritance must be fully testable with simulated regional hierarchies
- Timezone scheduling must be tested against all supported timezones
- Compliance mapping must verify configurations against mock regulatory requirements
- Deployment window enforcement must be thoroughly tested for all scenarios
- Inventory integration must be testable with mock inventory data

### Performance Expectations
- Geographic hierarchy operations must complete within 200ms regardless of depth
- Scheduling operations must process 1000+ scheduled changes in under 1 second
- Compliance verification must check 10,000+ configuration items against regulatory frameworks in under 10 seconds
- Deployment window enforcement must make decisions in under 50ms
- Inventory status updates must process 1000+ devices per second

### Integration Points
- Integration with enterprise inventory management systems
- Support for regulatory compliance frameworks and validation tools
- Hooks for change management and approval systems
- Compatibility with monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Support for infrastructure-as-code platforms across regions

### Key Constraints
- Must support offline operation for remote locations with limited connectivity
- Geographic variations must not compromise core security requirements
- Regulatory models must be updatable without system downtime
- System must operate across diverse infrastructure (legacy and modern)
- Must support multiple languages for global operations teams

## Core Functionality

The Global Configuration Governance System should implement:

1. A geographic inheritance model that:
   - Defines a hierarchy of configuration scopes (global, regional, country, site)
   - Applies configurations through inheritance with appropriate overrides
   - Resolves conflicts according to defined priority rules
   - Tracks the source of each configuration setting for auditing

2. A timezone-aware scheduling system that:
   - Manages configuration change schedules across global timezones
   - Coordinates related changes across regions
   - Provides calendar views of planned changes by region
   - Sends notifications to relevant stakeholders in their local timezone

3. A regulatory compliance framework that:
   - Maps configuration requirements to specific regulations
   - Verifies configurations against applicable regulatory standards
   - Supports multiple concurrent regulatory frameworks
   - Generates compliance reports by jurisdiction

4. A deployment window management system that:
   - Defines allowed time periods for configuration changes
   - Enforces restrictions based on business impact
   - Provides override mechanisms for emergency situations
   - Logs all deployments with full context and approvals

5. An inventory integration framework that:
   - Connects with infrastructure inventory systems
   - Tracks configuration status across all devices
   - Identifies non-compliant or outdated devices
   - Provides aggregated status views by region, type, or compliance status

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Geographic inheritance correctly applies configurations across the hierarchy
- Scheduled changes respect timezone differences and execute at appropriate local times
- Compliance mapping correctly identifies regulatory requirements for each region
- Deployment windows properly control when configuration changes can be applied
- Inventory integration accurately reflects configuration status across devices

### Critical User Scenarios
- Global configuration change properly propagates with appropriate regional variations
- Scheduled maintenance window correctly executes in each timezone without overlap
- Configuration change is validated against regional regulatory requirements
- Change request outside approved window is blocked and requires appropriate override
- Non-compliant devices are identified and reported through inventory integration

### Performance Benchmarks
- Geographic model performance remains consistent with increasing hierarchy complexity
- Scheduling system handles high volumes of changes across multiple timezones
- Compliance verification scales efficiently with increasing regulatory complexity
- Deployment window enforcement maintains performance during high-volume change periods
- Inventory status updates remain performant with large device counts

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- System handles conflicts between regional overrides appropriately
- Scheduling system manages daylight saving time transitions correctly
- Compliance system addresses conflicting regulatory requirements gracefully
- Deployment window system manages timezone edge cases properly
- Inventory integration handles disconnected or unreachable devices gracefully

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Geographic inheritance logic must be tested with complex nested hierarchies
- Timezone handling must be tested across all global timezones including DST transitions
- Compliance verification must be tested against multiple regulatory frameworks
- Deployment window enforcement must be tested for all edge cases and override scenarios
- Inventory integration must be tested with diverse device types and statuses

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Configuration consistency is maintained globally while accommodating necessary regional variations
2. Scheduled changes occur at appropriate times in each region's timezone without business disruption
3. All regional configurations comply with their specific regulatory requirements
4. Configuration changes adhere to defined deployment windows with appropriate controls
5. Device configuration status is accurately tracked and reported through inventory integration
6. The system enables efficient global governance while respecting regional autonomy
7. Compliance reporting satisfies audit requirements across all jurisdictions
8. Configuration deployment causes minimal business disruption through proper scheduling
