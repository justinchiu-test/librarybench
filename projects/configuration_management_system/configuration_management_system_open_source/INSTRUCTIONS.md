# Flexible Open Source Configuration Framework

## Overview
A highly adaptable configuration management library designed for open source frameworks used in diverse environments. This system enables flexible configuration options with strong backward compatibility guarantees, community-contributed templates, telemetry-driven optimization, interactive documentation, and version upgrade path simulation.

## Persona Description
Priya maintains a popular open source framework used in diverse environments from individual developers to enterprise deployments. Her primary goal is to provide flexible configuration options that work across many use cases while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Requirements

1. **Community-Contributed Configuration Templates**
   - Support for sharing and reusing configuration templates
   - Rating and review system for templates
   - Metadata for categorizing templates by use case
   - This feature is critical for Priya to leverage community knowledge, allowing users to share optimized configurations for specific use cases and environments, reducing support burden and improving user experience

2. **Backward Compatibility Analyzer**
   - Detection of breaking changes in configuration schemas
   - Compatibility reporting across framework versions
   - Migration assistance for configuration updates
   - This feature ensures that configuration changes don't break existing deployments when users upgrade, maintaining the framework's reputation for stability and reliability

3. **Default Value Optimization**
   - Anonymous, opt-in telemetry collection on configuration usage
   - Statistical analysis of most effective default values
   - Data-driven configuration recommendations
   - This feature helps Priya optimize default configuration values based on real-world usage patterns, improving out-of-the-box experience for most users

4. **Interactive Documentation**
   - Configuration option documentation with impact explanations
   - Contextual help for configuration decisions
   - Examples tailored to common use cases
   - This feature enables users to make informed configuration choices by understanding the impacts and trade-offs of different options, reducing support requests and configuration errors

5. **Version Upgrade Path Simulation**
   - Predictive analysis of configuration changes required during upgrades
   - Simulation of configuration behavior across versions
   - Automated migration plan generation
   - This feature allows users to understand how configuration needs to change when upgrading framework versions, making upgrades smoother and reducing version lock-in

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Comprehensive property-based testing for configuration resolution
- Parameterized tests covering diverse environment scenarios
- Test fixtures for common configuration patterns
- Framework for testing backward compatibility guarantees
- Simulation testing for upgrade paths

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration resolution under 10ms for typical configurations
- Support for thousands of configuration parameters
- Minimal memory footprint for embedded usage
- Efficient telemetry data processing in background threads

### Integration Points
- Version control systems for configuration history
- Package management systems for version detection
- Documentation generators for interactive docs
- Telemetry collection endpoints (with privacy controls)
- Community platforms for template sharing

### Key Constraints
- Must work in environments with minimal dependencies
- Configuration must be serializable in common formats (JSON, YAML, TOML)
- No breaking changes to configuration API between minor versions
- Telemetry must be strictly opt-in and anonymized
- Must support Python 3.7+ for broad compatibility

## Core Functionality

The library should provide:

1. **Flexible Configuration System**
   - Multiple configuration sources with priority ordering
   - Environment-specific configuration resolution
   - Dynamic reloading capabilities
   - Support for various configuration formats

2. **Template Management**
   - Template definition format with metadata
   - Sharing and discovery mechanisms
   - Rating and review infrastructure
   - Template application with customization

3. **Compatibility Management**
   - Schema versioning with semantic versioning support
   - Compatibility checking between versions
   - Deprecation marking and warning system
   - Migration assistance tools

4. **Telemetry and Optimization**
   - Anonymous usage data collection (opt-in)
   - Statistical analysis of configuration effectiveness
   - Recommendation engine for optimal values
   - Feedback mechanism for configuration issues

5. **Documentation Generation**
   - Dynamic documentation from configuration schemas
   - Impact analysis for configuration options
   - Example generation based on common patterns
   - Contextual help system

6. **Version Management**
   - Framework version detection
   - Configuration difference analysis between versions
   - Upgrade path planning
   - Automated migration assistance

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Configuration resolution from multiple sources
- Template application and customization
- Backward compatibility validation
- Telemetry collection and analysis
- Documentation generation accuracy
- Upgrade path simulation correctness

### Critical User Scenarios
- Applying community templates to new projects
- Upgrading framework versions with existing configurations
- Contributing optimized configurations back to the community
- Understanding configuration impacts through documentation
- Planning migration paths for major version upgrades

### Performance Benchmarks
- Configuration resolution under 10ms (cached)
- Template application under 50ms
- Compatibility analysis under 500ms for complex schemas
- Support for projects with 1000+ configuration parameters

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of incompatible configuration combinations
- Recovery from corrupted configuration files
- Backward compatibility with very old framework versions
- Behavior with incomplete or partially specified configurations
- Graceful degradation when optional features are unavailable

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% unit test coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage for compatibility checking algorithms
- Parameterized tests covering all supported Python versions
- Performance tests for all time-sensitive operations
- Regression tests for all previously reported configuration issues

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Community members actively share and use configuration templates
2. Framework upgrades rarely break existing configurations
3. Default configuration values work well for most users out of the box
4. Users can make informed configuration decisions through interactive documentation
5. Version upgrades are smooth with clear migration paths for configuration changes
6. Support requests related to configuration issues decrease significantly

## Setup and Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv init --lib` to create a library project structure and set up the virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run specific tests with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Format code with `uv run ruff format`
6. Lint code with `uv run ruff check .`
7. Check types with `uv run pyright`

To use the library in your application:
1. Install the package with `uv pip install -e .` in development or specify it as a dependency in your project
2. Import the library modules in your code to leverage the open source configuration framework functionality
