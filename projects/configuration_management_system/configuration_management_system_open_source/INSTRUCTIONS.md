# Open Source Configuration Management System

## Overview
A flexible configuration management system designed for open source projects with diverse user bases, from individual developers to enterprise deployments. This system supports community-contributed templates, backward compatibility analysis, telemetry-based default optimization, interactive documentation, and upgrade path simulation to ensure smooth transitions between versions.

## Persona Description
Priya maintains a popular open source framework used in diverse environments from individual developers to enterprise deployments. Her primary goal is to provide flexible configuration options that work across many use cases while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Requirements
1. **Community-contributed Configuration Templates with Rating System** - Provides a platform for users to contribute, share, and rate configuration templates for different use cases, environments, and scenarios. This is critical for Priya because it leverages the diverse experience of the community to create a comprehensive library of best-practice configurations that cover far more scenarios than she could develop alone, making the framework more accessible to new users.

2. **Backward Compatibility Analyzer for Configuration Schema Changes** - Implements automated analysis that detects when proposed changes to configuration schemas would break backward compatibility, with detailed reports on the impact. This addresses Priya's need to evolve the framework without breaking existing user implementations, preserving trust in the project while allowing innovation.

3. **Default Value Optimization Based on Telemetry from Opt-in Users** - Collects anonymous usage telemetry from opt-in users to identify optimal default values for configuration parameters across different environments and use cases. This helps Priya ensure that out-of-the-box configurations perform well for most users without manual tuning, improving the initial experience with the framework.

4. **Interactive Documentation that Explains Configuration Option Impacts** - Creates dynamic, context-aware documentation that explains the purpose, impact, and relationships between configuration options. This addresses the challenge that Priya's framework has hundreds of configuration options with complex interdependencies that are difficult for users to understand through static documentation.

5. **Upgrade Path Simulation Showing Configuration Changes Between Versions** - Provides a simulation tool that shows users exactly how their configurations would change during an upgrade, highlighting deprecated options, new features, and required modifications. This addresses one of Priya's biggest support burdens: helping users upgrade between major versions without disruption to their implementations.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**: Template sharing and rating system must be testable without external services. Backward compatibility analysis must have comprehensive test cases covering all breaking change patterns. Telemetry processing algorithms must be verifiable with synthetic data.

- **Performance Expectations**: Compatibility analysis must complete within 10 seconds even for complex configuration schemas. Documentation generation must be fast enough for interactive use, with sub-second response times. Upgrade simulations must complete within 5 seconds.

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must provide a pluggable telemetry system with privacy controls
  - Must integrate with standard documentation formats and generators
  - Must support standard version control systems
  - Must provide APIs for community platform integration

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must respect user privacy with clear opt-in for telemetry
  - Must work in offline environments
  - Must be accessible to non-technical users
  - Must accommodate both simple and highly complex configurations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

  - Optimizing default values based on usage patterns
  - Exploring configuration options through interactive documentation
  - Planning and executing version upgrades

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Template system must handle 1000+ community templates efficiently
  - Compatibility analysis must process complex schemas within 10 seconds
  - Telemetry analysis must handle data from 10,000+ installations
  - Documentation system must generate responses within 500ms
  - Upgrade simulation must handle configuration files up to 10MB

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling conflicting community templates
  - Detecting subtle compatibility issues
  - Processing skewed or anomalous telemetry data
  - Generating documentation for unusual configurations
  - Simulating upgrades across multiple major versions

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage of compatibility analysis logic
  - All telemetry processing algorithms must have test cases
  - All documentation generation paths must be tested
  - All upgrade simulation scenarios must be verified

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The community template system effectively manages shared configuration templates with ratings.
2. The backward compatibility analyzer accurately identifies breaking changes in configuration schemas.
3. The telemetry system optimizes default values based on real-world usage patterns.
4. The interactive documentation clearly explains configuration option impacts.
5. The upgrade path simulation accurately shows configuration changes between versions.
6. All specified performance benchmarks are met consistently.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
