# Release-Oriented Configuration Management System

## Overview
A specialized configuration management library designed for coordinating software releases across multiple teams and environments. This system enables atomic deployment of configuration bundles, configuration freeze periods, progressive rollouts with automatic rollback capabilities, feature flag integration, and inter-team dependency mapping for coordinated releases.

## Persona Description
Olivia coordinates software releases across multiple teams and environments, requiring careful configuration management during transitions. Her primary goal is to ensure smooth release deployments by controlling configuration changes during release windows.

## Key Requirements

1. **Release-Linked Configuration Bundles**
   - Packaging of related configuration changes into atomic deployment units
   - Versioning and labeling of configuration bundles tied to releases
   - Validation of configuration bundles against application compatibility
   - This feature is critical for Olivia to ensure that all interdependent configuration changes are deployed together, maintaining system consistency during complex releases involving multiple components

2. **Configuration Freeze Periods**
   - Time-based restrictions on configuration changes
   - Emergency override workflows with approval process
   - Audit logging of freeze exceptions
   - This feature allows Olivia to stabilize configurations during critical periods like release windows, reducing the risk of unexpected changes disrupting planned deployments

3. **Progressive Configuration Rollout**
   - Phased deployment of configuration changes across environments
   - Automatic monitoring of system health during rollouts
   - Rollback triggers based on defined health metrics
   - This feature enables Olivia to safely introduce configuration changes by gradually expanding their scope while automatically reverting problematic changes before they affect the entire system

4. **Feature Flag Integration**
   - Configuration-based feature activation rules
   - Coordination between code deployments and feature enablement
   - Percentage-based and cohort-based feature activation
   - This feature gives Olivia fine-grained control over feature availability, allowing code to be deployed separately from feature activation and enabling controlled feature introduction

5. **Inter-Team Configuration Dependency Mapping**
   - Visualization of dependencies between team configurations
   - Impact analysis for configuration changes across team boundaries
   - Coordination tools for cross-team configuration changes
   - This feature helps Olivia understand how configuration changes in one team's domain might affect other teams, ensuring proper sequencing and coordination of changes during complex releases

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Automated testing of configuration bundle consistency
- Simulation framework for progressive rollout scenarios
- Test fixtures for feature flag validation
- Mocking of monitoring metrics for rollback testing
- Visualization testing for dependency mapping

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration bundle validation in under 3 seconds
- Support for managing thousands of interdependent configuration parameters
- Rollout state calculation in near real-time (< 1 second)
- Dependency impact analysis in under 5 seconds for complex systems

### Integration Points
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment systems
- Release management and planning tools
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Feature flag management systems
- Team collaboration and ticketing platforms
- Version control systems

### Key Constraints
- Zero downtime for configuration deployments
- Guaranteed consistency between related configuration items
- Complete audit trail for all configuration changes
- Support for heterogeneous application stacks
- Release and deployment process agnostic

## Core Functionality

The library should provide:

1. **Configuration Bundle Management**
   - Bundle definition and composition
   - Validation against application compatibility rules
   - Atomic deployment mechanisms
   - Rollback capability for bundles

2. **Freeze Period Control**
   - Freeze period scheduling and enforcement
   - Emergency change request workflow
   - Approval routing and tracking
   - Compliance reporting for freeze periods

3. **Progressive Rollout Engine**
   - Rollout strategy definition
   - Phased deployment orchestration
   - Health metric monitoring integration
   - Automatic and manual rollback triggers

4. **Feature Flag Framework**
   - Flag definition and dependency mapping
   - Activation rule configuration
   - Progressive enablement strategies
   - Flag state monitoring and reporting

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Configuration dependency modeling
   - Cross-team impact analysis
   - Change coordination tools
   - Dependency visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Configuration bundle consistency and atomicity
- Freeze period enforcement with override capabilities
- Progressive rollout behavior including automatic rollbacks
- Feature flag activation rules and coordination
- Cross-team dependency identification and impact analysis

### Critical User Scenarios
- Coordinating configuration changes across multiple teams for a major release
- Enforcing configuration freezes during critical business periods
- Progressively rolling out configuration changes with automatic safety rollbacks
- Coordinating feature flag states with application deployments
- Managing complex dependencies between team configurations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Configuration bundle validation in under 3 seconds
- Freeze state determination in under 100ms
- Rollout state calculation in under 1 second
- Dependency graph traversal in under 5 seconds for complex systems
- Support for thousands of concurrent feature flags

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of partially deployed configuration bundles
- Resolution of conflicting freeze periods and emergency changes
- Recovery from failed rollouts and automatic rollbacks
- Behavior during monitoring system unavailability
- Resolution of circular dependencies between configurations

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% unit test coverage for all release-critical functionality
- Integration tests for all external system integration points
- Chaos testing for partial failure scenarios
- Performance testing for all time-sensitive operations
- Regression tests for all previously encountered release issues

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Configuration-related release failures are reduced by at least 80%
2. All interdependent configuration changes are consistently deployed together
3. Configuration freezes effectively prevent unauthorized changes during critical periods
4. Progressive rollouts automatically detect and remediate problematic configuration changes
5. Feature flag states are reliably coordinated with application deployments
6. Teams have clear visibility into how their configuration changes might impact other teams
7. Release coordination overhead is significantly reduced

## Setup and Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv init --lib` to create a library project structure and set up the virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run specific tests with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Format code with `uv run ruff format`
6. Lint code with `uv run ruff check .`
7. Check types with `uv run pyright`

To use the library in your application:
1. Install the package with `uv pip install -e .` in development or specify it as a dependency in your project
2. Import the library modules in your code to leverage the release-oriented configuration management functionality
