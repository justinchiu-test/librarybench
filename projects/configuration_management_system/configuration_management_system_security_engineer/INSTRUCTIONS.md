# Secure Configuration Management Framework

## Overview
A security-focused configuration management system that prioritizes regulatory compliance, sensitive data protection, and comprehensive audit capabilities. The system enforces security policies across all configuration settings and provides detailed tracking of configuration changes with security impact annotations.

## Persona Description
Marcus works on a security team responsible for ensuring that all configurations across the organization adhere to regulatory and internal security standards. His primary goal is to audit configuration changes for security implications and enforce encryption of sensitive values.

## Key Requirements

1. **Compliance Rule Engine that Validates Configurations Against Security Policies**
   - Implement a rule engine that evaluates configurations against customizable security policies
   - Support complex policy rules with dependencies and conditional logic
   - Critical for Marcus to ensure all system configurations comply with regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and internal security standards

2. **Sensitive Value Encryption with Key Rotation Management**
   - Develop encryption capabilities for storing and retrieving sensitive configuration values
   - Include key rotation mechanisms to maintain cryptographic security over time
   - Essential for Marcus to protect credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data from unauthorized access while enabling secure operational use

3. **Configuration Change Audit Trails with Security Impact Annotations**
   - Create comprehensive audit logging for all configuration changes
   - Add security impact analysis capabilities that annotate changes with risk assessments
   - Vital for Marcus to track who made what changes, when, and what security implications those changes might have

4. **Attribute-based Access Control for Security-sensitive Configuration Sections**
   - Implement fine-grained access controls based on configuration attributes and user roles
   - Support security-specific permissions that limit access to sensitive configuration sections
   - Necessary for Marcus to enforce the principle of least privilege across all configuration operations

5. **Security Scanning Integration that Tests Configurations Against Vulnerability Databases**
   - Build an API for integrating with security scanning tools and vulnerability databases
   - Provide mechanisms to check configurations for known security vulnerabilities
   - Crucial for Marcus to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses in configurations

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All security validation rules must have comprehensive test coverage with both positive and negative test cases
- Encryption mechanisms must be tested against known cryptographic standards
- Access control mechanisms must have thorough testing for permission boundaries and edge cases
- Audit functionality must verify complete capture of all configuration operations
- Vulnerability scanning integration must be tested with mock security databases

### Performance Expectations
- Encryption/decryption operations must complete within 100ms
- Policy validation should evaluate 1000+ rules in under 1 second
- Audit logging must not impact system performance by more than 5%
- Access control decisions must be made within 50ms
- Security scans must process configurations at a rate of at least 10MB/second

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with SIEM systems for audit log forwarding
- Support for external key management services (KMS) and hardware security modules (HSM)
- Interfaces for connecting to vulnerability databases and security scanning tools
- Integration with identity providers for authentication and authorization
- API endpoints for security reporting and compliance verification

### Key Constraints
- All cryptographic operations must use approved algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- Data at rest and in transit must always be encrypted
- The system must be usable in air-gapped environments
- No security-critical operations should be performed client-side
- Must maintain an immutable audit trail that cannot be tampered with

## Core Functionality

The Secure Configuration Management Framework should implement:

1. A policy engine that:
   - Defines security policies using a declarative language
   - Validates configurations against these policies
   - Supports complex rule dependencies and conditions
   - Provides clear explanations for policy violations

2. An encryption system that:
   - Securely stores sensitive configuration values
   - Manages encryption keys with rotation capabilities
   - Provides transparent access to authorized users
   - Logs all encryption/decryption operations

3. A comprehensive audit system that:
   - Records all configuration operations with complete metadata
   - Analyzes changes for security impact
   - Supports non-repudiation through cryptographic signatures
   - Provides advanced query capabilities for investigations

4. An attribute-based access control system that:
   - Enforces granular permissions based on user attributes and configuration properties
   - Implements security-specific roles and permissions
   - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive configurations
   - Logs all access attempts, including denied ones

5. A security scanning framework that:
   - Checks configurations against known vulnerability patterns
   - Integrates with external security databases
   - Provides risk scoring for potential vulnerabilities
   - Suggests remediation steps for identified issues

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Security policies correctly validate configurations and reject non-compliant settings
- Encryption properly protects sensitive values and supports key rotation
- Audit system captures all configuration changes with accurate metadata
- Access controls correctly enforce permissions based on user attributes and configuration sensitivity
- Security scanning correctly identifies vulnerable configurations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Security policy violations are detected and reported with clear explanations
- Encrypted values are securely stored and can only be accessed by authorized users
- All configuration changes are comprehensively logged with security impact annotations
- Users can only access configuration sections appropriate to their role and permissions
- Vulnerability scans detect known security issues in configurations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Policy validation performance remains consistent with increasing rule complexity
- Encryption operations scale linearly with the number of sensitive values
- Audit logging does not significantly impact system performance under load
- Access control decisions remain fast regardless of permission complexity
- Security scanning completes full configuration audits within acceptable timeframes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- System handles attempted security bypasses and escalation attempts gracefully
- Encryption system remains secure even if database is compromised
- Audit system preserves logs even during system failures
- Access control maintains security during partial system outages
- Security scanning correctly handles malformed or deceptive configurations

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Security-critical code paths must have 100% test coverage
- Cryptographic functions must be verified against standard test vectors
- Access control edge cases must be explicitly tested
- Audit functionality must verify capture of all operation types
- Integration points with security systems must have comprehensive tests

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All configurations adhere to defined security policies with zero compliance violations
2. Sensitive configuration values are properly encrypted with no unauthorized access possible
3. Configuration audit trails provide complete visibility into all changes with security annotations
4. Access controls properly enforce the principle of least privilege with no permission escalation possible
5. Security scanning successfully identifies potential vulnerabilities in configurations
6. The system meets all regulatory requirements for configuration security
7. All security operations are properly logged and available for forensic analysis
8. The system can be integrated into existing security workflows and toolchains
