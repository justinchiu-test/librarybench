# Secure Configuration Management System

## Overview
A security-focused configuration management library designed for organizations that need to enforce regulatory compliance, protect sensitive configuration values, and maintain comprehensive audit trails. This system enables security teams to define and enforce security policies, encrypt sensitive data, and track configuration changes with security impact annotations.

## Persona Description
Marcus works on a security team responsible for ensuring that all configurations across the organization adhere to regulatory and internal security standards. His primary goal is to audit configuration changes for security implications and enforce encryption of sensitive values.

## Key Requirements

1. **Compliance Rule Engine**
   - Ability to define and enforce security policies as rules against configurations
   - Support for common compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.)
   - Validation of configurations against security best practices
   - This feature is critical for Marcus to automate compliance checks across thousands of configuration parameters and ensure adherence to security standards

2. **Sensitive Value Encryption**
   - Transparent encryption/decryption of sensitive configuration values
   - Key management system with rotation capabilities
   - Granular control over encryption algorithms and key strength
   - This feature allows Marcus to ensure that credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data are never stored in plaintext while remaining usable by authorized systems

3. **Configuration Change Audit Trails**
   - Comprehensive logging of all configuration changes
   - Security impact annotations for changes to sensitive parameters
   - Tamper-proof audit records with cryptographic verification
   - This feature provides Marcus with the ability to investigate security incidents, prove compliance during audits, and understand the security implications of configuration changes

4. **Attribute-Based Access Control**
   - Fine-grained permissions for accessing and modifying security-sensitive configurations
   - Support for complex access policies based on user attributes and config metadata
   - Integration with organization identity management systems
   - This feature ensures that only authorized personnel can access or modify security-critical configurations, reducing the risk of insider threats

5. **Security Scanning Integration**
   - API for integrating with vulnerability scanners and security tools
   - Configuration testing against known vulnerability databases
   - Automated remediation recommendations for vulnerable configurations
   - This feature helps Marcus proactively identify and address security weaknesses in configuration before they can be exploited

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Comprehensive test suite for all encryption and security-related functionality
- Mocked security scanning interfaces for testing integration points
- Test fixtures representing various compliance frameworks
- Property-based testing for security rule validation
- Tests for key rotation and management processes

### Performance Expectations
- Minimal overhead for encryption/decryption operations (< 10ms per operation)
- Support for high-throughput audit logging (1000+ events per second)
- Rule engine evaluation in under 100ms for complete configuration sets
- Efficient storage and retrieval of large audit histories

### Integration Points
- Identity and access management systems (LDAP, OAuth, SAML)
- Hardware security modules (HSM) or key management services (KMS)
- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Vulnerability scanning and security testing tools
- Compliance reporting and dashboard systems

### Key Constraints
- Encryption operations must be FIPS 140-2 compliant where required
- All security functions must have fallback mechanisms for degraded operation
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations
- Audit logs must be immutable and tamper-evident
- No security through obscurity - all security mechanisms must be open to review

## Core Functionality

The library should provide:

1. **Security Policy Definition and Enforcement**
   - Domain-specific language for defining security policies
   - Rule evaluation engine for checking configurations against policies
   - Reporting on compliance status and violations

2. **Encryption Management**
   - Transparent encryption layer for sensitive configuration values
   - Key management, including generation, storage, rotation, and revocation
   - Support for multiple encryption algorithms and strategies

3. **Audit and Compliance Tracking**
   - Immutable audit trail of all configuration operations
   - Security impact classification for configuration changes
   - Historical compliance status tracking

4. **Access Control System**
   - Attribute-based access control for configuration operations
   - Integration with external authentication and authorization systems
   - Permission model for fine-grained access to configuration sections

5. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Configuration analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Integration with external security scanning tools
   - Remediation tracking and management

6. **Security Event Monitoring**
   - Real-time alerting for security-critical configuration changes
   - Anomaly detection for unusual configuration modifications
   - Integration with incident response workflows

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Encryption and decryption of sensitive values
- Policy rule evaluation and enforcement
- Audit logging accuracy and completeness
- Access control effectiveness
- Vulnerability detection capability

### Critical User Scenarios
- Defining and enforcing organization-wide security policies
- Managing encryption of sensitive configuration values
- Investigating configuration changes during security incidents
- Controlling access to security-critical configurations
- Scanning configurations for security vulnerabilities

### Performance Benchmarks
- Encryption/decryption operations under 10ms
- Policy evaluation under 100ms for complete configuration set
- Audit logging capable of handling peak loads (1000+ events/second)
- Response time impact on configuration retrieval under 5%

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Behavior during key compromise and emergency rotation
- Recovery from corrupted encryption metadata
- Handling of partial policy evaluation failures
- Response to attempted tampering with audit logs
- Graceful degradation when security services are unavailable

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of all security-critical functions
- Penetration testing for encryption implementation
- Compliance validation against relevant security standards
- Fuzz testing for policy evaluation engine
- Stress testing for audit subsystem under high load

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All sensitive configuration values are properly encrypted at rest and in transit
2. Security policies are consistently enforced across all configuration changes
3. Complete and tamper-evident audit trails are maintained for all configuration operations
4. Access controls prevent unauthorized access to security-sensitive configurations
5. Integration with security scanning tools identifies and helps remediate vulnerable configurations
6. All security functions continue to operate correctly during key rotation and other maintenance operations

## Setup and Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv init --lib` to create a library project structure and set up the virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run specific tests with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Format code with `uv run ruff format`
6. Lint code with `uv run ruff check .`
7. Check types with `uv run pyright`

To use the library in your application:
