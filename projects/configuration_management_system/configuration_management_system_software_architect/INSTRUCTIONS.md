# Service-Oriented Configuration Architecture System

## Overview
A configuration management library designed for complex distributed systems and microservices architectures. This system enables software architects to maintain configuration consistency across service boundaries while supporting controlled service-specific customizations through inheritance models, schema versioning, and architectural boundary enforcement.

## Persona Description
Elena designs complex distributed systems that need to maintain configuration consistency across microservices while allowing for service-specific customizations. Her primary goal is to create configuration hierarchies that ensure architectural integrity while enabling rapid service evolution.

## Key Requirements

1. **Service Dependency Modeling with Inheritance Visualization**
   - Ability to define and visualize service configuration relationships and inheritance paths
   - Support for modeling dependencies between service configurations
   - Tools to visualize configuration inheritance and override patterns
   - This feature is critical for Elena to understand how configuration changes propagate across complex service architectures and to maintain a coherent mental model of the system configuration

2. **Schema Versioning with Compatibility Verification**
   - Support for versioned configuration schemas
   - Automated backward compatibility checking for schema changes
   - Migration paths for evolving configuration schemas
   - This feature allows Elena to evolve service configurations over time without breaking existing services, ensuring that configuration changes respect semantic versioning principles

3. **Architectural Boundary Enforcement**
   - Configuration namespaces mapped to architectural boundaries
   - Rules engine for enforcing cross-service configuration consistency
   - Domain-based isolation of configuration concerns
   - This feature helps Elena maintain clear architectural boundaries by preventing inappropriate sharing or access to configuration across service boundaries

4. **API-First Configuration Management**
   - RESTful API for configuration management operations
   - Service discovery integration for configuration distribution
   - Client libraries for different programming languages
   - This feature enables programmatic management of configurations across Elena's distributed services, facilitating automation and integration

5. **Configuration-as-Code Workflows**
   - Git-based management of configuration definitions
   - Architectural review pipelines for configuration changes
   - Pull request workflows for configuration modifications
   - This feature allows Elena to apply software engineering best practices to configuration management, treating configurations with the same rigor as application code

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Isolated testing of configuration resolution logic
- Mocking framework for service discovery components
- Property-based testing for schema compatibility rules
- Integration tests for cross-service configuration scenarios
- Graph-based testing for dependency and inheritance models

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration resolution time under 10ms (local cache)
- Support for managing thousands of services and millions of configuration parameters
- Efficient schema validation (< 50ms for complex schemas)
- Support for high-throughput configuration changes during deployments

### Integration Points
- Service discovery mechanisms (Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, etc.)
- CI/CD systems for configuration review and deployment
- Version control systems (Git) for configuration-as-code
- API gateways for configuration management API
- Event buses for configuration change notifications

### Key Constraints
- Support for polyglot service environments
- Configuration access patterns must support high fan-out scenarios
- Backward compatibility guarantees for configuration consumers
- Minimal dependencies to facilitate embedding in various languages
- No runtime dependencies on external services for core configuration resolution

## Core Functionality

The library should provide:

1. **Hierarchical Configuration Model**
   - Multi-level inheritance model mapped to service architecture
   - Override mechanics with source tracking
   - Conflict resolution strategies for competing configuration sources

2. **Schema Definition and Evolution**
   - Schema definition language for configuration structures
   - Versioning system for schemas with semantic version tracking
   - Compatibility checking between schema versions

3. **Boundary Management**
   - Namespace isolation based on architectural boundaries
   - Cross-boundary access control
   - Shared configuration domains with controlled visibility

4. **API and Service Integration**
   - Configuration management API with CRUD operations
   - Service discovery integration for configuration distribution
   - Change notification system for reactive configuration updates

5. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - Dependency graph visualization
   - Configuration tree rendering
   - Impact analysis for proposed changes

6. **Configuration-as-Code Pipeline**
   - Git integration for configuration source management
   - Review workflow integration
   - Deployment pipeline for configuration changes

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Configuration inheritance and override behavior
- Schema versioning and compatibility checking
- Namespace isolation and boundary enforcement
- API operations for configuration management
- Configuration change propagation

### Critical User Scenarios
- Defining service configuration hierarchies
- Evolving configuration schemas with backward compatibility
- Enforcing architectural boundaries in configuration access
- Managing configurations via API across services
- Implementing configuration-as-code workflows

### Performance Benchmarks
- Configuration resolution under 10ms from local cache
- Schema validation under 50ms for complex schemas
- Support for 1000+ services with unique configurations
- Configuration API throughput of 100+ requests per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Circular dependencies in configuration inheritance
- Schema incompatibilities between service versions
- Partial failure of configuration distribution
- Concurrency conflicts in configuration updates
- Recovery from invalid configuration states

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core resolution logic
- 100% coverage for schema compatibility checking
- Integration tests for all supported service discovery mechanisms
- Performance tests for all critical operations
- Graph-theoretical testing of inheritance and dependency models

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Service teams can independently manage their configurations while maintaining architectural consistency
2. Configuration schemas can evolve without breaking existing services
3. Architectural boundaries are effectively enforced through configuration namespaces
4. Configuration can be managed programmatically via API with service discovery integration
5. Configuration changes follow software engineering best practices with proper review and deployment
6. The system supports visualization of complex configuration relationships to aid architectural understanding
