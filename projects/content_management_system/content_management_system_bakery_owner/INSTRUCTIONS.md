# Artisanal Bakery Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system tailored for small bakery businesses that enables easy menu updates, promotion scheduling, and customer engagement through a streamlined API-driven backend. This system focuses on food presentation, seasonal content management, and mobile-friendly image handling without requiring technical expertise.

## Persona Description
Sophia runs a small family bakery and wants to showcase her products and share seasonal specialties with customers. Her primary goal is to easily update her menu and special offers without technical assistance while maintaining a visually appealing site that reflects her brand's warm, artisanal aesthetic.

## Key Requirements

1. **Menu Builder with Food-Specific Templates**
   - Create a menu management system with specialized food item templates
   - Critical for Sophia because it allows her to showcase bakery items with appropriate attributes (ingredients, allergens, prices) in a consistent format without needing to understand HTML or design principles

2. **Time-based Content Scheduling**
   - Implement a scheduling system for seasonal offerings and limited-time promotions
   - Essential for Sophia's bakery business which relies on holiday specials, seasonal ingredients, and limited-time offers that need to appear and disappear automatically

3. **Customer Review Management**
   - Develop a review collection, display and moderation system
   - Important for building customer trust and engagement while giving Sophia control over which feedback appears on her site, helping to maintain her brand reputation

4. **Mobile-optimized Image Management**
   - Create an image processing system with automatic enhancement for food photography
   - Crucial for Sophia who takes quick photos of her baked goods on her smartphone and needs them to look professional without manual editing or optimization

5. **Order Form Builder**
   - Implement a customizable form creation system for special orders and requests
   - Necessary for Sophia to collect detailed information for custom cake orders, catering requests, and other specialized products that require specific customer inputs

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All content management functions must be accessible via a well-documented API
- Each feature should be independently testable with clear input/output expectations
- Mock adapters should be available for external dependencies (image processing, etc.)
- Content scheduling should support time manipulation for testing temporal features

### Performance Expectations
- Menu and product image gallery must support at least 200 items with < 200ms retrieval time
- Image processing operations should complete within 3 seconds per image
- System should handle at least 50 concurrent users (small local business scale)
- Content scheduling checks should run with minimal overhead (< 50ms)

### Integration Points
- Image processing pipeline for automatic enhancement of uploaded photos
- JSON-based API for all content operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Webhook support for integrating with external notification systems
- Export capabilities for menu data in standard formats (JSON, CSV)

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implemented without UI components
- Storage layer must support both file system and database backends
- Authentication and authorization must be separated from content management
- System must function with minimal dependencies beyond Python standard library

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Artisanal Bakery CMS includes:

1. **Content Type Management**
   - Define and manage specialized content types for bakery items with appropriate fields
   - Support for different menu categories and sections
   - Custom field types for prices, ingredients, allergens, and availability

2. **Media Management**
   - Process and optimize images specifically for food presentation
   - Automatic enhancement of bakery product photos
   - Storage and categorization of media assets
   - Retrieval API with filtering and sorting capabilities

3. **Scheduling and Time-based Publishing**
   - Define content visibility based on date ranges
   - Schedule future content publication and expiration
   - Seasonal/holiday promotion automation
   - Recurring schedule support for weekly specials

4. **Customer Interaction**
   - Review collection and storage architecture
   - Moderation workflow and approval process
   - Rating aggregation and statistics
   - Custom order form creation and submission handling

5. **Data Access Layer**
   - Clear API design for content CRUD operations
   - Query capabilities for content retrieval with filtering
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - Content versioning and history tracking

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Content creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations
- Image processing and optimization pipeline
- Scheduling and time-based content visibility
- Review submission and moderation workflow
- Custom form field validation and submission handling

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a new seasonal menu item with custom attributes
- Scheduling a promotion to automatically start and end on specific dates
- Processing and enhancing a batch of bakery product images
- Moderating customer reviews based on content policies
- Creating a custom order form with specialized fields for cake decoration

### Performance Benchmarks
- Menu retrieval time under varied load conditions
- Image processing throughput and optimization ratio
- Concurrent content operation handling
- Scheduling system overhead under load
- Database query performance with growing content volume

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed content submissions
- Managing conflicting scheduled content
- Recovering from failed image processing operations
- Handling very large or invalid image uploads
- Managing duplicate content submissions
- Handling time zone edge cases in scheduling

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of API endpoints
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must verify all benchmark requirements
- Security tests for access control and input validation

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. A bakery owner can define and publish menu items with specialized attributes through the API
2. Seasonal content automatically appears and disappears based on scheduled dates
3. Customer reviews can be submitted, moderated, and displayed with a simple API call
4. Food images are automatically enhanced and optimized upon upload
5. Custom order forms can be created with bakery-specific field types and validation
6. All operations can be performed via API without any UI components
7. The system handles the expected performance requirements under load
8. All tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works as expected
