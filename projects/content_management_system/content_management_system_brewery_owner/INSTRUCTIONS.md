# Craft Brewery Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system for craft breweries that enables beer catalog management, tap room status updates, release promotions, brewing documentation, and age verification. This system focuses on showcasing beer offerings and brewery story while building brand loyalty through engaging content.

## Persona Description
Carlos needs to showcase his brewery's story, current tap offerings, and upcoming events to beer enthusiasts. His primary goal is to frequently update beer descriptions and availability while building brand loyalty through an engaging content experience that reflects his brewery's unique personality.

## Key Requirements

1. **Product Catalog with Customizable Beer Attributes**
   - Implement a beer catalog management system with specialized characteristics tracking
   - Critical for Carlos because it allows him to showcase the unique attributes of his craft beers (ABV, IBU, hops, malt, flavor profile, etc.) in a consistent format that helps customers discover beers matching their preferences

2. **Tap Room Status Board with Real-time Availability Updates**
   - Create a tap management system for tracking current offerings and keg levels
   - Essential for Carlos to provide up-to-date information about which beers are currently pouring, helping customers plan visits and reducing staff time spent answering availability questions

3. **Beer Release Countdown Timers with Notification Signup**
   - Develop a release promotion system with time-based content and alerts
   - Important for building anticipation around new beer releases, limited editions, and special batches, helping Carlos create excitement and ensure customers don't miss releases they're interested in

4. **Recipe and Brewing Process Documentation Templates**
   - Implement a structured content system for sharing brewing information
   - Necessary for Carlos to share the story behind his beers, showcasing the craftsmanship and unique brewing approaches that differentiate his brewery while engaging beer enthusiasts interested in the technical aspects

5. **Age Verification System with Regional Compliance Settings**
   - Create a configurable age verification system with geographical rule variations
   - Crucial for ensuring legal compliance with alcohol marketing regulations across different jurisdictions while providing appropriate access to brewery content

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Beer catalog entries must be testable with various attribute combinations
- Tap status system must support simulated updates and availability changes
- Release countdown functionality must be testable with time manipulation
- Recipe documentation must verify structure and content requirements
- Age verification must be testable with various regional settings and scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Beer catalog must support at least 500 different brews with < 200ms retrieval time
- Tap status updates should register and display within 5 seconds
- Countdown timers should be accurate to within 1 second
- Recipe document generation should complete in < 3 seconds
- Age verification checks should add minimal overhead (< 100ms) to content access

### Integration Points
- Inventory management system for tap availability tracking
- Email/SMS service for release notifications
- Calendar system for event and release scheduling
- Document generation for printable beer information
- GeoIP or similar service for regional compliance determination

### Key Constraints
- No UI components, only API endpoints and business logic
- Content must be structured for multi-channel distribution
- Regulatory compliance with alcohol marketing laws
- Support for frequent content updates by brewing staff
- Scalability for growing product catalog and customer base

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Craft Brewery CMS includes:

1. **Beer Catalog Management**
   - Beer definition with customizable attributes
   - Category and style organization
   - Seasonal and limited edition designation
   - Search and filtering capabilities

2. **Tap Room Management**
   - Current tap list configuration
   - Keg level tracking and availability updates
   - Rotation scheduling and upcoming taps
   - Happy hour and special pricing integration

3. **Release Promotion System**
   - Release scheduling and countdown management
   - Notification list management and triggering
   - Pre-release content scheduling
   - Release event coordination

4. **Brewing Documentation**
   - Recipe template definition and instantiation
   - Process documentation with structured sections
   - Ingredient and technique tagging
   - Brewing history and beer lineage tracking

5. **Age Compliance System**
   - Age verification rule configuration
   - Geographic region detection and rule application
   - Verification session management
   - Access control based on verification status

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Beer catalog entry creation and attribute management
- Tap status updating and availability tracking
- Release countdown functionality and notification system
- Recipe and brewing process documentation creation
- Age verification rule application and session management

### Critical User Scenarios
- Adding a new seasonal beer with complete attribute set
- Updating tap status when kegs are changed or emptied
- Setting up a new beer release with countdown and notifications
- Creating a detailed brewing process document for a signature beer
- Configuring and testing age verification for different regions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Beer catalog search and filtering response times
- Tap status update propagation speed
- Concurrent countdown timer accuracy for multiple releases
- Document generation speed for various recipe complexities
- Age verification overhead under varied traffic conditions

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling discontinued beers while preserving historical information
- Managing tap changeovers during business hours
- Handling time zone issues for release countdowns
- Recovering from interrupted document generation
- Gracefully managing verification failures and retry attempts

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of age verification code paths
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must verify all benchmark requirements
- Security tests for age verification bypass attempts

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Beer catalog can manage diverse products with detailed attributes
2. Tap room status can be updated and tracked in near real-time
3. Beer releases can be promoted with accurate countdowns and notifications
4. Brewing processes can be documented with consistent structured formats
5. Age verification works correctly according to regional requirements
6. All operations can be performed via API without any UI components
7. The system handles the expected performance requirements under load
8. Content updates can be performed quickly and efficiently
9. All tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works as expected
