# Conference Event Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system for technology conference organization that enables speaker profile management, dynamic agenda building, live session updates, phase-based content transitions, and post-event resource archiving. This system focuses on managing the complete event content lifecycle from promotion to archive.

## Persona Description
Sam organizes annual technology conferences and needs to build excitement before the event and provide resources during and after. His primary goal is to showcase speakers and sessions while providing a content platform that transitions through pre-event, live event, and post-event phases with different information priorities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Speaker Profile System with Talk Proposal Workflow**
   - Implement a comprehensive speaker management system with submission and selection process
   - Critical for Sam because it streamlines the collection and evaluation of presentation proposals while creating compelling speaker profiles that help market the conference and attract attendees

2. **Dynamic Agenda Builder with Personal Schedule Creation**
   - Create a flexible schedule management system with personalization capabilities
   - Essential for organizing complex multi-track conference programs while allowing attendees to plan their own experience by selecting sessions of interest

3. **Live Session Status Updates with Room Change Notifications**
   - Develop a real-time session management system with change alerts
   - Important for communicating last-minute adjustments during the event, such as schedule changes, room relocations, or cancellations, ensuring attendees have current information

4. **Content Phase Transitions Triggered by Event Timeline**
   - Implement an event phase management system with automated content transformation
   - Necessary for smoothly transitioning the content focus from pre-event marketing to live event logistics to post-event resources without manual reworking of the entire site

5. **Post-conference Resource Library with Presentation Archives**
   - Create a comprehensive archiving system for conference materials
   - Crucial for extending the value of the event beyond its timeline by providing organized access to presentations, videos, and other resources after the conference concludes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Speaker workflow must be testable throughout the submission and selection process
- Agenda building must verify schedule integrity with conflict detection
- Status update system must be testable with simulated live event scenarios
- Phase transition must be verifiable with timeline-triggered content changes
- Resource archiving must validate organization and accessibility of materials

### Performance Expectations
- Speaker profile system should handle 500+ submissions efficiently
- Agenda builder should support conferences with 200+ sessions across 10+ tracks
- Live updates should propagate to all endpoints within 30 seconds
- Phase transitions should execute completely within 5 minutes
- Resource library should handle 10GB+ of presentation materials with efficient search

### Integration Points
- Form system for speaker submissions
- Calendar systems for schedule management
- Notification services for real-time alerts
- Content transformation pipeline for phase transitions
- Media storage for presentation materials and recordings

### Key Constraints
- No UI components, only API endpoints and business logic
- Support for high-traffic periods during the live event
- Data consistency across all phases of the event
- Efficient handling of large media files
- Clear separation of public and administrative functions

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Conference Event CMS includes:

1. **Speaker Management**
   - Speaker profile creation and maintenance
   - Proposal submission and review workflow
   - Selection and confirmation process
   - Speaker information display and promotion

2. **Schedule Management**
   - Session definition with metadata and categorization
   - Time slot and room assignment
   - Track organization and conflict detection
   - Personal agenda creation and synchronization

3. **Live Event Operations**
   - Real-time status monitoring and updates
   - Change notification and distribution
   - Session feedback and rating collection
   - Attendance tracking and capacity management

4. **Phase-based Content Management**
   - Event phase definition and rules
   - Content transformation for different phases
   - Automated transition triggering
   - Phase-specific functionality activation

5. **Resource Archiving**
   - Presentation collection and processing
   - Media organization and metadata enrichment
   - Search and discovery optimization
   - Long-term preservation strategies

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Speaker proposal submission and selection process
- Schedule creation with conflict detection and resolution
- Live update creation and notification distribution
- Phase-based content transformation and timing
- Resource collection and archive organization

### Critical User Scenarios
- Processing a speaker from submission through acceptance to presentation
- Building a complete conference schedule with multiple tracks
- Managing real-time changes during the event
- Transitioning content through all event phases
- Creating a comprehensive post-event resource library

### Performance Benchmarks
- Speaker system performance with high submission volume
- Schedule builder response time with complex agenda scenarios
- Update propagation time during peak event usage
- Phase transition completion time with full content set
- Archive search performance with complete presentation collection

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling incomplete speaker submissions or withdrawals
- Managing schedule conflicts and last-minute changes
- Recovering from failed updates during critical event periods
- Addressing phase transition failures or timing issues
- Managing large or problematic presentation files

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of critical event-day operations
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must verify all benchmark requirements
- Stress tests for peak event traffic scenarios

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Speaker proposals can be collected, reviewed, and selected efficiently
2. Conference schedules can be created and personalized without conflicts
3. Live updates can be communicated quickly during the event
4. Content transitions smoothly through all event phases
5. Conference resources are preserved and accessible after the event
6. All operations can be performed via API without any UI components
7. The system handles the expected performance requirements under peak load
8. Event data remains consistent across all phases
9. All tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works as expected
