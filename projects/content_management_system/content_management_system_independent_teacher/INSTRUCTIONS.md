# Educational Content Management System

A specialized content management system designed for independent teachers to manage course materials and student access.

## Overview

The Educational Content Management System is a comprehensive library that enables independent teachers to create and manage course content, restrict access to paid students, track progress, and generate completion certificates. It focuses on creating secure learning environments while showcasing teaching philosophy and course offerings to prospective students.

## Persona Description

Elena offers specialized education courses and needs a platform to share her curriculum, student resources, and course registration. Her primary goal is to create password-protected areas for current students while showcasing her teaching philosophy and course offerings to prospective clients.

## Key Requirements

1. **Membership and Access Control System**: Develop a robust authentication and authorization system that allows for course-specific content access based on student enrollment status. This is critical for Elena as it ensures her premium educational content is only accessible to paying students while still allowing public access to course descriptions and sample materials.

2. **Interactive Lesson Planner**: Create a structured content management system for educational materials with embedded exercise templates and interactive elements. This feature is essential as it allows Elena to create pedagogically sound lesson structures with integrated activities, making her online teaching as effective as in-person instruction.

3. **Assignment Submission and Feedback Portal**: Implement a comprehensive system for students to submit assignments and for teachers to provide structured feedback. This functionality is vital as it creates a closed feedback loop between teacher and students, enabling personalized guidance and progress tracking that is central to effective learning.

4. **Student Progress Tracking**: Develop analytics and tracking mechanisms to monitor student engagement, completion of materials, and performance on assessments. This feature is crucial for Elena to identify struggling students, measure the effectiveness of her teaching materials, and provide timely interventions when needed.

5. **Certificate Generation System**: Create an automated system for generating and awarding course completion certificates based on customizable criteria. This capability is important as it provides students with tangible recognition of their achievements, adding value to Elena's courses and helping students demonstrate their newly acquired skills.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have unit tests with at least 90% coverage
- Authentication and access control must be thoroughly tested with various permission scenarios
- Content rendering must be testable with mock data
- Assignment submission flows must be verifiable through test fixtures
- Progress tracking calculations must be validated with comprehensive test cases

### Performance Expectations
- Content delivery operations must complete within 200ms
- Student progress calculations should process within 500ms
- Assignment submission handling should complete within 300ms
- Certificate generation should take less than 1s
- The system should handle concurrent access by at least 50 students

### Integration Points
- Support for common storage backends (local filesystem, SQLite, optional cloud storage)
- PDF generation for certificates and downloadable materials
- Content import/export in standard formats (SCORM, Markdown, etc.)
- Optional email integration for notifications and feedback
- Webhook support for integration with external learning tools

### Key Constraints
- All code must be pure Python with minimal dependencies
- No JavaScript dependencies or browser-specific code
- No direct coupling to web frameworks, though adaptors can be provided
- All content must be serializable for backup/restore
- Educational content must be versionable and support rollback

## Core Functionality

The library must provide the following core components:

1. **User and Membership Management**:
   - Student registration and profile management
   - Course enrollment and access control
   - Payment status tracking (for integration with payment systems)
   - Role-based permissions (student, teaching assistant, teacher)
   - Student grouping and cohort management

2. **Course and Lesson Management**:
   - Hierarchical curriculum structure (courses, modules, lessons)
   - Content versioning and publishing control
   - Resource attachment and organization
   - Interactive element definition and configuration
   - Lesson prerequisites and conditional release

3. **Assignment System**:
   - Assignment definition with instructions and requirements
   - Submission collection and organization
   - Feedback mechanism with annotation capabilities
   - Grading system with rubrics
   - Plagiarism detection utilities

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Student activity logging
   - Completion status tracking
   - Performance metrics and analytics
   - Engagement measurement
   - Progress visualization data

5. **Certificate Management**:
   - Certificate template definition
   - Achievement criteria configuration
   - Automatic and manual award mechanisms
   - Verification system with unique identifiers
   - Certificate record keeping

6. **Content Security**:
   - Content encryption capabilities
   - Access logging and monitoring
   - Download and sharing controls
   - Anti-scraping measures
   - Content watermarking

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of all content types
- Proper enforcement of access controls based on enrollment
- Correct handling of assignment submission and feedback
- Accurate tracking and reporting of student progress
- Certificate generation based on completion criteria

### Critical User Scenarios
- Enrolling students in courses with appropriate access rights
- Creating and publishing a complete course curriculum
- Submitting and grading assignments with feedback
- Tracking student progress through a complete course
- Generating certificates for course completion

### Performance Benchmarks
- Content delivery times with varying amounts of content
- System behavior with concurrent student access
- Assignment processing with various file types and sizes
- Progress calculation speed with increasing student data
- Certificate generation time with different templates

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling incomplete or corrupted assignments
- Managing enrollment changes mid-course
- Recovery from partial content creation or updates
- Behavior when progress tracking data is incomplete
- Handling certificate generation for edge case scenarios

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all core components
- 100% coverage of access control mechanisms
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests for content delivery and progress tracking
- Security tests for access control and content protection

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Course content can be organized into a hierarchical structure with proper access controls
2. Students can only access content for courses they're enrolled in
3. Assignments can be submitted, reviewed, and given feedback efficiently
4. Student progress is accurately tracked and reported
5. Certificates are generated correctly based on completion criteria
6. All operations can be performed programmatically through a well-documented API
7. The entire system can be thoroughly tested using pytest with high coverage
8. Performance meets or exceeds the specified benchmarks

## Setup and Development

To set up your development environment:

1. Create a new Python library project:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install necessary development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Run a specific test:
   ```
   uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name
   ```

5. Format code:
   ```
   uv run ruff format
   ```

6. Lint code:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   ```

7. Type check:
   ```
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to adhere to the code style guidelines in the project's CLAUDE.md file, including proper type hints, docstrings, and error handling.
