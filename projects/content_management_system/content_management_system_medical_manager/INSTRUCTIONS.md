# Healthcare Practice Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system designed for medical practices to communicate services, provider information, and health resources to patients. This system enables practice managers to maintain accurate provider information and office policies while ensuring all content meets healthcare compliance standards and accessibility requirements.

## Persona Description
David manages a family medical practice website that needs to communicate services, provider information, and health resources to patients. His primary goal is to maintain accurate provider information and office policies while ensuring all content meets healthcare compliance standards and accessibility requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Provider directory with credential verification display**
   - Critical for David to maintain up-to-date information about doctors, nurse practitioners, and other providers
   - Must showcase credentials, specializations, and board certifications with verification dates
   - Should support scheduling information and provider availability updates

2. **Secure forms for patient information requests with HIPAA compliance**
   - Essential for allowing patients to communicate with the practice while maintaining privacy
   - Must implement security measures compliant with healthcare regulations
   - Should include consent tracking and secure data handling throughout the process

3. **Accessibility checker ensuring content meets WCAG standards**
   - Important for ensuring all patients, including those with disabilities, can access information
   - Must validate content against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards
   - Should provide remediation suggestions for identified accessibility issues

4. **Multilingual content management for diverse patient populations**
   - Necessary for serving diverse community with varying language needs
   - Must maintain consistency between language versions while allowing for cultural adaptations
   - Should include workflow for professional translation and verification

5. **Structured health information templates with medical citation support**
   - Valuable for providing evidence-based health resources to patients
   - Must organize health topics according to medical taxonomies
   - Should support proper citation of medical literature and authoritative sources

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have unit tests with at least 95% code coverage
- Integration tests must verify HIPAA compliance features function correctly
- Security tests must validate protection of sensitive information
- Automated accessibility validation must be thoroughly tested

### Performance Expectations
- Provider directory searches must complete within 300ms
- Form submissions must be processed within 5 seconds including encryption
- Accessibility checks must complete within 10 seconds per page
- Content must be delivered in the correct language within 200ms of language selection

### Integration Points
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for provider information
- Secure messaging gateway for form submissions
- Professional translation services
- Medical terminology and citation databases

### Key Constraints
- All patient data must be handled according to HIPAA requirements
- Content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Medical information must be verified for accuracy and include appropriate disclaimers
- System must maintain audit logs for compliance verification

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library with the following core components:

1. **Provider Management**
   - Provider profile data model with credentials and specialties
   - Verification and expiration date tracking
   - Availability and scheduling information
   - Specialty and service categorization

2. **Secure Communication**
   - Form definition and processing
   - Data encryption and secure storage
   - Consent management and tracking
   - Audit logging and compliance reporting

3. **Accessibility Validation**
   - WCAG rule implementation and checking
   - Content structure analysis
   - Remediation suggestion engine
   - Accessibility compliance reporting

4. **Multilingual Support**
   - Content translation workflow
   - Language variant management
   - Cultural adaptation tracking
   - Language detection and selection

5. **Health Information Management**
   - Medical content templates and schemas
   - Citation and reference management
   - Medical terminology validation
   - Patient education resource organization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Provider information is accurately stored and displayed with credential verification
- Patient forms securely collect and transmit information in compliance with HIPAA
- Content is properly validated against accessibility guidelines
- Multilingual content is correctly managed and served
- Health information includes proper citations and follows structured templates

### Critical User Scenarios
- Updating provider credentials and specialties
- Processing a secure patient information request
- Validating content for accessibility compliance
- Managing multilingual versions of critical health information
- Creating structured health resources with proper citations

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must support a practice with at least 50 providers
- Form system must handle at least 500 submissions per day
- Accessibility validation must process the entire site content within 1 hour
- Multilingual system must support at least 5 language variants

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling provider credential expirations and renewals
- Managing incomplete form submissions
- Addressing critical accessibility failures
- Dealing with missing translations for time-sensitive content
- Handling conflicting medical information sources

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of HIPAA compliance features
- 100% coverage of accessibility validation rules
- 100% coverage of multilingual content management

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The provider directory correctly manages and displays healthcare provider information
2. The secure forms system safely handles patient information requests
3. The accessibility validation effectively identifies WCAG compliance issues
4. The multilingual system correctly manages content in multiple languages
5. The health information system properly structures and cites medical content

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
2. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
