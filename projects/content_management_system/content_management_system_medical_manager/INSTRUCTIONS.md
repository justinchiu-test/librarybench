# Healthcare Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system for medical practices that enables provider directory management, HIPAA-compliant form processing, accessibility compliance, multilingual content support, and structured health information publishing. This system focuses on maintaining accurate medical information while ensuring regulatory compliance and accessibility.

## Persona Description
David manages a family medical practice website that needs to communicate services, provider information, and health resources to patients. His primary goal is to maintain accurate provider information and office policies while ensuring all content meets healthcare compliance standards and accessibility requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Provider Directory with Credential Verification Display**
   - Implement a medical personnel directory with credential management and verification status
   - Critical for David because it builds patient trust by transparently displaying verified professional qualifications of each provider while simplifying the process of keeping this information accurate and up-to-date

2. **Secure Forms for Patient Information with HIPAA Compliance**
   - Create a secure form management system with healthcare regulatory compliance
   - Essential for collecting necessary patient information through the website while ensuring all data handling meets strict healthcare privacy regulations and security requirements

3. **Accessibility Checker Ensuring WCAG Standards**
   - Develop an accessibility verification system for web content
   - Important for ensuring all published content is accessible to patients with disabilities, meeting legal requirements while providing equal access to healthcare information for all potential patients

4. **Multilingual Content Management for Diverse Patients**
   - Implement a translation and localization management system
   - Necessary for serving the practice's diverse patient population, ensuring critical healthcare information is available in multiple languages to reduce barriers to care

5. **Structured Health Information Templates with Citation Support**
   - Create specialized content structures for medical information with reference management
   - Crucial for publishing accurate, evidence-based health information that patients can trust, with proper attribution to medical authorities and research

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Provider information management must be testable with credential verification scenarios
- Form security must be verifiable against HIPAA compliance requirements
- Accessibility checking must validate against WCAG success criteria
- Multilingual content must be testable for consistency across translations
- Health information templates must verify proper citation formatting

### Performance Expectations
- Provider directory searches should return results in < 200ms
- Form submissions should be securely processed within 3 seconds
- Accessibility checks should complete within 10 seconds for complex content
- Translation management should support at least 5 languages without performance degradation
- Health information retrieval should be optimized for mobile devices (low bandwidth)

### Integration Points
- Credential verification services for provider information
- Secure storage for protected health information
- Accessibility validation tools and standards
- Translation services or management systems
- Medical citation and reference databases

### Key Constraints
- No UI components, only API endpoints and business logic
- Strict adherence to healthcare privacy regulations
- Comprehensive accessibility compliance
- Support for multiple languages in all content types
- Evidence-based approach to health information

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Healthcare CMS includes:

1. **Medical Provider Management**
   - Provider profile creation and maintenance
   - Credential verification and display
   - Specialization and service association
   - Scheduling information and availability

2. **Secure Form Processing**
   - HIPAA-compliant form definition
   - Secure data handling and storage
   - Consent management and tracking
   - Encrypted submission processing

3. **Accessibility Management**
   - Content structure for accessibility
   - Automated WCAG compliance checking
   - Alternative format generation (text-to-speech, high contrast)
   - Accessibility report generation

4. **Language and Localization**
   - Content translation workflow
   - Language-specific formatting and standards
   - Translation consistency verification
   - Language preference management

5. **Medical Content Management**
   - Structured health information templates
   - Medical citation and reference management
   - Health content versioning and review
   - Patient education resource organization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Provider directory management and credential display
- Secure form creation, submission, and processing
- Content accessibility checking against WCAG standards
- Multilingual content management across supported languages
