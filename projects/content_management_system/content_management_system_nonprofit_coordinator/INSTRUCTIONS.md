### Performance Expectations
- Campaign pages should update donation goals in near real-time (< 5 second delay)
- Volunteer opportunity database should support searching 1000+ opportunities in < 200ms
- Impact data calculations should process organization-wide metrics in < 2 seconds
- Report generation should compile complex grant documents in < 30 seconds
- Newsletter content management should handle lists of 50,000+ subscribers efficiently

### Integration Points
- Payment processor integration for donation tracking
- Calendar system for volunteer opportunity scheduling
- Data collection framework for impact metrics
- Document generation for grant reports
- Email delivery service integration for newsletters

### Key Constraints
- No UI components, only API endpoints and business logic
- Support for content contribution by minimally trained staff
- Compliance with non-profit reporting standards
