# Photography Portfolio Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system designed for professional photographers to showcase their work and manage client interactions. This system enables photographers to display their portfolio in visually striking galleries while efficiently organizing thousands of images and maintaining separate client-specific private collections.

## Persona Description
Mei showcases her photography portfolio to attract clients for weddings, events, and portraits. Her primary goal is to display her work in visually striking galleries while efficiently organizing thousands of images and maintaining separate client-specific private collections.

## Key Requirements

1. **Portfolio showcase with customizable viewing experiences by category**
   - Critical for Mei to showcase different photography styles and specializations (weddings, portraits, events)
   - Must support different layout options optimized for various image orientations and aspect ratios
   - Should allow creation of curated collections with specific visual narratives or themes

2. **Client proofing portal with selection and commenting tools**
   - Essential for sharing private galleries with clients to review and select images after photoshoots
   - Must track client selections, approvals, and requests for editing
   - Should support threaded comments on specific images for detailed feedback

3. **Watermarking and image protection controls**
   - Important for preventing unauthorized use of preview images while allowing clients to view them
   - Must apply configurable watermarks based on image usage context (portfolio vs. client proofing)
   - Should include download prevention features and usage tracking

4. **Photography-specific metadata management and search**
   - Necessary for organizing and finding images within a library of thousands of photographs
   - Must preserve and utilize EXIF/IPTC metadata (camera settings, location, dates)
   - Should support custom taxonomies for professional organizing (style, shoot, client, usage rights)

5. **Automated image optimization for web performance**
   - Valuable for maintaining fast site performance despite large image libraries
   - Must generate appropriate sizes and formats for different viewing contexts
   - Should balance quality and file size based on display requirements

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must verify image processing and delivery pipelines
- Performance tests must ensure gallery loading times meet standards with large image sets
- Mock external storage systems for testing image management

### Performance Expectations
- Gallery pages must load within 2 seconds with optimal image loading strategies
- Image processing for web optimization must handle at least 100 images in under 5 minutes
- Metadata operations must complete within 500ms regardless of library size
- Search queries must return results within 1 second across libraries of 10,000+ images

### Integration Points
- Image storage systems (local or cloud-based)
- RAW processing integration for professional workflows
- Email notifications for client activity
- Export capabilities for print ordering services

### Key Constraints
- Image storage must be efficient and scalable for professional volumes
- Watermarking must not degrade original image quality
- All client data must be securely isolated between clients
- System must preserve full image quality for original files

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library with the following core components:

1. **Portfolio Management**
   - Gallery and collection data models
   - Image categorization and organization
   - Showcase configuration and layout management
   - Featured content and highlight selection

2. **Client Interaction System**
   - Client account and access management
   - Private gallery creation and sharing
   - Selection tracking and approval workflows
   - Client communication and notification system

3. **Image Protection**
   - Watermarking engine with configurable options
   - Access control and permission management
   - Download prevention mechanisms
   - Usage tracking and monitoring

4. **Metadata Management**
   - EXIF/IPTC metadata extraction and indexing
   - Custom taxonomy and tagging system
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Batch metadata operations

5. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Automatic size variant generation
   - Format optimization and conversion
   - Quality-size balancing algorithms
   - Responsive image preparation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Galleries correctly display images with appropriate layouts for different categories
- Client proofing system accurately tracks selections and comments
- Watermarking applies correctly under different access contexts
- Metadata search returns accurate results based on various criteria
- Image optimization generates appropriate assets for web delivery

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a new portfolio collection with curated images and specific layout
- Setting up a client proofing gallery with access controls
- Processing a batch of new images with metadata extraction and categorization
- Handling client selections and export for final delivery
- Performing complex searches across a large image library

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must handle libraries of at least 50,000 images
- Portfolio galleries must load first meaningful content within 1.5 seconds
- Image optimization pipeline must process at least 1 image per second
- Metadata operations must scale linearly with library size

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling corrupt or incomplete image files
- Managing duplicate images with different metadata
- Recovering from interrupted batch processing
- Resolving conflicting client selections
- Dealing with extremely large original files

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of watermarking and protection features
- 100% coverage of client selection tracking
- 100% coverage of image optimization pipeline

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The portfolio system effectively organizes and presents images by category with appropriate layouts
2. The client proofing system accurately manages private galleries with selection tracking
3. The protection features correctly apply watermarks and prevent unauthorized downloads
4. The metadata system effectively organizes and allows searching across large image libraries
5. The optimization pipeline generates appropriate web-ready assets for all images

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
2. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
