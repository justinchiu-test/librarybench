# Multi-Location Restaurant CMS

A specialized content management system designed for restaurant chains to maintain brand consistency while allowing location-specific customization.

## Overview

Multi-Location Restaurant CMS is a comprehensive content management library tailored for regional restaurant chains. It enables marketing directors to coordinate promotions across all locations while allowing individual restaurant managers to update their specific details and local specials, maintaining brand consistency while accommodating local variations.

## Persona Description

Priya oversees marketing for a regional restaurant chain with multiple locations, each needing location-specific content while maintaining brand consistency. Her primary goal is to coordinate promotions across locations while allowing individual restaurant managers to update their specific details and local specials.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-location Management System**: Develop a hierarchical content management framework with centralized and location-specific control layers. This is critical for Priya as it enables corporate-level brand consistency while empowering individual restaurant managers to maintain accurate location details, creating an effective balance between standardized branding and local relevance.

2. **Location-specific Menu Management**: Create a flexible menu system that handles core items with location-specific pricing variations and local specialty items. This feature is essential as it allows each restaurant to reflect local pricing conditions, feature regional specialties, and accommodate location-specific inventory without sacrificing the unified brand experience.

3. **Promotion Scheduling with Override Capabilities**: Implement a comprehensive promotion management system with corporate scheduling and location-specific override options. This functionality is vital for coordinating chain-wide promotional campaigns while giving individual locations the flexibility to adapt to local market conditions or special circumstances.

4. **Franchise Compliance Dashboard**: Develop a monitoring system that tracks content update compliance across all locations. This capability is crucial for Priya to ensure that all restaurants meet brand standards and implement required promotions and updates, identifying locations that need support while recognizing those that maintain excellent compliance.

5. **Brand Asset Management System**: Create a centralized brand resource library with usage guidelines enforcement. This feature is important for maintaining consistent visual identity across all locations, ensuring that all restaurants have access to approved logos, images, and marketing materials while preventing unapproved modifications that could dilute brand equity.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have unit tests with at least 90% coverage
- Location override logic must be thoroughly tested
- Menu pricing variability must be verifiable through test fixtures
- Promotion scheduling must be validated with comprehensive test cases
- Brand asset access controls must be tested for proper enforcement

### Performance Expectations
- Multi-location view generation must complete within 300ms
- Menu updates should propagate within 500ms
- Promotion scheduling operations should process within 200ms
- Compliance dashboard must render within 1s with 100+ locations
- Asset library searches should return results within 100ms

### Integration Points
- Support for common storage backends (local filesystem, SQLite, optional cloud storage)
- Point of sale system integration capabilities
- Integration with review aggregation services
- Online ordering system compatibility
- Social media scheduling integration

### Key Constraints

   - Menu categorization and organization

3. **Promotion Management**:
   - Campaign creation and scheduling
   - Location applicability rules
   - Override request and approval workflow
   - Promotion assets and materials
   - Performance tracking

4. **Compliance Monitoring**:
   - Update verification and tracking
   - Required content checklists
   - Notification and reminder system
   - Compliance reporting and analytics
   - Support flagging for non-compliant locations

5. **Brand Asset Library**:
   - Digital asset management with versioning
   - Usage rights and guidelines
   - Asset categorization and tagging
   - Approval workflows for customized assets
   - Usage tracking and analytics

6. **Local Content Management**:
   - Location-specific news and events
   - Community involvement features
   - Local team and management profiles
   - Area-specific special offerings
   - Neighborhood information

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Creation and management of content across multiple locations
- Proper implementation of location-specific menu pricing
- Correct scheduling and override behavior for promotions
- Accurate tracking and reporting of compliance status
- Appropriate access control for brand assets

### Critical User Scenarios
- Rolling out a new corporate promotion while allowing specific locations to opt out
- Updating menu pricing in specific regions based on local costs
- Monitoring franchise compliance with required content updates
- Distributing new brand assets with usage guidelines
- Allowing a location manager to feature a local special

### Performance Benchmarks
- Corporate dashboard loading time with growing number of locations
- Menu update propagation time to affected locations
- Promotion scheduling with complex location rules
- Compliance calculation time for the entire restaurant chain
- Asset library performance with large number of brand resources

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling conflicting promotion schedules
- Managing menu items that are discontinued at some locations
- Recovery from incomplete content updates
- Behavior when compliance monitoring encounters location issues
- Handling unauthorized brand asset modification attempts

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all core components
- 100% coverage of location override logic
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests for multi-location operations
- Security tests for access control mechanisms

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Corporate content and branding can be managed centrally while allowing location-specific customization
2. Menu items and pricing can be both standardized and customized by location as needed
3. Promotions can be scheduled chain-wide with appropriate location-specific exceptions
4. Compliance with brand standards can be effectively monitored across all locations
5. Brand assets are consistently used according to guidelines at all restaurants
6. All operations can be performed programmatically through a well-documented API
7. The entire system can be thoroughly tested using pytest with high coverage
8. Performance meets or exceeds the specified benchmarks

## Setup and Development

To set up your development environment:

1. Create a new Python library project:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install necessary development dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Run a specific test:
   ```
   uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name
   ```

5. Format code:
   ```
   uv run ruff format
   ```

6. Lint code:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   ```

7. Type check:
   ```
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to adhere to the code style guidelines in the project's CLAUDE.md file, including proper type hints, docstrings, and error handling.
