# Multi-Location Restaurant Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system for restaurant chains that enables centralized brand control with location-specific customization, variable menu management, promotion scheduling, franchise compliance tracking, and brand asset management. This system focuses on maintaining brand consistency while allowing for necessary local variations.

## Persona Description
Priya oversees marketing for a regional restaurant chain with multiple locations, each needing location-specific content while maintaining brand consistency. Her primary goal is to coordinate promotions across locations while allowing individual restaurant managers to update their specific details and local specials.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-location Management with Centralized and Local Control**
   - Implement a hierarchical content management system with granular permission levels
   - Critical for Priya because it allows her to maintain consistent branding and messaging across all locations while empowering individual restaurant managers to customize content relevant to their specific location

2. **Menu System with Location-specific Pricing Variations**
   - Create a menu management system that supports price variations by location
   - Essential for accommodating different pricing strategies based on local market conditions, overhead costs, and competitive landscapes while maintaining consistent menu items and descriptions

3. **Promotion Scheduler with Location-specific Override Options**
   - Develop a promotion planning system with both chain-wide and location-specific capabilities
   - Important for coordinating marketing campaigns across the entire chain while allowing individual locations to opt-out or customize promotions based on local preferences or inventory constraints

4. **Franchise-specific Dashboard Showing Content Update Compliance**
   - Implement a monitoring system for tracking location adherence to required content updates
   - Necessary for ensuring all locations comply with mandatory content changes (like seasonal menus or corporate promotions) while identifying which restaurants require follow-up

5. **Brand Asset Library with Usage Guidelines Enforcement**
   - Create a digital asset management system with usage rule enforcement
   - Crucial for protecting brand integrity by providing location managers with approved assets and ensuring they are used correctly according to brand guidelines

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Multi-location permission system must be testable with various hierarchy scenarios
- Menu pricing variations must be verifiable across different locations
- Promotion scheduling must support time-based testing with override conditions
- Compliance tracking must be testable with simulated update scenarios
- Asset usage enforcement must verify guideline adherence

### Performance Expectations
- Content hierarchy must support at least 100 locations with < 300ms access time
- Menu system must handle 500+ items with location-specific variations efficiently
- Promotion scheduler should process chain-wide updates in < 30 seconds
- Compliance dashboard should generate reports in < 10 seconds
- Asset library should support at least 10,000 brand assets with fast retrieval

### Integration Points
- Point-of-sale systems for menu pricing synchronization
- Marketing calendar for promotion coordination
- Notification system for compliance alerts
- Digital asset processing pipeline
- Analytics platform for content performance

### Key Constraints
- No UI components, only API endpoints and business logic
- Support for complex hierarchical permissions model
- Robust content versioning and approval workflows
- Clear audit trails for all content changes
- Scalability for growing number of locations

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Multi-Location Restaurant CMS includes:

1. **Hierarchical Content Management**
   - Organization structure definition with inheritance rules
   - Permission model with central and local control
   - Content approval workflows with stakeholder roles
   - Change notification and distribution system

2. **Location-aware Menu Management**
   - Menu item definition with core and variable attributes
   - Location-specific pricing and availability rules
   - Seasonal and time-based menu variations
   - Nutritional and allergen information tracking

3. **Promotion Planning System**
   - Campaign definition with scheduling parameters
   - Location targeting and exemption capabilities
   - Promotion assets and messaging management
   - Performance tracking and reporting

4. **Compliance Monitoring**
   - Update requirement definition and distribution
   - Implementation tracking and verification
   - Reporting and notification system
   - Escalation workflow for non-compliance

5. **Brand Asset Management**
   - Asset categorization and metadata organization
   - Usage guideline definition and linkage
   - Usage verification and enforcement
   - Version control and update distribution

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Content creation and distribution across location hierarchy
- Menu management with price variations by location
- Promotion scheduling with both central and local controls
- Compliance tracking for required content updates
- Asset management with usage guideline enforcement

### Critical User Scenarios
- Updating core brand messaging with location-specific adaptations
- Managing menu price changes across multiple locations
- Scheduling a chain-wide promotion with location-specific variations
- Tracking compliance with a mandatory menu update
- Distributing new brand assets with usage guidelines

### Performance Benchmarks
- Content distribution time across the location hierarchy
- Menu update propagation to all applicable locations
- Promotion scheduler performance with complex rules
- Compliance dashboard generation time with full location data
- Asset library search and retrieval response times

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling conflicting updates between central and local management
- Managing menu items unavailable at specific locations
- Resolving promotion conflicts or timing issues
- Addressing persistent compliance failures
- Managing guideline violations in asset usage

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of permission-critical code paths
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must verify all benchmark requirements
- Security tests for permission model vulnerabilities

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Content can be managed centrally while allowing location-specific variations
2. Menu items can be maintained with location-specific pricing
3. Promotions can be scheduled chain-wide with local customization options
4. Compliance with required updates can be effectively tracked
5. Brand assets can be distributed with enforced usage guidelines
6. All operations can be performed via API without any UI components
7. The system handles the expected performance requirements under load
8. The permission model correctly enforces central and local control boundaries
9. All tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works as expected
