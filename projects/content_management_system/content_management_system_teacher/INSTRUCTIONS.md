# Educational Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system designed for independent teachers to manage curriculum, student resources, and course registration. This system enables educators to create password-protected areas for current students while showcasing teaching philosophy and course offerings to prospective clients.

## Persona Description
Elena offers specialized education courses and needs a platform to share her curriculum, student resources, and course registration. Her primary goal is to create password-protected areas for current students while showcasing her teaching philosophy and course offerings to prospective clients.

## Key Requirements

1. **Membership system with course-specific access controls**
   - Critical for Elena to provide exclusive content to enrolled students while maintaining separate areas for each course
   - Must support multiple permission levels (prospect, enrolled student, alumni) with appropriate access restrictions
   - Should include secure authentication with password recovery and account management

2. **Interactive lesson planner with embedded exercise templates**
   - Essential for organizing course materials into structured lessons with clear progression
   - Must support various content types (text, code snippets, downloadable resources, embedded media)
   - Should include reusable exercise templates that can be customized for different courses

3. **Assignment submission portal with feedback mechanism**
   - Important for collecting student work and providing individualized feedback
   - Must track submission status, deadlines, and completion records
   - Should support private teacher-student communication regarding submissions

4. **Progress tracking dashboard for student engagement**
   - Necessary for monitoring individual and class-wide participation and achievement
   - Must track lesson completion, assignment submission, and assessment scores
   - Should provide analytics on student engagement patterns and learning outcomes

5. **Certificate generation for course completion**
   - Valuable for providing students with formal recognition of their accomplishments
   - Must generate professional certificates based on customizable templates
   - Should include verification system for authenticity confirmation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must verify the membership system correctly restricts content access
- Performance tests must verify content delivery under various load conditions
- Mock authentication system for testing access controls

### Performance Expectations
- Lesson content must load within 1 second regardless of embedded resources
- Assignment submissions must process within 3 seconds including file uploads
- Progress calculations must update within 500ms of new activity
- Certificate generation must complete within 5 seconds

### Integration Points
- Authentication system with secure password management
- File storage system for learning materials and submissions
- Email notification service for assignment feedback and course announcements
- PDF generation for certificates and course materials

### Key Constraints
- All student data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Content access logs must be maintained for audit purposes
- System must work offline for downloaded course materials
- Resource storage must enforce size and type restrictions

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library with the following core components:

1. **Membership and Access Control**
   - User management with role-based permissions
   - Course enrollment and access control
   - Authentication and session management
   - Profile and account management

2. **Curriculum and Content Management**
   - Lesson structure and organization
   - Content type handling (text, media, downloads)
   - Exercise template management
   - Curriculum sequencing and prerequisites

3. **Assignment Management**
   - Assignment definition and configuration
   - Submission handling and storage
   - Feedback and grading system
   - Deadline management and notifications

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Activity logging and completion tracking
   - Performance metrics and statistics
   - Engagement analytics
   - Learning pathway visualization

5. **Certification System**
   - Certificate template management
   - Completion criteria validation
   - Certificate generation and delivery
   - Verification system for authenticity

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Access controls correctly limit content based on enrollment status
- Lesson planner accurately organizes and delivers content in proper sequence
- Assignment system correctly handles submissions and tracks feedback
- Progress tracking accurately reflects student activity and achievement
- Certificate generation produces valid documents based on completion criteria

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a new course with structured curriculum and exercises
- Enrolling students with appropriate access permissions
- Managing assignment submission, grading, and feedback cycle
- Tracking student progress through a complete course
- Generating and verifying course completion certificates

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must support at least 100 concurrent students accessing content
- File uploads for assignments must handle files up to 25MB
- Progress dashboard must calculate metrics for 50+ students in under 2 seconds
- Content management must handle courses with 100+ lessons and resources

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling interrupted uploads during assignment submission
- Managing course access after enrollment expiration
- Recovering from incomplete lesson completion data
- Dealing with duplicate submission attempts
- Managing certificate revocation for academic integrity issues

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of access control logic
- 100% coverage of certificate generation and verification
- 100% coverage of progress calculation algorithms

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The membership system correctly restricts content access based on enrollment status
2. The lesson planner effectively organizes and delivers curriculum content
3. The assignment system properly handles submissions and facilitates feedback
4. The progress tracking system accurately reflects student activity and achievement
5. The certification system generates valid completion documents

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
2. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
