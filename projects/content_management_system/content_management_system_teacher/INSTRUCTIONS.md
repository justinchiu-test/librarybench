# Educational Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system for independent educators that provides course-specific access controls, curriculum organization, assignment management, and student progress tracking. This system focuses on securely delivering educational content while showcasing the teacher's expertise to prospective students.

## Persona Description
Elena offers specialized education courses and needs a platform to share her curriculum, student resources, and course registration. Her primary goal is to create password-protected areas for current students while showcasing her teaching philosophy and course offerings to prospective clients.

## Key Requirements

1. **Membership System with Course-Specific Access Controls**
   - Implement a secure access control system that manages student access to specific course materials
   - Critical for Elena because it allows her to protect her premium content while ensuring current students can easily access the materials they've paid for without exposing them to non-enrolled users

2. **Interactive Lesson Planner with Exercise Templates**
   - Create a lesson content management system with support for structured exercises
   - Essential for Elena to organize her curriculum in a logical manner with interactive elements that enhance the learning experience while maintaining consistent formatting across lessons

3. **Assignment Submission and Feedback System**
   - Develop a system for collecting student work and providing structured feedback
   - Important for facilitating the assignment workflow between Elena and her students, allowing her to efficiently collect work, provide comments, and track completion status

4. **Student Progress Tracking**
   - Implement a comprehensive analytics system for monitoring student engagement and progress
   - Necessary for Elena to understand how students interact with course materials, identify struggling students, and measure the effectiveness of her teaching materials

5. **Certificate Generation**
   - Create a system for generating and managing course completion certificates
   - Crucial for providing students with formal recognition of their achievements, adding value to Elena's courses and creating shareable credentials that help market her services

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Access control rules must be independently testable with various permission scenarios
- Lesson content management should be testable with mock curriculum data
- Assignment workflow must support simulated submission and feedback cycles
- Progress tracking should allow for synthetic student activity data
- Certificate generation must be testable with various completion conditions

### Performance Expectations
- Content access checks must execute in < 50ms to maintain smooth user experience
- System should support at least 100 concurrent students across multiple courses
- Assignment submission processing should handle files up to 50MB with reasonable performance
- Progress calculations should complete within 1 second even with complex metrics
- Certificate generation should take < 3 seconds including digital signatures

### Integration Points
- Authentication system with JWT or similar token-based security
- Content storage interface with versioning capabilities
- File submission handling with virus scanning hooks
- Analytics data aggregation and reporting
- PDF generation for certificates and reports

### Key Constraints
- No UI components, only API endpoints and business logic
- Strict content access controls based on enrollment status
- Data privacy compliance for educational records
- Scalability to handle growing course catalog and student base
- Minimal external dependencies beyond Python standard library

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Educational CMS includes:

1. **Access Control System**
   - User authentication and session management
   - Course-specific permission rules
   - Enrollment tracking and verification
   - Public vs. private content designation

2. **Curriculum Content Management**
   - Structured lesson organization and sequencing
   - Exercise template definition and instantiation
   - Multimedia content organization
   - Version control for course materials

3. **Assignment Management**
   - Assignment definition with requirements and rubrics
   - Submission collection and organization
   - Feedback recording and distribution
   - Grading and assessment tracking

4. **Analytics and Progress Tracking**
   - Content engagement metrics collection
   - Progress calculation based on completion criteria
   - Performance analytics across multiple dimensions
   - Student activity monitoring and reporting

5. **Certification System**
   - Completion criteria definition and verification
   - Certificate template management
   - Automated generation of personalized credentials
   - Verification system for certificate authenticity

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Course access control based on enrollment status
- Curriculum creation, organization, and delivery
- Assignment submission workflow and feedback cycle
- Student progress tracking and analytics
- Certificate generation and validation

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating and organizing a structured course curriculum
- Enrolling students with appropriate access permissions
- Assigning and collecting work with instructor feedback
- Tracking individual and group progress through course materials
- Generating certificates for students who meet completion criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- Access control check performance under concurrent load
- Content delivery response times with varied lesson sizes
- Assignment submission handling with large file attachments
- Analytics calculation speed with growing student activity data
- Certificate generation throughput for class-wide completion

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling permission edge cases (course transfers, expired enrollments)
- Managing curriculum updates for courses in progress
- Recovering from interrupted assignment submissions
- Detecting and addressing unusual progress patterns
- Handling certificate generation for students with missing requirements

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of permission-critical code paths
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must verify all benchmark requirements
- Security tests for access control vulnerabilities

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Course content can be securely managed with proper access controls
2. Curriculum can be organized into structured lessons with interactive elements
3. Assignments can be created, submitted, and given feedback through the API
4. Student progress can be tracked with meaningful analytics
5. Certificates can be automatically generated based on completion criteria
6. All operations can be performed via API without any UI components
7. The system handles the expected performance requirements under load
8. Access controls correctly protect content in all scenarios
9. All tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works as expected
