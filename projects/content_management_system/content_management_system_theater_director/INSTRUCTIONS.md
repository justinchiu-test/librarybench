# Theater Production Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system designed for community theater groups that enables collaborative content editing with fine-grained permissions, production scheduling, cast management, and ticketing integration. This system focuses on delegating content responsibilities while maintaining consistent branding across the theatrical organization.

## Persona Description
Marcus manages a community theater group and needs to update their website with new productions, cast information, and ticket sales. His primary goal is to delegate specific content responsibilities to different team members while maintaining consistent branding and design across the entire site.

## Key Requirements

1. **Role-based Content Editing with Section Permissions**
   - Implement a granular permission system that allows different team members to edit specific content sections
   - Critical for Marcus because it enables him to delegate responsibilities (e.g., letting the costume designer update their section while preventing unauthorized edits to other areas) while maintaining overall site consistency

2. **Event Calendar with Production Scheduling**
   - Create a robust calendar system for managing rehearsals, performances, and other theater events
   - Essential for Marcus to coordinate the complex scheduling needs of a theater company, including multiple overlapping production timelines, venue availability, and public performances

3. **Cast and Crew Directory Management**
   - Develop a system for managing performer and staff profiles with production history
   - Important for showcasing the talented individuals involved in productions while maintaining an organized historical record of past participants and their roles

4. **Ticket Sales Tracking with Seat Visualization**
   - Implement a ticketing data management system with seat selection capabilities
   - Necessary for Marcus to monitor ticket sales, track available seating, and manage the theater's revenue stream for different productions and performance dates

5. **Production Media Gallery**
   - Create a media organization system categorized by production with video integration
   - Crucial for archiving and showcasing the visual elements of each production, allowing the theater to build a historical record and marketing materials for promoting shows

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Each role permission combination must be independently testable
- Calendar and scheduling functions must support time manipulation for testing
- Directory and gallery components must be testable with mock data
- Ticketing modules must support simulated sales scenarios
- API endpoints must be testable without UI dependencies

### Performance Expectations
- Directory searches must return results in < 100ms even with 1000+ cast/crew profiles
- Calendar operations should support at least 5 years of historical and future events
- Media gallery must handle at least 10,000 assets with efficient retrieval
- Permission checks should add minimal overhead (< 20ms) to content operations
- System should handle concurrent editing by at least 20 team members

### Integration Points
- Calendar data export in iCal and other standard formats
- Ticketing data interchange with external sales platforms
- Media storage interface with configurable backends
- Directory data import/export for season program generation
- Role-based authentication system integration

### Key Constraints
- Authorization must be separate from content management logic
- All operations must be performable via API without UI
- No direct database implementation dependencies
- Content structure must maintain consistent branding regardless of editor
- System must function with minimal dependencies beyond Python standard library

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Theater Production CMS includes:

1. **Permission and Role Management**
   - Define granular content section permissions
   - Manage user roles with inheritance capabilities
   - Role assignment and permission verification
   - Audit trail of content changes by role

2. **Event and Production Management**
   - Calendar-based event creation and editing
   - Production timeline with multiple event types
   - Rehearsal vs. performance scheduling
   - Recurring event patterns and exceptions

3. **Directory Services**
   - Cast and crew profile management
   - Production-specific role assignments
   - Biography and credit management
   - Searchable directory with filtering options

4. **Ticketing System**
   - Seat inventory management
   - Sales tracking and reporting
   - Seat selection data representation
   - Performance-specific pricing and availability

5. **Media Asset Management**
   - Production-categorized media organization
   - Video hosting integration capabilities
   - Metadata and tagging for assets
   - Gallery generation and organization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Role-based access control for content sections
- Calendar creation and manipulation with event scheduling
- Directory entry creation, updating, and production association
- Ticket sales data recording and seat availability tracking
- Media upload, categorization, and retrieval

### Critical User Scenarios
- Assigning section-specific editing permissions to team members
- Creating a new production with complete schedule of rehearsals and performances
- Adding and managing cast and crew for a specific production
- Tracking ticket sales and remaining seats for multiple performances
- Organizing production photos and videos by production and category

### Performance Benchmarks
- Directory search response time with growing cast/crew database
- Calendar query performance with multi-year data
- Gallery retrieval performance with large media collections
- Permission verification overhead during content operations
- Concurrent editing operations by multiple users

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling permission conflicts between roles
- Managing schedule conflicts for venues and participants
- Handling duplicate cast/crew entries and merging profiles
- Managing sold-out performances and waiting lists
- Recovering from failed media uploads or corrupted assets

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of permission-gated operations
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must verify all benchmark requirements
- Security tests for all permission combinations

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Content editing permissions can be assigned by section with proper isolation
2. Productions can be scheduled with complete rehearsal and performance calendars
3. Cast and crew directory can be managed with production-specific associations
4. Ticket sales and seat availability can be accurately tracked across performances
5. Media assets can be organized and retrieved by production and category
6. All operations can be performed via API without any UI components
7. The system handles the expected performance requirements under load
8. Permission boundaries are enforced correctly in all scenarios
9. All tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works as expected
