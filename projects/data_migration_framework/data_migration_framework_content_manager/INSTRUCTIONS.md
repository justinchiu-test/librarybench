# PyMigrate Content Management Migration Framework

## Overview
A specialized data migration framework designed for content managers migrating between CMS platforms while preserving rich media, metadata, and complex content relationships. This implementation maintains SEO value, handles multi-format media transformation, and ensures content integrity across different content management systems.

## Persona Description
A content manager migrating between CMS platforms who needs to preserve rich media, metadata, and content relationships. She wants to maintain SEO value and URL structures during migration.

## Key Requirements

1. **Rich media migration with format conversion and optimization**
   - Intelligently converts media between formats while optimizing for web delivery. Handles images, videos, audio, and documents with automatic quality adjustment, responsive variants generation, and format compatibility ensuring content displays correctly in the target CMS.

2. **SEO metadata preservation with redirect mapping**
   - Critical for maintaining search rankings and organic traffic. Preserves meta titles, descriptions, structured data, and creates comprehensive redirect maps from old to new URLs, preventing broken links and preserving link equity.

3. **Content relationship graph migration with link integrity**
   - Maintains complex content relationships including cross-references, related articles, category hierarchies, and tag associations. Ensures internal links remain functional and content discovery paths stay intact after migration.

4. **Multi-language content synchronization with translation memory**
   - Coordinates migration of multilingual content while maintaining language relationships. Preserves translation memories, handles locale-specific content variations, and ensures consistent content structure across all language versions.

5. **CDN cache invalidation coordination during migration**
   - Orchestrates cache purging across CDN networks to ensure visitors see updated content immediately. Implements intelligent invalidation strategies that minimize performance impact while ensuring content freshness during migration phases.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable via pytest without manual intervention
- Mock CMS APIs for various platforms
- Simulated media processing pipelines
- CDN invalidation API mocking

### Performance Expectations
- Process 10,000+ content items per hour
- Media conversion with parallel processing
- Maintain <2 second page load times during migration
- Support for 100GB+ media libraries

### Integration Points
- CMS APIs (WordPress, Drupal, Contentful, Strapi)
- Media processing libraries (Pillow, FFmpeg, ImageMagick)
- CDN APIs (Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly)
- SEO tools and sitemap generators

### Key Constraints
- Preserve content fidelity across platforms
- Maintain URL structure for SEO
- Zero broken links post-migration
- Minimal downtime for content delivery

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Media Processing Pipeline**: Detects source media formats and characteristics, converts between formats with quality preservation, generates responsive image variants, and optimizes file sizes for web delivery

2. **SEO Preservation Engine**: Extracts and maps all SEO-relevant metadata, generates 301 redirect configurations, maintains URL slugs and permalinks, and preserves structured data markup

3. **Content Graph Analyzer**: Maps content relationships and dependencies, identifies and preserves link structures, maintains taxonomy relationships, and ensures referential integrity

4. **Translation Coordinator**: Aligns content across language versions, maintains translation relationships, preserves locale-specific variations, and synchronizes publication states

5. **CDN Invalidation Manager**: Batches invalidation requests efficiently, implements progressive cache warming, coordinates with migration phases, and monitors cache hit rates

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Media conversion maintains visual/audio quality
- SEO metadata transfers completely and accurately
- Content relationships remain intact post-migration
- Multi-language content stays synchronized
- CDN invalidation ensures content freshness

### Critical User Scenarios
- Migrating a news site with 100K articles and images
- Preserving SEO for an e-commerce blog during replatforming
- Maintaining complex documentation site with cross-references
- Migrating multilingual corporate site with regional content
- Coordinating CDN updates during live migration

### Performance Benchmarks
- Convert 1000 images per minute with optimization
- Process 10K content items maintaining all relationships
- Generate redirect map for 100K URLs in <5 minutes
- Synchronize 10 language versions simultaneously
- Complete CDN invalidation for 50K objects in <10 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Corrupted media files in source CMS
- Circular content references
- Missing translations for some languages
- CDN API rate limiting
- Incompatible content types between platforms

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage with pytest
- Media format conversion quality tests
- SEO preservation validation
- Content relationship integrity checks
- Multi-language synchronization tests

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. **All tests pass** when run with pytest, with 90%+ code coverage
2. **A valid pytest_results.json file** is generated showing all tests passing
3. **Media migration** preserves quality while optimizing for web
4. **SEO preservation** maintains search rankings post-migration
5. **Content relationships** remain fully functional
6. **Multi-language support** keeps all versions synchronized
7. **CDN coordination** ensures zero stale content delivery

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/data_migration_framework_content_manager
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Install the project and run tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

**REMINDER**: The pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY and must be included to demonstrate that all tests pass successfully.
