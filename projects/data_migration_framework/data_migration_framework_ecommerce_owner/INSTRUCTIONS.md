# PyMigrate E-commerce Payment Migration Framework

## Overview
A specialized data migration framework designed for e-commerce platform owners migrating between payment providers while ensuring zero transaction loss and maintaining business continuity. This implementation handles in-flight orders, preserves customer sessions, and enables gradual migration through sophisticated state management and A/B testing capabilities.

## Persona Description
An e-commerce platform owner migrating between payment providers who needs to ensure transaction continuity and handle in-flight orders. She requires sophisticated state management for business-critical migrations.

## Key Requirements

1. **In-flight transaction handling with graceful cutover**
   - Critical for zero-loss payment provider transitions. Tracks and manages orders in various states (pending authorization, captured, refunding) ensuring each completes on the appropriate provider while maintaining transaction integrity throughout the migration.

2. **Payment tokenization migration with PCI compliance**
   - Securely migrates stored payment tokens between providers while maintaining PCI DSS compliance. Implements secure token exchange protocols, handles re-tokenization workflows, and ensures customer payment methods remain functional without re-entry.

3. **Order state machine preservation across systems**
   - Maintains complex order workflows spanning multiple states (cart, checkout, payment, fulfillment, returns). Ensures state transitions remain valid across both systems during migration, preventing orders from being stuck in invalid states.

4. **Customer session migration with cart preservation**
   - Seamlessly transfers active shopping sessions including cart contents, user preferences, and checkout progress. Prevents customer frustration by maintaining their shopping context even as backend systems change.

5. **A/B testing support for gradual payment provider migration**
   - Enables controlled rollout of new payment provider with configurable traffic splitting. Supports cohort-based routing, performance comparison metrics, and instant rollback capabilities to minimize risk during transition.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable via pytest without manual intervention
- Mock payment provider APIs for testing
- Simulated transaction states and flows
- PCI compliance validation without real card data

### Performance Expectations
- Transaction cutover with <100ms customer impact
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent sessions
- Token migration rate of 1000+ per second
- State synchronization latency <500ms

### Integration Points
- Payment gateway APIs (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, etc.)
- E-commerce platforms (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce)
- Order management systems
- Session storage systems (Redis, Memcached)

### Key Constraints
- Zero transaction loss tolerance
- PCI DSS compliance throughout migration
- Maintain SLA during provider transition
- Support for multiple currency transactions

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Transaction State Manager**: Tracks in-flight transactions across providers, implements dual-write patterns for safety, manages provider-specific state mappings, and orchestrates graceful cutover sequences

2. **Token Migration Engine**: Implements secure token exchange protocols, handles provider-specific token formats, manages re-tokenization workflows, and maintains PCI compliance boundaries

3. **Order State Synchronizer**: Maps order states between systems, ensures atomic state transitions, handles compensating transactions, and provides state recovery mechanisms

4. **Session Migration Controller**: Captures active session data, transfers cart and preference information, maintains session continuity, and handles cross-domain challenges

5. **A/B Testing Router**: Implements percentage-based traffic routing, provides cohort management capabilities, tracks conversion metrics per provider, and enables instant traffic redistribution

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- In-flight transactions complete successfully on correct provider
- Payment tokens migrate without customer impact
- Order states remain consistent across systems
- Customer sessions transfer without data loss
- A/B testing accurately routes traffic

### Critical User Scenarios
- Customer completing checkout during provider cutover
- Processing refunds for orders from old provider
- Handling subscription renewals during migration
- Managing split shopping carts across providers
- Emergency rollback during peak shopping hours

### Performance Benchmarks
- Handle 1000 concurrent checkouts during migration
- Migrate 1M payment tokens in <1 hour
- Synchronize order states with <500ms latency
- Transfer 10K active sessions without drops
- Route traffic with <10ms decision overhead

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Payment authorization timeout during cutover
- Token migration failure for specific card types
- Order stuck between state transitions
- Session corruption during transfer
- Provider API unavailability

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 95% code coverage for payment-critical paths
- Transaction integrity tests across all scenarios
- PCI compliance validation tests
- Load tests simulating Black Friday traffic
- Failure injection tests for provider APIs

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. **All tests pass** when run with pytest, with 95%+ code coverage for payment paths
2. **A valid pytest_results.json file** is generated showing all tests passing
3. **Transaction handling** ensures zero payment loss during migration
4. **Token migration** maintains PCI compliance throughout
5. **State preservation** keeps all orders in valid states
6. **Session continuity** provides seamless customer experience
7. **A/B testing** enables risk-free gradual migration

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/data_migration_framework_ecommerce_owner
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Install the project and run tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

**REMINDER**: The pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY and must be included to demonstrate that all tests pass successfully.
