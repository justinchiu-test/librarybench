# PyMigrate Enterprise Consolidation Framework

## Overview
A specialized data migration framework designed for enterprise architects consolidating data from multiple legacy systems into modern data warehouses. This implementation focuses on orchestrating complex, multi-phase migrations across departments while minimizing business disruption through intelligent dependency management and real-time monitoring.

## Persona Description
An enterprise architect consolidating data from multiple legacy systems into a modern data warehouse who needs to orchestrate complex migrations across different departments. She requires comprehensive migration planning and coordination features to minimize business disruption.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-phase migration orchestration with inter-department dependencies**
   - Critical for managing complex enterprise migrations where departments depend on each other's data. This ensures data integrity across organizational boundaries and prevents cascading failures during migration phases.

2. **Business impact analysis with downtime estimation per migration phase**
   - Essential for executive buy-in and planning maintenance windows. Provides accurate estimates of how long each department's systems will be affected, allowing for proper resource allocation and business continuity planning.

3. **Parallel migration lanes for independent data domains**
   - Maximizes efficiency by allowing non-dependent data domains to migrate simultaneously. This significantly reduces overall migration time while maintaining data consistency within each domain.

4. **Executive dashboard with real-time migration status and KPIs**
   - Provides C-suite visibility into migration progress with key metrics like data volume migrated, error rates, and projected completion times. Critical for stakeholder communication and decision-making.

5. **Automated stakeholder notification system with customizable alerts**
   - Ensures all affected parties are informed of migration status, issues, and completions. Customizable alerts allow different stakeholders to receive relevant information based on their roles and responsibilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable via pytest without manual intervention
- Mock data sources and targets for testing migration logic
- Time-based testing capabilities for scheduling and notification features
- Performance benchmarking framework for large-scale data operations

### Performance Expectations
- Support for migrations handling 100TB+ of data across multiple sources
- Sub-second dependency resolution for complex migration graphs
- Real-time dashboard updates with <1 second latency
- Concurrent execution of up to 50 parallel migration lanes

### Integration Points
- Abstract interfaces for connecting to various data sources (databases, files, APIs)
- Plugin architecture for custom transformation rules
- Event-driven architecture for status updates and notifications
- RESTful API for dashboard data consumption

### Key Constraints
- Zero data loss tolerance with comprehensive rollback capabilities
- Audit trail for all migration operations
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
- Transaction consistency across distributed systems

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Migration Orchestrator**: Central coordinator managing migration phases, dependencies, and execution order based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG) of department dependencies

2. **Impact Analyzer**: Calculates business impact metrics including affected systems, data volume, estimated downtime, and resource requirements for each migration phase

3. **Parallel Execution Engine**: Manages concurrent migration lanes with resource pooling, load balancing, and automatic failure isolation

4. **KPI Calculator**: Real-time computation of migration metrics including throughput, error rates, completion percentage, and time estimates

5. **Notification Manager**: Event-driven notification system with role-based alert routing, customizable templates, and delivery confirmation tracking

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Dependency graph construction and validation for complex multi-department scenarios
- Accurate business impact calculations across various migration configurations
- Parallel execution with proper resource management and failure isolation
- Real-time KPI computation accuracy under high-load conditions
- Notification delivery and customization for different stakeholder groups

### Critical User Scenarios
- Orchestrating a 10-department migration with complex interdependencies
- Handling partial failures in one department without affecting others
- Providing accurate downtime estimates for maintenance window planning
- Delivering real-time status updates to 100+ stakeholders
- Rolling back a failed migration phase while preserving successful completions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Dependency resolution for 1000+ node graph in <100ms
- Sustained migration throughput of 10GB/minute per lane
- Dashboard update latency <1 second for 50 concurrent migrations
- Notification delivery to 1000 recipients within 10 seconds
- Memory usage <4GB for coordinating 100TB migration

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Circular dependencies in migration graph
- Source system becoming unavailable mid-migration
- Network partitions during distributed migration
- Conflicting data in parallel migration lanes
- Notification system failures and retry logic

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage with pytest
- Integration tests for all major components
- Performance tests validating benchmarks
- Stress tests for concurrent operations
- Failure injection tests for resilience validation

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. **All tests pass** when run with pytest, with 90%+ code coverage
2. **A valid pytest_results.json file** is generated showing all tests passing
3. **Multi-phase orchestration** correctly manages dependencies between 10+ departments
4. **Impact analysis** provides accurate downtime estimates within 10% margin
5. **Parallel execution** achieves 5x speedup compared to sequential migration
6. **Real-time dashboard** updates all KPIs within 1 second of state changes
7. **Notification system** delivers customized alerts to all stakeholders within defined SLAs

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/data_migration_framework_enterprise_architect
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Install the project and run tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

**REMINDER**: The pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY and must be included to demonstrate that all tests pass successfully.
