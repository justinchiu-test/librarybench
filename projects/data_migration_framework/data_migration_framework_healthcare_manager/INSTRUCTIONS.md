# PyMigrate Healthcare Compliance Migration Framework

## Overview
A specialized data migration framework designed for healthcare data managers migrating patient records between EMR systems with strict HIPAA compliance requirements. This implementation ensures data privacy, maintains comprehensive audit trails, and handles complex medical data transformations while preserving patient safety and regulatory compliance.

## Persona Description
A healthcare data manager migrating patient records between EMR systems who must ensure HIPAA compliance throughout the process. She needs strong audit trails and data privacy controls during migration.

## Key Requirements

1. **PHI-aware data masking during migration with reversible encryption**
   - Critical for protecting patient health information during transit and processing. Implements field-level encryption for sensitive data (SSN, diagnoses, medications) with secure key management and reversible masking for authorized access.

2. **Compliance audit log with immutable change records**
   - Essential for HIPAA compliance and regulatory audits. Creates tamper-proof logs of all data access, modifications, and migrations with cryptographic signatures ensuring record integrity and non-repudiation.

3. **Patient consent tracking for data migration authorization**
   - Manages patient consent status for data sharing and migration. Ensures only authorized records are migrated based on current consent status, with support for consent revocation and re-authorization workflows.

4. **Medical code mapping between different EMR standards (HL7, FHIR)**
   - Translates medical codes, terminology, and data structures between different EMR systems. Maintains clinical accuracy while converting between standards like ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and RxNorm.

5. **Break-glass access controls for emergency data recovery**
   - Provides emergency override capabilities for critical patient care situations. Implements strict authentication, justification requirements, and enhanced audit logging for all break-glass access events.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable via pytest without manual intervention
- Mock EMR systems with realistic healthcare data structures
- Simulated compliance scenarios and audit requirements
- Encryption/decryption testing without exposing real PHI

### Performance Expectations
- Encryption/decryption overhead <10ms per record
- Support for migrating 1M+ patient records
- Audit log write performance >10,000 events/second
- Code mapping resolution <50ms per translation

### Integration Points
- HL7 FHIR API interfaces for modern EMR systems
- Legacy HL7v2 message parsing and generation
- DICOM image migration capabilities
- Audit log integration with SIEM systems

### Key Constraints
- Zero PHI exposure in logs or error messages
- Maintain referential integrity across clinical data
- Support for partial record migration
- Compliance with HIPAA Technical Safeguards

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **PHI Encryption Engine**: Field-level encryption with format-preserving options, secure key derivation and rotation, support for searchable encryption, and compliance with FIPS 140-2 standards

2. **Immutable Audit Logger**: Blockchain-inspired append-only log structure, cryptographic hash chaining for tamper detection, structured audit events with clinical context, and integration with compliance reporting tools

3. **Consent Manager**: Patient consent state tracking with version history, consent type categorization (treatment, research, sharing), automated consent expiration handling, and integration with migration rule engine

4. **Medical Code Translator**: Comprehensive code mapping libraries for major standards, context-aware translation preserving clinical meaning, validation against standard code sets, and custom mapping rule support

5. **Break-Glass Controller**: Multi-factor authentication for emergency access, time-limited access windows with automatic revocation, detailed justification capture and review workflow, and enhanced audit trail with alerting

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- PHI encryption preserves data format while ensuring security
- Audit logs maintain immutability and completeness
- Consent tracking correctly controls data migration
- Medical code translations maintain clinical accuracy
- Break-glass access follows proper authorization flow

### Critical User Scenarios
- Migrating complete patient history with mixed consent status
- Handling emergency access during critical care situations
- Translating complex medication orders between EMR systems
- Maintaining audit trail during system failures
- Recovering from partial migration failures

### Performance Benchmarks
- Encrypt/decrypt 1000 patient records in <10 seconds
- Generate 1M audit events without log corruption
- Process consent updates for 10K patients in <1 minute
- Translate 100K medical codes with 99.9% accuracy
- Complete break-glass access workflow in <30 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Expired encryption keys during migration
- Consent revocation mid-migration
- Unknown medical codes requiring manual mapping
- Audit log storage failures
- Concurrent break-glass access attempts

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 95% code coverage for compliance-critical components
- Security testing for encryption and access controls
- Compliance validation against HIPAA requirements
- Integration tests with mock EMR systems
- Performance tests under healthcare data loads

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. **All tests pass** when run with pytest, with 95%+ code coverage for compliance components
2. **A valid pytest_results.json file** is generated showing all tests passing
3. **PHI protection** ensures zero sensitive data exposure in logs or errors
4. **Audit trail** captures 100% of data access and modifications
5. **Consent management** correctly enforces patient preferences
6. **Code translation** achieves 99%+ accuracy for standard medical codes
7. **Break-glass access** completes within 30 seconds with full audit trail

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/data_migration_framework_healthcare_manager
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Install the project and run tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

**REMINDER**: The pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY and must be included to demonstrate that all tests pass successfully.
