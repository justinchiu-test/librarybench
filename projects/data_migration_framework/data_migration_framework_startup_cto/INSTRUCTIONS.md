# PyMigrate Microservices Migration Framework

## Overview
A specialized data migration framework designed for CTOs transitioning from monolithic databases to microservices architectures. This implementation enables zero-downtime, incremental migration with bi-directional synchronization, ensuring data consistency during the critical transition period while both systems remain operational.

## Persona Description
A CTO at a fast-growing startup migrating from a monolithic database to microservices architecture who needs to ensure zero data loss during the transition. He wants to migrate incrementally while keeping both systems in sync during the transition period.

## Key Requirements

1. **Bi-directional sync mode for gradual migration with conflict resolution**
   - Essential for maintaining data consistency when both monolith and microservices are actively used. Provides configurable conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, priority-based, custom rules) to handle concurrent modifications.

2. **Service boundary detection for automatic data partitioning**
   - Analyzes data access patterns and relationships to suggest optimal service boundaries. Critical for avoiding distributed transactions and ensuring microservices independence while maintaining data cohesion.

3. **API endpoint generation for migrated data services**
   - Automatically generates RESTful API endpoints for newly created microservices. Ensures consistent API design patterns and includes versioning, pagination, and filtering capabilities out of the box.

4. **Real-time data consistency validation between old and new systems**
   - Continuously monitors data integrity across both systems with configurable consistency levels. Provides alerts for divergence and automatic reconciliation options to maintain trust during migration.

5. **Automated traffic routing with percentage-based migration control**
   - Enables gradual traffic shifting from monolith to microservices with fine-grained control. Supports canary deployments, A/B testing, and instant rollback capabilities for risk mitigation.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable via pytest without manual intervention
- Mock monolithic and microservice databases for testing
- Simulated network conditions for sync testing
- Traffic routing simulation capabilities

### Performance Expectations
- Sub-100ms sync latency for critical data paths
- Support for 10,000+ transactions per second
- Conflict detection within 1 second of occurrence
- API generation completing within 30 seconds per service

### Integration Points
- Database change capture mechanisms (triggers, CDC, binary logs)
- Service mesh integration for traffic management
- API gateway compatibility for routing rules
- Message queue interfaces for async synchronization

### Key Constraints
- Zero data loss guarantee during migration
- Eventual consistency with configurable lag tolerance
- Backward compatibility for existing monolith clients
- Stateless migration components for horizontal scaling

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Bi-directional Sync Engine**: Captures changes from both systems, applies transformation rules, manages conflict resolution, and ensures eventual consistency with configurable sync intervals

2. **Service Boundary Analyzer**: Examines data models, access patterns, and transaction boundaries to recommend optimal microservice decomposition with minimal cross-service dependencies

3. **API Generator**: Creates standardized REST endpoints with OpenAPI specifications, request/response validation, error handling, and built-in monitoring hooks

4. **Consistency Validator**: Performs continuous data comparison with efficient checksumming, identifies discrepancies, triggers reconciliation, and maintains audit logs

5. **Traffic Router**: Implements percentage-based routing with sticky sessions, health-check aware routing, gradual rollout capabilities, and instant rollback mechanisms

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Bi-directional sync accuracy under concurrent modifications
- Service boundary recommendations for various data models
- API endpoint generation completeness and correctness
- Consistency validation detecting all types of discrepancies
- Traffic routing accuracy and failover behavior

### Critical User Scenarios
- Migrating user authentication service while users are logging in
- Handling order processing during payment service extraction
- Maintaining inventory consistency during warehouse service migration
- Preserving session state during gradual traffic migration
- Rolling back a problematic service migration without data loss

### Performance Benchmarks
- Sync latency <100ms for 95th percentile of changes
- Process 10,000 concurrent modifications without data loss
- Generate API for 50-table service in <30 seconds
- Validate 1M records for consistency in <60 seconds
- Route 100K requests/second with <1ms overhead

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partition during bi-directional sync
- Conflicting schema changes in both systems
- Circular dependencies in service boundaries
- Database connection failures during migration
- Memory pressure with large data volumes

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage with pytest
- Integration tests for sync scenarios
- Load tests for performance validation
- Chaos engineering tests for failure handling
- End-to-end migration scenario tests

**IMPORTANT**:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. **All tests pass** when run with pytest, with 90%+ code coverage
2. **A valid pytest_results.json file** is generated showing all tests passing
3. **Bi-directional sync** maintains consistency with <100ms latency
4. **Service boundaries** are correctly identified for a 100-table monolith
5. **API generation** produces working endpoints for all migrated services
6. **Consistency validation** detects 100% of data discrepancies
7. **Traffic routing** successfully migrates load without dropping requests

**REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS**:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/data_migration_framework_startup_cto
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Install the project and run tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

**REMINDER**: The pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY and must be included to demonstrate that all tests pass successfully.
