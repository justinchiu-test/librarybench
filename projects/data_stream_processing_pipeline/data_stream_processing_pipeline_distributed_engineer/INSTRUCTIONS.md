# Globally Distributed Data Processing Framework

## Overview
A fault-tolerant, globally distributed data processing framework designed to maintain data consistency across multiple geographic regions while ensuring processing continuity during network partitions. This system provides exactly-once processing guarantees and optimal resource utilization through dynamic workload balancing.

## Persona Description
Tomas builds data processing infrastructure that spans multiple data centers to provide global availability and disaster recovery. His primary goal is to ensure data consistency across geographic regions while maintaining processing continuity during network partitions.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-region state synchronization with conflict resolution**
   - Robust state synchronization mechanism that maintains consistency across geographically distributed processing nodes
   - Essential for Tomas to ensure that processing results are consistent regardless of which region handles the data
   - Must include configurable conflict resolution strategies for handling concurrent modifications

2. **Exactly-once processing guarantees across distributed nodes**
   - End-to-end transaction management ensuring that each data element is processed exactly once
   - Critical for preventing data duplication or loss when processing spans multiple regions
   - Should include idempotent processing, transaction tracking, and recovery mechanisms

3. **Pipeline segment migration for dynamic load balancing**
   - Automated workload management that can relocate processing segments between regions
   - Necessary for optimizing resource utilization and responding to regional capacity changes
   - Must include state transfer, coordination mechanisms, and seamless cutover capabilities

4. **Backpressure propagation across network boundaries**
   - Cross-region flow control system that maintains processing stability under variable loads
   - Vital for preventing resource exhaustion and cascading failures in connected processing regions
   - Should include configurable backpressure strategies and cross-region signaling protocols

5. **Regional processing isolation with global aggregation**
   - Architecture that allows regions to process independently while maintaining global consistency
   - Crucial for maintaining availability during partial network outages or region failures
   - Must include eventual consistency guarantees and catch-up mechanisms for recovering regions

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Points
- Regional network infrastructure and inter-region connectivity
- Distributed database and storage systems
- Global service discovery and coordination services

   - Dynamic pipeline segment allocation
   - State migration protocols
   - Seamless processing handoff between regions

4. **Flow Control Architecture**
   - Cross-region backpressure signaling
   - Adaptive rate limiting
   - Resource protection during overload conditions
   - Fair resource allocation across processing streams

5. **Regional Isolation Framework**
   - Independent regional processing capabilities

   - Partial failure handling strategies
   - Catch-up procedures for rejoining regions

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Multi-region state consistency under normal operations
- Exactly-once processing guarantees across failure scenarios
- Workload balancing effectiveness and migration stability
- Backpressure effectiveness during load spikes
- System behavior during region isolation and recovery

### Critical User Scenarios
- Normal multi-region processing with full connectivity
- Partial network partition isolating subset of regions
- Complete region failure with subsequent recovery
- Gradual degradation of inter-region connectivity
- Data sovereignty requirements necessitating regional processing

### Performance Benchmarks
- Throughput within 10% of single-region processing for partitionable workloads
- Recovery time under 5 minutes following region failure
- State synchronization within 30 seconds of connectivity restoration
- Processing latency overhead under 50ms for cross-region coordination
- Resource utilization proportional to processing load in each region

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Simultaneous multi-region failures
- "Split-brain" scenarios during network partitions
- Asymmetric network degradation between regions
- Clock synchronization issues across regions
- Data corruption during state transfer

### Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% test coverage for coordination protocols
- Comprehensive testing of all identified failure modes
- Performance testing across projected regional configurations
- Security testing for cross-region communications
- Extended chaos testing (24+ hours) for stability verification

## Success Criteria
1. The system successfully maintains state consistency across multiple geographic regions with automatic conflict resolution
2. Each data element is processed exactly once regardless of network conditions or region failures
3. Processing segments dynamically migrate between regions to optimize resource utilization
4. Backpressure properly propagates across regions to maintain system stability under variable loads
5. Regions continue processing independently during network partitions while maintaining eventual global consistency
6. The system recovers from region failures within the specified RTO
7. Performance overhead for distributed operation remains within acceptable limits compared to single-region processing
