# Globally Distributed Data Stream Processing Framework

## Overview
A resilient and consistent data stream processing framework designed to operate across multiple geographic regions, ensuring high availability and data consistency even during network partitions. The system provides sophisticated state synchronization, exactly-once processing guarantees, and dynamic workload balancing across distributed nodes.

## Persona Description
Tomas builds data processing infrastructure that spans multiple data centers to provide global availability and disaster recovery. His primary goal is to ensure data consistency across geographic regions while maintaining processing continuity during network partitions.

## Key Requirements
1. **Multi-region state synchronization with conflict resolution**: Implement a state management system that consistently replicates pipeline processing state across geographically distributed data centers, with sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms when concurrent changes occur. This capability is essential for maintaining a coherent global view of processing state even when regions operate independently during network partitions.

2. **Exactly-once processing guarantees across distributed nodes**: Develop a transaction coordination framework that ensures every data record is processed exactly once, even in the presence of node failures, network disruptions, or processing retries. This semantic guarantee is critical for applications where duplicate processing could cause financial or data integrity issues.

3. **Pipeline segment migration for dynamic load balancing**: Create mechanisms for seamlessly relocating processing pipeline segments between nodes or regions without data loss or processing disruption. This dynamic rebalancing capability allows the system to adapt to changing workloads, hardware failures, or planned maintenance without affecting overall throughput.

4. **Backpressure propagation across network boundaries**: Implement a distributed backpressure system that can throttle data producers when any processing region becomes overloaded, with appropriate propagation of pressure signals across network boundaries. This end-to-end flow control prevents system instability during load spikes and ensures graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure.

5. **Regional processing isolation with global aggregation**: Design a hybrid processing model that allows regions to process data independently when needed (improving latency and resilience), while still supporting global aggregation and correlation for complete results. This approach balances the needs for local responsiveness with globally consistent views of processed data.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Must support simulation of various network partition scenarios
  - Needs deterministic testing of concurrent operations and conflict resolution
  - Requires reproducible chaos engineering experiments
  - Must support verification of exactly-once processing guarantees
  - Needs comprehensive metrics collection for performance validation

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Recovery time of less than 30 seconds after region failure
  - Cross-region state synchronization latency under 1 second
  - Support for at least 5 concurrent geographic regions
  - Throughput degradation of no more than 20% during network partitions
  - State migration time proportional to state size with minimal processing disruption

- **Integration Points**:
  - Distributed consensus systems (e.g., etcd-compatible APIs)
  - Reliable messaging systems for cross-region communication
  - Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
  - Cloud provider region-specific services
  - Distributed tracing systems for cross-region request tracking

- **Key Constraints**:
  - System must continue operating during multi-region network partitions
  - Implementation must provide exactly-once processing guarantees
  - Solution must be cloud-provider agnostic
  - Design must minimize cross-region data transfer for cost efficiency
  - All operations must be observable and debuggable across regions

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a framework for distributed stream processing that:

1. Manages consistent state replication across geographically distributed nodes
2. Implements coordination protocols for exactly-once processing semantics
3. Provides dynamic workload distribution with automatic rebalancing
4. Handles network partitions gracefully with continued operation
5. Implements cross-region backpressure propagation mechanisms
6. Supports both regional processing isolation and global aggregation
7. Allows runtime migration of processing components without data loss
8. Maintains comprehensive monitoring and failure detection
9. Provides conflict detection and resolution for concurrent state changes
10. Ensures transparent recovery from regional outages

The implementation should emphasize consistency, resilience, observability, and seamless operation across distributed environments while maintaining processing guarantees.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct state synchronization across regions
  - Exactly-once processing guarantees during various failure scenarios
  - Proper pipeline segment migration and rebalancing
  - Effective backpressure propagation across network boundaries
  - Appropriate regional isolation with global aggregation

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - System behavior during complete region failure and recovery
  - Performance during temporary network partition between regions
  - Processing continuity during planned maintenance and migrations
  - Data consistency during concurrent operations across regions
  - Backpressure handling during partial system overload

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - State synchronization latency under 1 second between regions
  - Recovery time under 30 seconds for region failure scenarios
  - Throughput maintenance within 20% during degraded conditions
  - Pipeline segment migration time proportional to state size
  - Global aggregation results available within 5 seconds of local processing

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Prolonged network partition scenarios with concurrent state changes
  - Partial region failures affecting only some processing components
  - "Split-brain" scenarios where regions temporarily operate independently
  - Cascading failure scenarios with multiple component outages
  - Recovery from corrupted or inconsistent state situations

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of synchronization and coordination mechanisms
  - >90% line coverage for all production code
  - 100% coverage of failure recovery paths
  - Comprehensive tests for all distributed processing guarantees
  - Simulation testing for all identified network partition scenarios

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation will demonstrate:

1. Consistent state synchronization across multiple regions
2. Exactly-once processing guarantees even during failure scenarios
3. Dynamic load balancing through pipeline segment migration
4. Effective backpressure propagation across distributed components
5. Appropriate regional isolation with accurate global aggregation
6. Resilience to network partitions and region failures
7. Comprehensive test coverage with all tests passing

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions

To setup the development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
