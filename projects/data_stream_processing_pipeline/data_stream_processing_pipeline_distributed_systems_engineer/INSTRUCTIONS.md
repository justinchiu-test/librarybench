# Globally Distributed Data Stream Processing Framework

## Overview
A resilient, globally distributed data stream processing framework designed to maintain consistency and availability across multiple geographic regions. The system ensures reliable data processing continuity during network partitions and supports seamless cross-region coordination while enforcing exactly-once processing guarantees.

## Persona Description
Tomas builds data processing infrastructure that spans multiple data centers to provide global availability and disaster recovery. His primary goal is to ensure data consistency across geographic regions while maintaining processing continuity during network partitions.

## Key Requirements
1. **Multi-region state synchronization with conflict resolution**
   - Implement efficient state replication mechanisms across geographically distributed nodes
   - Support configurable consistency models with tunable trade-offs
   - Provide automatic conflict detection and resolution strategies
   - Include monitoring for synchronization health and lag metrics
   - This feature is critical for maintaining a coherent global view across all processing regions, enabling consistent outputs regardless of which region processes the data while providing mechanisms to resolve inevitable conflicts in a distributed environment

2. **Exactly-once processing guarantees across distributed nodes**
   - Implement distributed transaction coordination for stream processing operations
   - Support idempotent processing with deduplication capabilities
   - Provide persistent checkpoint mechanisms with global consistency
   - Include recovery procedures for failed operations
   - This capability ensures that stream events are processed exactly once across the distributed system, preventing both missed events and duplicate processing that could lead to data integrity issues

3. **Pipeline segment migration for dynamic load balancing**
   - Implement seamless transfer of processing responsibilities between nodes and regions
   - Support stateful migration with minimal processing disruption
   - Provide intelligent load distribution based on resource availability and network conditions
   - Include monitoring and control interfaces for migration operations
   - This feature enables the system to dynamically redistribute processing load based on regional traffic patterns, infrastructure failures, or cost considerations without disrupting the overall pipeline operation

4. **Backpressure propagation across network boundaries**
   - Implement cross-region flow control mechanisms
   - Support adaptive rate limiting based on end-to-end pipeline capacity
   - Provide configurable backpressure strategies with different degradation paths
   - Include detailed metrics for bottleneck identification
   - This capability ensures that pressure from processing bottlenecks is properly communicated across the entire distributed system, preventing resource exhaustion and cascading failures by throttling input rates appropriately

5. **Regional processing isolation with global aggregation**
   - Implement localized processing boundaries with global result aggregation
   - Support regional autonomy during network partitions
   - Provide mechanisms for reconciliation after connectivity restoration
   - Include policies for region-specific processing rules and data governance
   - This feature enables continued operation in each region during network partitions while maintaining the ability to create a consistent global view when possible, balancing availability against consistency

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable in simulated multi-region environments
- Tests must verify correct behavior during network partitions and latency spikes
- Conflict resolution mechanisms must be verified with deterministic scenario testing
- Exactly-once processing guarantees must be validated across failure scenarios
- Migration capabilities must be tested with various state sizes and throughput conditions

### Performance Expectations
- State synchronization with less than 500ms latency between regions under normal conditions
- Throughput degradation during region isolation not exceeding 25% of normal capacity
- Recovery time after partition healing proportional to outage duration with defined bounds
- Processing latency increase due to exactly-once guarantees not exceeding 10% overhead
- Migration operations completing within 2 minutes for standard state sizes

### Integration Points
- Interfaces with global network infrastructure and monitoring systems
- Integration with cloud provider region-specific services
- Connectivity with distributed data storage systems
- Interfaces for global service discovery and health checking
- APIs for management and observability platforms

### Key Constraints
- System must continue functioning during regional isolations
- Global consistency must be restored automatically after connectivity restoration
- Resource utilization must be balanced across available regions
- Data sovereignty and residency requirements must be respected across regions
- System must operate within defined latency budgets despite geographic distribution

## Core Functionality
The implementation must provide a framework for creating globally distributed processing pipelines that can:

1. Process data streams across multiple geographic regions with state synchronization
2. Ensure exactly-once processing semantics across the distributed infrastructure
3. Maintain operation during regional network partitions and infrastructure failures
4. Migrate processing responsibilities dynamically between regions based on load and health
5. Propagate backpressure signals across regional boundaries to manage end-to-end flow
6. Resolve conflicts that arise during concurrent updates across isolated regions
7. Provide region-specific processing with global result aggregation
8. Monitor and report on the health and performance of the distributed system
9. Recover automatically from temporary failures and network partitions
10. Maintain data consistency across regions with configurable consistency models

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct synchronization of state across multiple regions
- Proper handling of exactly-once processing guarantees
- Successful migration of pipeline segments between regions
- Effective propagation of backpressure across regional boundaries
- Appropriate isolation and aggregation of regional processing

### Critical User Scenarios
- Processing continuity during simulated network partition between regions
- Recovery and reconciliation after connectivity restoration
- Handling of concurrent updates to the same state from different regions
- Dynamic rebalancing of processing load across available regions

### Performance Benchmarks
- End-to-end processing latency across regions
- State synchronization overhead and consistency delay
- Throughput capacity during normal operation and regional isolation
- Resource utilization balance across regions
- Recovery time after various failure scenarios

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of "split-brain" scenarios during prolonged network partitions
- Behavior during intermittent connectivity between regions
- Response to complete failure of one or more regions
- Recovery from corrupted or inconsistent state between regions
- Handling of network asymmetry (region A can reach B but not vice versa)

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of all synchronization and conflict resolution logic
- Comprehensive testing of partition scenarios between all region pairs
- Performance testing under various network conditions and load patterns
- Verification of exactly-once guarantees through deterministic fault injection
