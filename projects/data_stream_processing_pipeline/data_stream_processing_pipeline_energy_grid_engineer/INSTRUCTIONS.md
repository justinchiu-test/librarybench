## Overview
A specialized data stream processing framework for monitoring and optimizing power distribution networks using real-time sensor data from smart grid infrastructure. The system forecasts energy demand and supply patterns while enabling dynamic grid operations in response to changing conditions, with a focus on integrating renewable energy sources.

## Persona Description
Marcus monitors power distribution networks using sensor data from smart grid infrastructure to balance load and integrate renewable sources. His primary goal is to forecast energy demand and supply patterns while optimizing grid operations in response to changing conditions.
