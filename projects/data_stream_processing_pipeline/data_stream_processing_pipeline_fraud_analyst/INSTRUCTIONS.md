# Real-time Payment Fraud Detection System

## Overview
A specialized data stream processing framework designed to analyze payment transactions in real-time, correlate events across multiple data streams, and identify potentially fraudulent activities with high accuracy and minimal false positives. The system continuously learns from analyst feedback to improve detection patterns.

## Persona Description
Priya develops fraud detection systems that analyze payment transactions as they occur to identify suspicious patterns. Her primary goal is to correlate events across multiple data streams and quickly flag potentially fraudulent activities with minimal false positives.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-stream correlation with flexible joining conditions**
   - Advanced stream joining capabilities to connect related events across different data sources
   - Critical for Priya to establish comprehensive transaction context by linking customer behaviors, payment details, and historical patterns
   - Must support temporal, attribute-based, and probabilistic join conditions with configurable matching thresholds

2. **Adaptive rule engine that learns from analyst feedback**
   - Self-improving rule system that refines detection patterns based on confirmed fraud cases
   - Essential for continuously improving detection accuracy and adapting to evolving fraud techniques
   - Should include feedback capture mechanisms and automated rule optimization algorithms

3. **Risk scoring framework with explainable decision factors**
   - Comprehensive scoring system that provides clear explanations for fraud risk assessments
   - Vital for enabling analysts to quickly evaluate alerts and make informed decisions
   - Must include detailed factor breakdown and confidence metrics for each risk element

4. **Historical context integration for establishing behavioral baselines**
   - Context enrichment system that incorporates historical patterns into real-time analysis
   - Necessary for detecting deviations from normal behavior that indicate potential fraud
   - Should include customizable behavioral modeling for different customer segments

5. **Case management system for tracking investigation outcomes**
   - Structured workflow for managing flagged transactions through the investigation lifecycle
   - Crucial for maintaining investigation continuity and capturing resolution outcomes for system learning
   - Must include case prioritization, annotation capabilities, and outcome recording

   - Explainable AI components for decision transparency
   - Confidence scoring for risk assessments
   - Threshold management for alert generation

4. **Behavioral Context Platform**
   - Customer behavior profiling and segmentation
   - Historical pattern analysis and baseline establishment
   - Real-time deviation detection
   - Progressive profile refinement

5. **Case Management System**
   - Case creation and tracking workflow
   - Investigation notes and evidence collection
   - Resolution outcome recording
   - Feedback loop to rule adaptation system

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correlation accuracy across different data streams
- Rule adaptation effectiveness over time
