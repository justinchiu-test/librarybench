# Transaction Fraud Detection Pipeline

## Overview
A real-time data stream processing framework specifically designed for detecting fraudulent activities in payment transactions as they occur. The system correlates events across multiple data streams to identify suspicious patterns with high accuracy and low false positive rates, enabling immediate intervention in potential fraud scenarios.

## Persona Description
Priya develops fraud detection systems that analyze payment transactions as they occur to identify suspicious patterns. Her primary goal is to correlate events across multiple data streams and quickly flag potentially fraudulent activities with minimal false positives.

## Key Requirements
1. **Multi-stream correlation with flexible joining conditions**
   - Implement powerful stream joining capabilities using configurable conditions and match windows
   - Support temporal, spatial, and attribute-based correlation across streams
   - Provide utilities for defining complex join patterns involving multiple streams
   - Include performance optimizations for high-volume stream joins
   - This feature is critical for detecting fraud that spans multiple channels, accounts, or transaction types by connecting related events that may individually appear legitimate but together reveal suspicious patterns

2. **Adaptive rule engine that learns from analyst feedback**
   - Implement a rules execution engine with feedback-driven parameter adjustment
   - Support automatic rule performance tracking with statistical analysis
   - Provide interfaces for analyst feedback and rule refinement
   - Include mechanisms for A/B testing rule modifications
   - This capability ensures the fraud detection system continuously improves based on confirmed true and false positives, adapting to evolving fraud tactics without requiring complete rule rewrites

3. **Risk scoring framework with explainable decision factors**
   - Implement a compositional risk scoring system with weighted factors
   - Support drill-down capabilities into score composition
   - Provide utilities for score threshold optimization
   - Include impact analysis for scoring parameter changes
   - This feature provides transparency into why transactions are flagged as suspicious, helping analysts quickly evaluate alerts and make informed decisions about further action

4. **Historical context integration for establishing behavioral baselines**
   - Implement efficient retrieval and summarization of historical transaction patterns
   - Support customer-specific and market-segment baselines
   - Provide capabilities for detecting deviations from established patterns
   - Include mechanisms for baseline recalibration as behaviors evolve
   - This capability enables the system to understand what constitutes "normal" behavior for each customer or account, significantly improving detection accuracy by focusing on anomalous deviations

5. **Case management system for tracking investigation outcomes**
   - Implement data structures for case lifecycle tracking
   - Support bidirectional integration between detection results and investigation outcomes
   - Provide utilities for case prioritization and assignment
   - Include analytical capabilities for investigation outcome analysis
   - This feature creates a feedback loop that improves system performance by tracking which flagged transactions are confirmed fraudulent, helping refine detection algorithms and measure effectiveness

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with simulated transaction streams
- Rules and scoring algorithms must be verifiable with documented test cases
- Historical context integration must be testable with synthetic customer histories
- Test data must represent diverse fraud patterns and legitimate transaction scenarios
- Tests must validate both detection accuracy and performance under load

### Performance Expectations
- Process transactions with end-to-end latency under 100 milliseconds (95th percentile)
- Support sustained throughput of at least 10,000 transactions per second per node
- Maintain low false positive rate (< 0.1%) while achieving high detection rate (> 90%)
- Support historical lookback patterns spanning at least 12 months of transaction history
- Scale horizontally to handle increased transaction volumes during peak periods

### Integration Points
- Connectors for payment processing systems and transaction sources
- APIs for analyst feedback and case management systems
- Interfaces for external data enrichment services
- Integration with reporting and dashboard systems
- Alert dispatching to notification systems

### Key Constraints
- All transaction data must be handled according to financial data security standards
- Personal identifiable information (PII) must be protected in accordance with privacy regulations
- Detection latency must not add significant delay to legitimate transaction processing
- System must handle seasonal and event-driven transaction volume spikes
- False positives must be minimized to reduce reviewer workload

## Core Functionality
The implementation must provide a framework for creating fraud detection pipelines that can:

1. Ingest transaction data from multiple sources with precise timestamping
2. Enrich transactions with relevant context from external systems
3. Apply rule-based and statistical analysis to identify potentially fraudulent activity
4. Correlate events across multiple data streams to detect complex fraud patterns
5. Score transactions based on risk factors with clear decision explanations
6. Incorporate historical behavioral context to establish normal patterns
7. Adapt detection logic based on analyst feedback and investigation outcomes
8. Manage cases through their lifecycle from detection to resolution
9. Provide detailed metrics on detection accuracy and system performance
10. Scale processing capacity in response to transaction volume changes

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate correlation of related events across multiple streams
- Proper risk scoring with explainable factor composition
- Effective adaptation of rules based on feedback
- Appropriate integration of historical behavioral context
- Efficient case management with outcome tracking

### Critical User Scenarios
- Detecting coordinated fraud attacks across multiple accounts
- Identifying anomalous transactions based on customer history
- Adapting to new fraud patterns after rule refinement
- Processing holiday season transaction volume spikes
- Investigating and resolving flagged transaction cases

### Performance Benchmarks
- Transaction processing latency under various load conditions
- Detection accuracy metrics (true positives, false positives, etc.)
- Throughput capacity with different correlation complexity
- Rule adaptation effectiveness over simulated time
- Resource utilization efficiency during volume spikes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of incomplete or corrupted transaction data
- Behavior during sudden transaction volume surges
- Recovery from processing node failures
- Response to conflicting or ambiguous correlation patterns
- Management of extremely complex fraud scenarios

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of all risk scoring and rule execution logic
- Comprehensive testing with diverse transaction patterns and fraud scenarios
- Performance testing across the full range of expected transaction volumes
- Validation of adaptation logic with simulated feedback cycles
- Testing of all supported correlation patterns and joining conditions

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrable detection of complex fraud patterns across multiple data streams
- Successful adaptation of detection rules based on simulated analyst feedback
- Clear explanation of risk factors contributing to transaction scores
- Effective integration of historical context for establishing behavioral baselines
- Efficient case management with traceable investigation outcomes
- Processing performance meeting latency and throughput requirements
