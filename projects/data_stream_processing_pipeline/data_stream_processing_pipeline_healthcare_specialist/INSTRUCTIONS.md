# Patient Vital Signs Monitoring System

## Overview
A specialized healthcare data processing framework for analyzing vital sign streams from medical devices in both hospital and remote settings. This system ensures reliable delivery of critical patient data while detecting medically significant events that require intervention, with strict adherence to healthcare compliance and privacy standards.

## Persona Description
Sophia develops patient monitoring systems that process vital sign data from medical devices in both hospital and remote settings. Her primary goal is to ensure reliable delivery of critical patient data while detecting medically significant events that require intervention.

## Key Requirements

1. **Medical device protocol support with standards compliance**
   - Comprehensive interface framework supporting diverse medical device communication protocols
   - Critical for Sophia to integrate with the wide range of monitoring equipment used in healthcare settings
   - Must adhere to medical device interoperability standards (HL7, FHIR, IEEE 11073) while handling proprietary protocols

2. **Patient-specific baseline calibration and alert thresholds**
   - Personalized monitoring system that establishes individual baselines for each patient
   - Essential for detecting significant deviations that consider a patient's unique medical conditions and history
   - Should include automated baseline calculation with clinician adjustment capabilities

3. **Signal quality assessment with artifact rejection**
   - Intelligent signal processing that distinguishes between true physiological events and monitoring artifacts
   - Vital for maintaining data integrity and reducing false alarms that lead to alert fatigue
   - Must include multiple artifact detection methods optimized for different vital sign types

4. **Medical event pattern recognition with severity classification**
   - Advanced pattern detection system that identifies clinically significant events from vital sign combinations
   - Necessary for early detection of patient deterioration and prioritization of alerts by urgency
   - Should include multi-parameter correlation and progressive severity classification

5. **Compliance-focused audit logging with privacy controls**
   - Comprehensive auditing system that tracks all data access and system actions
   - Crucial for meeting regulatory requirements while protecting sensitive patient information
   - Must include role-based access controls and privacy-preserving data handling mechanisms

   - Signal quality scoring and validation
   - Missing data handling and interpolation
   - Multi-signal correlation analysis

4. **Clinical Event Detection**
   - Pattern recognition across multiple vital signs
   - Event classification by medical significance
   - Severity assessment and prioritization
   - Temporal trend analysis for deterioration
   - Rule-based and ML-based detection methods

5. **Compliance and Privacy Framework**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Role-based access control
