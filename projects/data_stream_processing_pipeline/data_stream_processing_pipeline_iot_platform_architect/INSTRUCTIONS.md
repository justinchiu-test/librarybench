   - This feature is essential for integrating with diverse industrial equipment from different manufacturers and eras, each with proprietary protocols and data formats

4. **Batch/stream hybrid processing for different data velocity requirements**
   - Implement unified processing logic for both real-time and batch data
   - Support dynamic switching between processing modes based on data characteristics and system load
   - Provide configuration for velocity-based routing to appropriate processing paths
