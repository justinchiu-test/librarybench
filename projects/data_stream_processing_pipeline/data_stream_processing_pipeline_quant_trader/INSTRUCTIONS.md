# High-Frequency Trading Data Pipeline

## Overview
A low-latency data processing framework specifically designed for quantitative trading systems that need to process market data feeds with microsecond precision. This specialized pipeline focuses on minimizing processing delays while ensuring reliable handling of critical market events, even during periods of extreme market volatility.

## Persona Description
Maya designs algorithmic trading systems that need to process market data feeds with microsecond precision to identify trading opportunities. Her primary goal is to minimize latency in the data pipeline while ensuring no market signals are missed during high-volatility trading periods.

## Key Requirements

1. **Low-latency optimization with processing time guarantees**
   - Implementation of a low-latency processing framework with strict time budgets for each processing stage
   - Critical for Maya's trading algorithms which depend on microsecond-level precision to maintain competitive advantage in markets where timing is everything
   - Must include performance monitoring to detect and report when latency thresholds are exceeded

2. **Priority-based message processing for critical market events**
   - Smart prioritization system that can identify and accelerate processing of market-moving events
   - Essential for reacting to sudden market shifts (earnings announcements, economic data releases, etc.) before competitors
   - Should include configurability to adjust prioritization rules based on current trading strategies

3. **Custom memory management to avoid garbage collection pauses**
   - Specialized memory management system that minimizes or eliminates unpredictable pauses
   - Crucial for maintaining consistent performance during extended trading sessions
   - Must include pre-allocated memory pools and object recycling to reduce allocation overhead

4. **Parallel pattern matching across multiple security feeds**
   - Efficient parallel processing architecture for scanning patterns across correlated securities
   - Enables Maya to identify arbitrage opportunities across related instruments simultaneously
   - Should support custom pattern definition and recognition across multiple data streams

5. **Circuit breaker patterns for handling market volatility events**
   - Automatic detection and handling of extreme market conditions
   - Protects trading systems from making poor decisions during market dislocations
   - Must include configurable thresholds and customizable response strategies
