# High-Performance Market Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
A low-latency data stream processing framework specifically designed for quantitative trading applications, capable of processing market data feeds with microsecond precision to identify trading opportunities in real-time. The system ensures that no market signals are missed during high-volatility trading periods while maintaining minimal processing latency.

## Persona Description
Maya designs algorithmic trading systems that need to process market data feeds with microsecond precision to identify trading opportunities. Her primary goal is to minimize latency in the data pipeline while ensuring no market signals are missed during high-volatility trading periods.

## Key Requirements
1. **Low-latency optimization with processing time guarantees**
   - Implement configurable processing time budgets for pipeline stages
   - Ensure consistent execution times with minimal jitter for critical path operations
   - Provide latency measurement and reporting at nanosecond granularity
   - Support specialized optimizations for CPU cache locality and memory access patterns
   - This feature is critical as milliseconds or even microseconds can mean the difference between profitable and unprofitable trades

2. **Priority-based message processing for critical market events**
   - Support prioritization of data streams based on configurable event types
   - Implement preemptive processing for high-priority market signals
   - Allow dynamic adjustment of priorities based on market conditions
   - Provide mechanisms to prevent starvation of lower-priority events
   - This capability ensures that critical market events (price jumps, liquidity changes) are processed ahead of routine updates

3. **Custom memory management to avoid garbage collection pauses**
   - Implement pre-allocated memory pools for message objects
   - Support zero-copy operations for message passing between pipeline stages
   - Provide configurable buffer sizes optimized for different market data rates
   - Include memory usage statistics and proactive monitoring
   - This feature eliminates unpredictable pauses that would otherwise cause missed trading opportunities

4. **Parallel pattern matching across multiple security feeds**
   - Implement efficient algorithms for cross-asset correlation detection
   - Support template-based pattern matching with configurable parameters
   - Enable parallel execution of multiple pattern detectors
   - Include utilities for calibrating and backtesting patterns
   - This allows for the identification of arbitrage opportunities or market inefficiencies that exist across related securities

5. **Circuit breaker patterns for handling market volatility events**
   - Implement configurable thresholds for detecting extreme market conditions
   - Support graceful degradation of processing during volatility spikes
   - Provide automated recovery mechanisms when normal conditions resume
   - Include logging and alerting for circuit breaker triggers
   - This protects the system from becoming overwhelmed during periods of extraordinary market activity

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All components must support deterministic replay of historical market data for regression testing
- Performance tests must validate microsecond-level latency guarantees under various market conditions
- Test scenarios must include simulation of market volatility events to verify circuit breaker functionality
- Tests must validate correct prioritization of messages during high load scenarios
- Memory usage tests must verify absence of memory leaks and garbage collection pauses

### Performance Expectations
- Maximum processing latency of 50 microseconds for critical market events (99.9th percentile)
- Throughput capacity of at least 1 million market updates per second on standard server hardware
- Less than 0.001% message drop rate during normal operation
- Memory footprint not exceeding predefined limits based on available system resources
- Zero performance degradation over extended periods of continuous operation

### Integration Points
- Support for standard market data formats (FIX, ITCH, OUCH, etc.)
- Connector interfaces for market data providers (exchange direct feeds, consolidated feeds)
- Output adapters for algorithmic trading systems and order management systems
- Monitoring integration with standard observability platforms
- Historical data storage interface for pattern backtest calibration

### Key Constraints
- No dynamic memory allocation in critical processing paths
- No dependencies on third-party libraries with unpredictable performance characteristics
- No reliance on garbage-collected data structures for real-time message processing
- All operations must be thread-safe without requiring coarse-grained locks
- No use of synchronous I/O operations in processing pipelines

## Core Functionality
The implementation must provide a framework for creating high-performance data processing pipelines that can:

1. Ingest multiple market data feeds with precise timestamping
2. Filter, transform, and enrich market data events
3. Detect patterns and correlations across multiple security feeds in real-time
4. Apply priority-based processing to ensure critical events are handled promptly
5. Implement circuit breaker logic to handle extreme market conditions
6. Provide detailed performance metrics for monitoring and optimization
7. Ensure deterministic behavior for reproducible backtesting
8. Manage memory efficiently to avoid garbage collection pauses
9. Allow for modular configuration of pipeline stages
10. Support hot-swapping of processing components without pipeline restarts

### Performance Benchmarks
- End-to-end processing latency for various message types and priorities
- Maximum sustained throughput without message drops
- Memory utilization under normal and peak loads
- CPU utilization across processing cores
- Recovery time after circuit breaker events

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of malformed or corrupt market data
- Behavior during partial feed outages or intermittent connectivity
- Response to extremely high message rates exceeding design parameters
- Recovery from processing stage failures
- Handling of clock drift and timestamp anomalies
