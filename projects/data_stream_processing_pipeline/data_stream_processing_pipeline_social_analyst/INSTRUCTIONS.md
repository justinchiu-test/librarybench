# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Engine

## Overview
A real-time stream processing framework designed to monitor, analyze, and extract insights from social media content across multiple platforms. This system processes unstructured text data at scale, identifies trending topics, and detects sentiment shifts in real-time to support brand management and reputation monitoring.

## Persona Description
Jamal develops systems to monitor social media engagement and sentiment across various platforms for brand management. His primary goal is to process unstructured text data at scale while identifying trending topics and sentiment shifts in real-time.

## Key Requirements

1. **Natural language processing pipeline for sentiment extraction**
   - Comprehensive text processing framework that accurately determines sentiment in social media content
   - Critical for Jamal to understand how customers feel about brands across various platforms and contexts
   - Must support multiple languages, slang, emoticons, and platform-specific content formats

2. **Trend detection algorithms with configurable significance thresholds**
   - Advanced trend identification system that distinguishes meaningful signals from random fluctuations
   - Essential for identifying emerging topics before they become widely discussed
   - Should include configurable significance parameters for different detection sensitivity needs

3. **Platform-specific data enrichment with API rate limiting**
   - Specialized data collection and enhancement for different social media platforms
   - Necessary for maintaining comprehensive monitoring while respecting platform API limitations
   - Must include smart rate limiting, quota management, and request optimization strategies

4. **Entity recognition and relationship mapping across posts**
   - Sophisticated entity extraction and connection analysis across social media content
   - Vital for understanding relationships between brands, people, and topics being discussed
   - Should include relationship strength scoring and temporal evolution tracking

5. **Engagement spike detection with automated alert thresholds**
   - Real-time monitoring system for unusual engagement patterns requiring immediate attention
   - Crucial for identifying potential viral content or emerging reputation issues
   - Must include self-calibrating thresholds based on historical patterns and context

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Test data generation mimicking realistic social media content and patterns
- Sentiment analysis accuracy validation against human-labeled datasets
- Trend detection verification with historical data replays
- Reproducible scenario testing for engagement spike conditions
- Performance testing under viral event conditions

### Performance Expectations

- Alert generation within 30 seconds of threshold breach detection

### Integration Points
- Social media platform APIs (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Brand management and reputation monitoring systems
- Alert and notification infrastructure
- Reporting and visualization dashboards
- Historical data warehousing for long-term analysis

### Key Constraints
- Must respect API rate limits for each social media platform
- Sentiment analysis must achieve at least 85% agreement with human evaluation
- Must support at least 5 major languages with comparable accuracy
- Processing latency must not exceed specified thresholds during viral events
- Privacy and data handling must comply with relevant regulations

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **NLP and Sentiment Analysis System**
   - Text preprocessing and normalization
   - Sentiment analysis with context awareness
   - Emotion classification beyond positive/negative/neutral
   - Multi-language support with consistent accuracy
   - Emoji and slang interpretation

2. **Trend Detection Framework**
   - Real-time topic extraction and clustering
   - Significance scoring based on configurable parameters
   - Baseline establishment and deviation detection
   - Trend lifecycle tracking and evolution
   - Cross-platform trend correlation

3. **Platform Integration Engine**
   - API integration for major social platforms
   - Intelligent rate limit management
   - Request optimization and batching
   - Quota distribution and priority management
   - Adaptive scheduling during API disruptions

4. **Entity Analysis System**
   - Named entity recognition optimized for social content
   - Relationship extraction and graph construction
   - Entity disambiguation and resolution
   - Influence and connection strength scoring
   - Temporal relationship evolution tracking

5. **Engagement Monitoring Framework**
   - Real-time engagement metrics collection
   - Baseline modeling with seasonal adjustments
   - Anomaly detection for unusual activity patterns
   - Alert threshold management and notification
   - Engagement context analysis and categorization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Sentiment analysis accuracy across different content types
- Trend detection sensitivity and specificity
- API rate limit compliance and request optimization
- Entity recognition and relationship mapping correctness
- Engagement spike detection accuracy and alert timeliness

### Critical User Scenarios
- Brand reputation monitoring during product launch
- Crisis management during negative viral events
- Competitive intelligence gathering across platforms
- Campaign performance tracking and optimization
- Influencer identification and relationship mapping

### Performance Benchmarks
- Sentiment analysis accuracy of 85%+ compared to human evaluation
- True positive rate of 90%+ for significant trend detection
- False positive rate below 5% for engagement spike alerts
- Processing throughput of 100,000+ posts per minute
- API quota utilization efficiency of 95%+ across platforms

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of API rate limit exhaustion
- Processing during viral event traffic spikes
- Recovery from platform API outages
- Adaptation to social platform algorithm changes
- Response to novel content types or emerging slang

### Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of text processing components
- Comprehensive testing across all supported languages
- Performance testing across projected peak volumes
- Accuracy testing against diverse content samples
- Extended stability testing under variable load conditions

## Success Criteria
1. The NLP pipeline accurately extracts sentiment from social media content across multiple languages and platforms
2. Trend detection algorithms identify meaningful emerging topics with minimal false positives
3. Platform integration efficiently collects data while respecting API rate limits and optimizing quota usage
4. Entity recognition and relationship mapping correctly identify and connect relevant entities across posts
5. Engagement spike detection promptly alerts to unusual activity patterns requiring attention
6. The system scales to handle viral events without exceeding latency thresholds
7. Analysis results provide actionable insights for brand management and crisis response
