# Social Media Sentiment and Trend Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
A specialized data stream processing framework for monitoring social media engagement and sentiment across multiple platforms in real-time. The system processes large volumes of unstructured text data to extract insights, identify trending topics, and detect significant shifts in brand sentiment.

## Persona Description
Jamal develops systems to monitor social media engagement and sentiment across various platforms for brand management. His primary goal is to process unstructured text data at scale while identifying trending topics and sentiment shifts in real-time.

## Key Requirements
1. **Natural language processing pipeline for sentiment extraction**
   - Implement a configurable NLP pipeline optimized for social media content
   - Support sentiment analysis with fine-grained emotion classification
   - Provide language detection and multilingual processing capabilities
   - Include context-aware sentiment extraction that considers sarcasm and idioms
   - This feature is critical for accurately measuring public perception across different content types and languages, providing brands with meaningful sentiment analysis beyond simple positive/negative classification

2. **Trend detection algorithms with configurable significance thresholds**
   - Implement statistical methods for identifying emerging topics and unusual activity
   - Support temporal trend analysis with various timeframe comparisons
   - Provide significance scoring based on engagement metrics and velocity
   - Include trend classification and categorization capabilities
   - This capability enables the early detection of emerging topics and conversations that may impact brand perception, allowing for proactive response before trends become widespread

3. **Platform-specific data enrichment with API rate limiting**
   - Implement adapters for major social media platforms with proper rate limit handling
   - Support metadata enrichment through platform-specific APIs
   - Provide smart retry and backoff strategies for API limits
   - Include cross-platform identity resolution where possible
   - This feature maximizes the value of social data by augmenting posts with platform-specific context while respecting API limitations, ensuring continuous data flow without triggering rate limit blocks

4. **Entity recognition and relationship mapping across posts**
   - Implement named entity recognition optimized for social media content
   - Support entity relationship extraction and graph construction
   - Provide entity resolution and disambiguation capabilities
   - Include visualization-ready relationship data structures
   - This capability reveals connections between brands, people, products, and topics across the social landscape, enabling deeper understanding of conversations and influence patterns

5. **Engagement spike detection with automated alert thresholds**
   - Implement real-time monitoring for unusual engagement patterns
   - Support baseline learning for normal engagement levels by time and channel
   - Provide configurable alerting with multiple severity levels
   - Include impact prediction based on early engagement signals
   - This feature ensures timely awareness of sudden changes in social media activity related to monitored entities, allowing for immediate response to potential viral situations

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All NLP components must be testable with standardized social media datasets
- Trend detection must be verifiable with historical trend examples
- API integrations must be testable with mock services that simulate rate limits
- Entity recognition must be validated against annotated ground truth datasets
- Alert mechanisms must be testable with simulated engagement spikes

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 10,000 social media posts per second
- Complete sentiment analysis within 500ms per post (95th percentile)
- Detect emerging trends within 5 minutes of onset
- Update entity relationship graphs in near real-time
- Generate alerts within 2 minutes of engagement anomalies

### Integration Points
- Connectors for major social media platform APIs
- Integration with enterprise notification systems
- APIs for visualization dashboards and reporting tools
- Webhook support for triggering automated responses
- Data export capabilities for deeper analysis

### Key Constraints
- All processing must respect platform API rate limits
- System must handle irregular and unpredictable traffic spikes
- Text processing must adapt to evolving social media language patterns
- Analysis must accommodate platform-specific content formats and features
- Performance must scale with the number of monitored topics and entities

## Core Functionality
The implementation must provide a framework for creating social media analytics pipelines that can:

1. Ingest social media content from multiple platforms with appropriate rate limiting
2. Process unstructured text to extract sentiment, entities, and topics
3. Detect emerging trends and conversation shifts in real-time
4. Enrich content with platform-specific metadata and context
5. Map relationships between entities mentioned across the social landscape
6. Monitor engagement metrics for unusual activity patterns
7. Generate alerts for significant sentiment shifts and engagement spikes
8. Provide detailed analysis data for dashboard visualization
9. Adapt to evolving language patterns and platform changes
10. Scale processing capacity to handle viral events and traffic surges

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate sentiment extraction from diverse social media content
- Effective trend detection with appropriate significance thresholds
- Proper handling of platform API rate limits during data enrichment
- Correct entity recognition and relationship mapping
- Reliable engagement spike detection with minimal false alarms

### Critical User Scenarios
- Monitoring sentiment during a brand crisis situation
- Identifying emerging trends relevant to a specific industry
- Tracking entity relationships in a complex conversation landscape
- Detecting unusual engagement patterns before they become viral
- Analyzing sentiment across multiple languages and markets

### Performance Benchmarks
- Processing throughput under various content volume scenarios
- Sentiment analysis accuracy against human-annotated test sets
- Trend detection speed and precision metrics
- API utilization efficiency while respecting rate limits
- Memory and CPU usage during viral event simulation

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of platform API outages or quota exhaustion
- Behavior during sudden viral events with exponential traffic growth
- Response to evolving language patterns and new social media conventions
- Processing of multilingual content with mixed languages
- Management of malformed or non-standard content formats

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95%+ coverage of all text processing and sentiment analysis logic
- Comprehensive testing with diverse content samples across platforms
- Performance testing across the full range of expected traffic patterns
- Validation of trend detection against known historical events
- Testing of entity recognition with challenging edge cases

## Success Criteria
