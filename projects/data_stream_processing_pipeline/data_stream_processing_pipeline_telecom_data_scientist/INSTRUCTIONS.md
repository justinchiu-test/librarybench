# Telecommunications Network Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
A specialized data stream processing framework for analyzing telecommunications network traffic and call detail records in real-time. The system applies advanced statistical analysis on high-volume data streams to detect network anomalies, optimize infrastructure, and monitor service quality metrics against defined SLAs.

## Persona Description
Emma analyzes call detail records and network traffic data to optimize telecommunications infrastructure and detect service anomalies. Her primary goal is to perform complex statistical analysis on high-volume data streams while identifying network issues in real-time.

## Key Requirements
1. **Sliding window analysis with configurable decay functions**
   - Implement time-based and count-based sliding window operations with customizable sizes
   - Support multiple decay functions (linear, exponential, custom) for time-weighted analysis
   - Provide windowing utilities optimized for telecommunications metrics
   - Include memory-efficient implementations for high-cardinality dimension analysis
   - This feature is critical for detecting time-dependent patterns in network traffic, such as gradual degradations or cyclical load patterns, by giving appropriate weight to more recent events while retaining historical context

2. **Topology-aware data routing matching network structure**
   - Implement data routing logic that mirrors telecommunications network topology
   - Support dynamic topology updates as network equipment changes
   - Provide visualization-ready topology mapping capabilities
   - Include correlation of metrics across connected network elements
   - This capability ensures that data processing flows match the actual structure of the telecommunications network, enabling hierarchical aggregation and drill-down analysis that respects the physical and logical relationships between network elements

3. **Anomaly detection algorithms with self-tuning thresholds**
   - Implement multiple statistical anomaly detection methods appropriate for telecom metrics
   - Support automatic baseline calculation and threshold adjustment
   - Provide anomaly classification and prioritization mechanisms
   - Include utilities for false positive management and threshold refinement
   - This feature enables automatic detection of network issues before they impact service quality by establishing normal behavior patterns for each network element and identifying significant deviations, with thresholds that automatically adapt to changing network conditions

4. **Multi-dimensional data cube construction for interactive analysis**
   - Implement online analytical processing (OLAP) cube construction from streaming data
   - Support drill-down, roll-up, slice, and dice operations on live data
   - Provide memory-efficient sparse cube implementations
   - Include incremental cube update mechanisms
   - This capability allows for real-time multi-dimensional analysis of network performance across various attributes (time, geography, service type, etc.), enabling interactive exploration of data to identify patterns and correlations across dimensions

5. **Service quality metric extraction with SLA threshold monitoring**
   - Implement calculation engines for key telecommunications quality metrics
   - Support configurable SLA definitions with multiple threshold levels
   - Provide automated alerting on SLA violations with escalation paths
   - Include trend analysis for pre-emptive SLA violation prevention
   - This feature automatically monitors service quality against defined service level agreements, enabling proactive intervention before customer experience is impacted and providing compliance reporting for regulatory and contractual requirements
