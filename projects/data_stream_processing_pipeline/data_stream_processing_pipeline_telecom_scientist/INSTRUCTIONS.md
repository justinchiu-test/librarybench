# Telecommunications Network Analytics Platform

## Overview
A specialized stream processing framework designed for analyzing high-volume telecommunications data, including call detail records and network traffic metrics. This platform enables complex statistical analysis in real-time while detecting network anomalies and service degradations with high precision.

## Persona Description
Emma analyzes call detail records and network traffic data to optimize telecommunications infrastructure and detect service anomalies. Her primary goal is to perform complex statistical analysis on high-volume data streams while identifying network issues in real-time.
