# Autonomous Vehicle Testing Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for autonomous vehicle engineers to test self-driving systems against thousands of edge cases. This framework focuses on realistic sensor simulation, edge case generation, distributed parameter testing, failure mode identification, and hardware-in-the-loop integration for comprehensive autonomous driving validation.

## Persona Description
Carlos develops self-driving systems that require extensive simulation before road testing. His primary goal is to create realistic virtual environments to test autonomous driving algorithms against thousands of edge cases and traffic scenarios that would be dangerous or impossible to test on real roads.

## Key Requirements

1. **Sensor Simulation with Realistic Physics and Noise Models**  
   Implement high-fidelity simulations of various sensor types (cameras, lidar, radar, ultrasonic) with accurate physics-based behavior and realistic noise characteristics. This is critical for Carlos because autonomous vehicles rely entirely on sensor data for perception, and testing with idealized sensors would fail to reveal vulnerabilities that emerge under real-world sensing conditions.

2. **Edge Case Generation with Combinatorial Scenario Creation**  
   Develop capabilities to systematically generate challenging edge cases by combinatorially varying environmental conditions, traffic behaviors, and sensor degradations. This feature is essential because autonomous vehicles must handle rare but critical scenarios safely, and systematic generation of these edge cases enables comprehensive testing that would be impossible to achieve with road testing alone.

3. **Distributed Testing Across Parameter Space**  
   Create a framework for efficiently distributing autonomous driving tests across a multi-dimensional parameter space, utilizing parallel processing to explore the vast testing space. This capability is crucial for Carlos because the parameter space for autonomous driving is enormous, requiring systematic exploration to identify failure conditions without exhausting computational resources.

4. **Failure Mode Identification and Categorization**  
   Implement algorithms that can automatically detect, classify, and prioritize failure modes in autonomous driving systems based on simulation outcomes. This feature is vital for Carlos's work because manually reviewing thousands of simulation results would be prohibitively time-consuming, and automated identification helps focus engineering efforts on the most critical safety issues.

5. **Hardware-in-the-Loop Integration for Control Systems**  
   Develop interfaces that allow physical control hardware to interact with the simulation environment, enabling testing of actual autonomous driving hardware components with simulated sensors and environments. This integration is essential for Carlos because it bridges the gap between pure software simulation and road testing, revealing integration issues and control response characteristics that might not appear in software-only testing.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
