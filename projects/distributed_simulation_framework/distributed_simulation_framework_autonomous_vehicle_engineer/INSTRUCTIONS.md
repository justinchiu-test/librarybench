# Autonomous Vehicle Testing Framework

## Overview
A specialized distributed simulation framework designed for autonomous vehicle engineers to thoroughly test self-driving systems in virtual environments. This framework enables realistic sensor simulation, systematic edge case generation, distributed testing across parameter spaces, failure mode identification, and hardware-in-the-loop integration for comprehensive validation before real-world deployment.

## Persona Description
Carlos develops self-driving systems that require extensive simulation before road testing. His primary goal is to create realistic virtual environments to test autonomous driving algorithms against thousands of edge cases and traffic scenarios that would be dangerous or impossible to test on real roads.

## Key Requirements

1. **Sensor Simulation with Realistic Physics and Noise Models**
   - Simulate various sensor types (cameras, LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic, GPS, IMU)
   - Model sensor physics including environmental effects (weather, lighting, occlusion)
   - Implement realistic noise models calibrated against real sensor data
   - Support for sensor fusion algorithm testing with synchronized multi-sensor output
   - Critical for Carlos because autonomous vehicles rely on sensor data for perception, and algorithms must be robust to real-world sensor limitations, noise, and environmental interference, requiring high-fidelity simulation to validate perception systems before deployment

2. **Edge Case Generation with Combinatorial Scenario Creation**
   - Automatically generate unusual and challenging traffic scenarios
   - Combinatorial testing of environmental conditions and traffic participant behaviors
   - Parameterized scenario templates for systematic coverage
   - Prioritization of high-risk or previously problematic scenarios
   - Critical for Carlos because autonomous vehicles must handle rare but dangerous situations safely, and manually designing all possible edge cases is impossible, requiring automated generation techniques to discover potential failure modes systematically

3. **Distributed Testing Across Parameter Space**
   - Parallelize testing across multiple simulation instances
   - Systematic exploration of algorithm and scenario parameter spaces
   - Hyperparameter optimization for perception and decision algorithms
   - Efficient allocation of computational resources based on scenario complexity
   - Critical for Carlos because autonomous driving systems have numerous parameters affecting performance, and comprehensive testing requires exploring vast parameter spaces that would be prohibitively time-consuming without distributed computation

4. **Failure Mode Identification and Categorization**
   - Automatically detect and classify system failures during simulation
   - Root cause analysis to identify contributing factors
   - Severity classification based on safety implications
   - Regression testing to verify issue resolution
   - Critical for Carlos because understanding why and how autonomous systems fail is essential for improving their safety and reliability, and automated classification helps prioritize issues and track progress toward resolution

5. **Hardware-in-the-Loop Integration for Control Systems**
   - Interface with physical control hardware during simulation
   - Real-time simulation capabilities for hardware synchronization
   - Latency and timing analysis for control systems
   - Graceful degradation testing under hardware constraints
   - Critical for Carlos because autonomous vehicle control algorithms ultimately run on specialized hardware with timing constraints, and hardware-in-the-loop testing ensures the software performs correctly on actual deployment hardware before road testing
