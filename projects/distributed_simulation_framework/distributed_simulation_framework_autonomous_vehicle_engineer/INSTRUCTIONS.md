# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation Testing Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for autonomous vehicle developers to safely test self-driving systems against thousands of edge cases and challenging scenarios. The framework enables comprehensive virtual testing of autonomous driving algorithms in environments that would be dangerous, impractical, or impossible to recreate in real-world testing.

## Persona Description
Carlos develops self-driving systems that require extensive simulation before road testing. His primary goal is to create realistic virtual environments to test autonomous driving algorithms against thousands of edge cases and traffic scenarios that would be dangerous or impossible to test on real roads.

## Key Requirements

1. **Sensor Simulation with Realistic Physics and Noise Models**  
   Implement a comprehensive sensor simulation module that accurately models various autonomous vehicle sensors (cameras, LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic) with appropriate physics-based behaviors and realistic noise characteristics. This is critical for Carlos because sensor interpretation is a fundamental part of autonomous driving systems, and the ability to accurately simulate sensor imperfections ensures the testing environment reflects real-world conditions.

2. **Edge Case Generation with Combinatorial Scenario Creation**  
   Develop a system for procedurally generating and managing thousands of edge case scenarios through combinatorial approaches of environmental factors, traffic behaviors, and unexpected events. This feature is essential because autonomous vehicles must be tested against rare but critical scenarios that are difficult to encounter in normal road testing but could lead to safety-critical failures if not properly handled.

3. **Distributed Testing Across Parameter Space**  
   Create a parameter space exploration framework that efficiently distributes simulation workloads across computing resources, enabling parallel testing of autonomous systems across various configurations and scenarios. This functionality allows Carlos to comprehensively test autonomous systems across the full parameter space in a time-efficient manner, ensuring thorough validation before deploying to real vehicles.

4. **Failure Mode Identification and Categorization**  
   Build an automated analysis system that identifies, classifies, and catalogs simulation runs where the autonomous system fails or performs sub-optimally, providing contextual information about failure conditions. This capability enables Carlos to systematically address weaknesses in the autonomous driving algorithms by understanding patterns in failure scenarios and prioritizing improvements.

5. **Hardware-in-the-Loop Integration for Control Systems**  
   Implement interfaces for integrating actual vehicle control hardware into the simulation loop, allowing real ECUs and control systems to interact with the virtual environment. This feature is vital because it allows testing the exact hardware components that will be deployed in production vehicles, verifying their behavior when connected to the full autonomous system in challenging scenarios.

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report

  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

```

The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass and is a critical requirement for project completion.
