# Multi-Domain Climate Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework designed specifically for climate scientists to model complex climate systems across multiple physical domains. This framework excels at integrating atmospheric, oceanic, and land components operating at different timescales while efficiently distributing computation across heterogeneous computing resources.

## Persona Description
Dr. Zhang models regional climate systems to predict environmental changes and evaluate mitigation strategies. His primary goal is to run high-resolution climate simulations that integrate atmospheric, oceanic, and land components while maximizing computational efficiency.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Physics Domain Integration with Different Timescales**  
   Implement a system that coordinates the simulation of different physical domains (atmosphere, ocean, land, ice) operating at their native timescales while maintaining physical consistency at their interfaces. This is critical for Dr. Zhang because accurate climate modeling requires representing processes that naturally operate at widely different rates (from hours for atmospheric phenomena to centuries for deep ocean circulation) while preserving their complex interactions.

2. **Uncertainty Quantification through Ensemble Simulations**  
   Develop capabilities to efficiently run and analyze large ensembles of simulations with varied initial conditions and parameters to quantify prediction uncertainty. This feature is essential because climate predictions inherently contain uncertainties, and Dr. Zhang needs to provide statistical confidence measures with his climate projections to support evidence-based policy decisions.

3. **Downscaling Capabilities for Regional Impact Assessment**  
   Create mechanisms to translate global-scale climate simulation results to high-resolution regional predictions that capture local topographic and environmental factors. This capability is crucial for Dr. Zhang because while global climate models provide broad trends, stakeholders need location-specific predictions to develop targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies for their regions.

4. **Long-Running Simulation Management with Incremental Results**  
   Implement a framework for managing simulations that run for weeks or months of computation time, with checkpointing, restart capabilities, and incremental result output. This feature is vital for Dr. Zhang's work because climate simulations often model decades or centuries of climate evolution, requiring computation that far exceeds continuous runtime possibilities.

5. **Computation Distribution Optimized for Heterogeneous Clusters**  
   Develop a system that efficiently distributes simulation workloads across computing resources with different capabilities (CPU/GPU/specialized hardware) while maintaining load balance. This integration is essential for Dr. Zhang because climate research centers typically have heterogeneous computing environments, and maximizing resource utilization is necessary for running high-resolution simulations within practical timeframes.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
