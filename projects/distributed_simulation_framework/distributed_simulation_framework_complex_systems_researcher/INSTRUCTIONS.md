# Emergent Behavior Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework designed specifically for complex systems researchers to model and analyze emergent behaviors in large-scale biological systems. The framework enables the simulation of millions of interacting agents with dynamic parameter adjustment capabilities and specialized tools for identifying and analyzing emergent patterns.

## Persona Description
Dr. Anya studies emergent behaviors in large-scale biological systems requiring simulation of millions of interacting agents. Her primary goal is to run massive-scale simulations that reveal emergent patterns while allowing her to dynamically adjust parameters as interesting behaviors appear.

## Key Requirements

1. **Interactive Parameter Adjustment During Running Simulations**  
   Implement a mechanism for modifying simulation parameters in real-time without restarting the simulation while maintaining system consistency. This capability is critical for Dr. Anya because complex systems often exhibit unexpected emergent behaviors that warrant immediate exploration through parameter adjustments, allowing her to follow interesting phenomena as they develop rather than having to restart simulations repeatedly.

2. **Pattern Detection Algorithms that Identify Emergent Behaviors**  
   Develop advanced algorithmic methods for automatically identifying, classifying, and tracking emergent patterns and behaviors within the simulation data streams. This feature is essential because manual identification of emergent phenomena in massive agent-based simulations is prohibitively time-consuming, and automated detection allows Dr. Anya to focus her analysis on scientifically significant emergent behaviors.

3. **Hierarchical Simulation Decomposition Based on Agent Proximity**  
   Create a multi-level spatial decomposition system that dynamically assigns computational resources based on agent proximity and interaction density. This approach is crucial for Dr. Anya's work because biological systems often have regions of varying agent density and interaction frequency, and allocating computational resources proportionally to interaction complexity dramatically improves simulation performance for large-scale models.

4. **Specialized Visualization for Multi-Scale Phenomena**  
   Build data transformation and representation modules that enable visualization of emergent behaviors across multiple scales simultaneously. This capability is vital because biological phenomena often emerge from interactions spanning multiple scales (molecular to cellular to tissue to organism), and Dr. Anya needs to analyze how microscopic interactions lead to macroscopic emergent behaviors.

5. **Scientific Workflow Integration with Experiment Tracking**  
   Implement comprehensive experiment tracking, provenance capture, and reproducibility mechanisms that integrate with scientific workflow systems. This functionality is important because complex systems research requires methodical experimentation with careful tracking of simulation parameters, conditions, and results to ensure scientific validity and reproducibility of findings.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All simulation components must support deterministic execution modes for testing
- Pattern detection algorithms must be validatable against synthetic datasets with known patterns

### Performance Expectations
- Must scale efficiently to simulate at least 10 million interacting agents

### Integration Points
- API for defining custom agent behaviors and interaction rules

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report

  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
