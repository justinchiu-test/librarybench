# Emergent Behavior Analysis Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for complex systems researchers that enables the simulation of millions of interacting agents to reveal emergent patterns. This framework focuses on interactive parameter adjustment during simulations, pattern detection algorithms, hierarchical agent decomposition, and specialized visualization for analyzing multi-scale emergent phenomena.

## Persona Description
Dr. Anya studies emergent behaviors in large-scale biological systems requiring simulation of millions of interacting agents. Her primary goal is to run massive-scale simulations that reveal emergent patterns while allowing her to dynamically adjust parameters as interesting behaviors appear.

## Key Requirements

1. **Interactive Parameter Adjustment During Running Simulations**  
   Implement a mechanism that allows researchers to modify simulation parameters while the simulation is actively running without requiring a restart. This is critical for Dr. Anya's work as it enables her to respond to emerging patterns by testing different parameter values in real-time, reducing the iteration cycle and accelerating scientific discovery.

2. **Pattern Detection Algorithms for Emergent Behaviors**  
   Develop algorithms that automatically identify and classify emergent patterns and behaviors within the simulation. This feature is essential because it helps Dr. Anya discover unexpected emergent phenomena that might otherwise be missed in complex simulations with millions of agents, providing insights into self-organizing biological systems.

3. **Hierarchical Simulation Decomposition Based on Agent Proximity**  
   Create a simulation partitioning system that dynamically groups agents based on their spatial or logical proximity, applying different levels of detail at different scales. This capability is crucial for Dr. Anya's research because it allows efficient simulation of biological systems that exhibit naturally hierarchical organization, such as cells forming tissues forming organs forming organisms.

4. **Specialized Visualization for Multi-Scale Phenomena**  
   Implement visualization capabilities that can represent emergent behaviors across multiple scales simultaneously, allowing researchers to observe both micro and macro patterns. This feature is vital for Dr. Anya because it enables her to connect low-level agent interactions to high-level system behaviors, revealing the causal mechanisms behind emergent phenomena.

5. **Scientific Workflow Integration with Experiment Tracking**  
   Develop a system to track simulation experiments, record parameter values, capture result metrics, and maintain provenance of findings. This integration is essential for Dr. Anya's scientific process as it ensures reproducibility of results, enables methodical exploration of parameter spaces, and facilitates collaboration with other researchers.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
