# Pandemic Response Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for epidemiological researchers to model disease spread across diverse populations and evaluate intervention strategies. This framework excels at multi-region modeling, intervention testing, healthcare resource forecasting, behavioral adaptation simulation, and policy effectiveness comparison with statistical confidence measures.

## Persona Description
Dr. Okafor models disease spread through populations to evaluate intervention strategies and resource allocation. His primary goal is to simulate pandemic scenarios across diverse geographic and demographic contexts while incorporating realistic human behavior patterns.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Region Simulation with Travel and Contact Patterns**  
   Implement a system that models disease transmission across multiple geographic regions with realistic human movement and contact patterns between them. This is critical for Dr. Okafor because infectious disease spread is fundamentally shaped by population mobility and social networks that cross regional boundaries, requiring models that capture these interconnections to accurately predict pandemic trajectories.

2. **Intervention Strategy Testing with Timing Optimization**  
   Develop capabilities to model various pandemic interventions (lockdowns, vaccination campaigns, mask mandates) with the ability to optimize their timing, intensity, and targeting. This feature is essential because Dr. Okafor needs to provide evidence-based recommendations to public health officials about which interventions will be most effective and when they should be implemented for maximum impact.

3. **Healthcare Resource Utilization Forecasting**  
   Create mechanisms for translating disease spread projections into forecasts of healthcare resource needs (hospital beds, ICU capacity, ventilators, staff) across different facilities and regions. This capability is crucial for Dr. Okafor because healthcare system capacity is a critical constraint during pandemics, and accurate resource forecasting enables better preparation and allocation decisions.

4. **Behavioral Adaptation Models for Population Response**  
   Implement realistic modeling of how human behavior changes in response to disease prevalence, public health messaging, and intervention policies. This feature is vital for Dr. Okafor's research because population compliance and behavioral adaptations significantly affect intervention effectiveness, and models without these factors often fail to predict real-world outcomes.

5. **Policy Effectiveness Comparison with Confidence Intervals**  
   Develop statistical tools to compare different intervention policies and quantify uncertainty in their predicted outcomes. This integration is essential for Dr. Okafor because policymakers need clear comparisons between alternative approaches with appropriate confidence measures to make informed decisions under uncertainty.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
