# Pandemic Simulation and Intervention Analysis Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework specialized for epidemiologists to model disease spread across diverse populations and geographic regions. The framework enables comprehensive pandemic scenario modeling with capabilities for testing intervention strategies, forecasting healthcare resource utilization, and incorporating realistic human behavior patterns.

## Persona Description
Dr. Okafor models disease spread through populations to evaluate intervention strategies and resource allocation. His primary goal is to simulate pandemic scenarios across diverse geographic and demographic contexts while incorporating realistic human behavior patterns.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Region Simulation with Travel and Contact Patterns**  
   Implement a system for modeling disease transmission across multiple interconnected regions with realistic population movement and contact networks. This capability is critical for Dr. Okafor because infectious diseases spread through human mobility networks, and accurate modeling of inter-regional travel and local contact patterns is essential for predicting disease spread trajectories across diverse geographic and demographic contexts.

2. **Intervention Strategy Testing with Timing Optimization**  
   Develop capabilities for defining, implementing, and evaluating various intervention strategies (e.g., vaccination campaigns, quarantine measures, travel restrictions) with tools for optimizing implementation timing. This feature is vital because public health officials need evidence-based guidance on which interventions to deploy and when to implement them for maximum effectiveness, helping Dr. Okafor provide actionable recommendations that balance health outcomes with societal impacts.

3. **Healthcare Resource Utilization Forecasting**  
   Create a forecasting system that predicts healthcare resource needs (hospital beds, ICU capacity, ventilators, staff) based on simulated disease progression. This functionality is essential because healthcare systems can be overwhelmed during pandemic events, and Dr. Okafor's work informs critical resource allocation decisions that directly impact patient outcomes and healthcare system resilience.

4. **Behavioral Adaptation Models for Population Response**  
   Build sophisticated behavioral models that capture how populations dynamically respond to disease prevalence, public health messaging, and implemented policies. This capability is crucial because human behavior significantly influences disease spread dynamics, and incorporating realistic behavioral responses allows Dr. Okafor to model intervention effectiveness under real-world conditions rather than assuming perfect compliance.

5. **Policy Effectiveness Comparison with Confidence Intervals**  
   Implement statistical analysis tools for comparing policy interventions across multiple scenarios with quantified uncertainty measures. This feature is important because decision-makers need to understand both the expected outcomes of different policies and the associated uncertainties, allowing Dr. Okafor to provide comprehensive analysis that acknowledges the inherent uncertainties in complex social-epidemiological systems.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All disease transmission models must be validatable against historical epidemiological data
- Intervention implementation must be precisely reproducible for comparative analysis
- Population behavior models must be calibratable to empirical behavioral data
- Resource utilization predictions must be testable against healthcare system capacity data

### Performance Expectations
- Must scale to simulate populations of at least 100 million individuals
- Should process at least 30 simulated days per minute of computation time
- Must support at least 100 simultaneous regions with distinct characteristics

- Result analysis should complete within 10 minutes for standard intervention comparisons

### Integration Points
- Data interfaces for importing demographic and geographic information
- API for defining custom disease progression models

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
