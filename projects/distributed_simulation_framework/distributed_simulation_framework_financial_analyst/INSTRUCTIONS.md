# Financial Risk Simulation Framework

## Overview
A specialized distributed simulation framework designed for financial risk analysts to evaluate investment portfolios across diverse economic scenarios. This framework enables efficient execution of Monte Carlo simulations, preserves correlations across market factors, models extreme events with realistic tail distributions, optimizes portfolios based on simulation outcomes, and generates regulatory compliance reports with comprehensive risk quantification.

## Persona Description
Sophia evaluates investment portfolios by simulating market conditions and economic scenarios. Her primary goal is to run Monte Carlo simulations across diverse economic scenarios to quantify risk exposure and optimize hedging strategies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Distributed Monte Carlo Engine with Stratified Sampling**
   - Efficient distribution of simulation workloads across multiple processes
   - Stratified sampling techniques to ensure coverage of the entire probability space
   - Variance reduction methods to improve estimation accuracy
   - Support for importance sampling to better capture rare but significant events
   - Critical for Sophia because financial risk assessment requires millions of simulation paths to accurately quantify tail risks, and distributing these computations while ensuring statistical validity is essential for timely risk analysis of complex portfolios

2. **Correlation Preservation Across Simulated Market Factors**
   - Accurate modeling of interdependencies between different asset classes and risk factors
   - Implementation of correlation matrices and copula functions
   - Support for dynamic correlation regimes that change based on market conditions
   - Stress testing of correlation assumptions under extreme scenarios
   - Critical for Sophia because financial markets exhibit complex correlations that dramatically impact portfolio risk, especially during market stress when correlations often increase, and failure to model these relationships correctly can significantly underestimate systemic risks

3. **Extreme Event Modeling with Realistic Tail Distributions**
   - Non-normal distribution modeling for market returns and risk factors
   - Implementation of fat-tailed distributions to capture extreme market movements
   - Scenario generation incorporating historical crisis events
   - Regime-switching capabilities to model changing market volatility
   - Critical for Sophia because traditional normal distribution models severely underestimate the probability of extreme market events, and realistic modeling of tail risks is essential for accurately assessing portfolio vulnerabilities to market crashes and other extreme conditions

4. **Portfolio Optimization Based on Simulation Outcomes**
   - Multi-objective optimization considering risk, return, and other constraints
   - Efficient calculation of risk metrics (VaR, Expected Shortfall, etc.) from simulation results
   - Hedging strategy evaluation and optimization
   - Sensitivity analysis to identify key risk drivers
   - Critical for Sophia because the ultimate goal of risk simulation is to improve investment decisions, and optimization algorithms that can process simulation results to recommend portfolio adjustments provide actionable insights for risk mitigation

5. **Regulatory Compliance Reporting with Risk Quantification**
   - Generation of standardized risk reports following regulatory requirements
   - Comprehensive calculation of required risk metrics and confidence intervals
   - Automated stress testing for regulatory scenarios
   - Audit trail for methodology and input assumptions
   - Critical for Sophia because financial institutions must meet strict regulatory requirements for risk reporting, and automating the generation of compliant reports with accurate risk quantification saves significant time while ensuring consistency and auditability
