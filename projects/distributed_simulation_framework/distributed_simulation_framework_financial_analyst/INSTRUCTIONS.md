# Financial Risk Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework designed specifically for financial risk analysts to model market conditions, evaluate investment portfolios, and quantify risk exposure. This framework excels at distributed Monte Carlo simulations, preserving market correlations, modeling extreme events, portfolio optimization, and generating regulatory compliance reports.

## Persona Description
Sophia evaluates investment portfolios by simulating market conditions and economic scenarios. Her primary goal is to run Monte Carlo simulations across diverse economic scenarios to quantify risk exposure and optimize hedging strategies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Distributed Monte Carlo Engine with Stratified Sampling**  
   Implement a high-performance Monte Carlo simulation system that distributes computations across multiple processes using stratified sampling techniques to ensure efficient coverage of the scenario space. This is critical for Sophia because financial risk assessment requires simulating thousands or millions of potential market scenarios to accurately quantify tail risks, which would be prohibitively time-consuming without efficient distribution techniques.

2. **Correlation Preservation Across Simulated Market Factors**  
   Develop mechanisms that accurately maintain the complex correlation structures between different financial instruments and market factors throughout simulations. This feature is essential because financial markets exhibit strong interdependencies, and Sophia needs to ensure that simulated scenarios reflect realistic co-movements between assets to avoid underestimating systemic risks.

3. **Extreme Event Modeling with Realistic Tail Distributions**  
   Create specialized modeling capabilities for low-probability, high-impact market events (crashes, liquidity crises, rapid regime shifts) with appropriate fat-tailed distributions. This capability is crucial for Sophia because standard normal distributions severely underestimate the frequency and severity of market extremes, and accurate tail risk assessment is a fundamental requirement for financial risk management.

4. **Portfolio Optimization Based on Simulation Outcomes**  
   Implement algorithms that can use simulation results to optimize investment portfolios according to various risk-return objectives and constraints. This feature is vital for Sophia's work because beyond just quantifying existing risks, she needs to provide actionable recommendations for portfolio adjustments to improve risk-adjusted returns and implement effective hedging strategies.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Reporting with Risk Quantification**  
   Develop reporting capabilities that generate required regulatory documents with appropriate risk metrics (VaR, Expected Shortfall, stress test results) based on simulation outcomes. This integration is essential for Sophia because financial institutions must satisfy strict regulatory requirements, and automated generation of compliant reports directly from simulation results ensures consistency and auditability.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
