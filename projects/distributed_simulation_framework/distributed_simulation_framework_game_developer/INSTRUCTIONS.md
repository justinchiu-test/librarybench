# Game Balance Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for game developers to test game balance and identify emergent strategies by simulating thousands of AI players with diverse play styles. This framework focuses on replay capabilities, AI player diversity, resource economy analysis, parallel universe testing, and strategy optimization detection.

## Persona Description
Priya oversees multiplayer game development requiring extensive simulation of game worlds before launch to identify balance issues and emergent strategies. Her primary goal is to simulate thousands of AI players with diverse play styles interacting in the game environment to ensure engaging, balanced gameplay.

## Key Requirements

1. **Replay System Capturing Key Simulation Decision Points**  
   Implement a system that records critical decision moments and state changes during simulations, enabling developers to replay and analyze specific interactions. This is critical for Priya because it allows her team to identify exactly when and how game balance issues emerge, providing concrete evidence for design decisions and enabling targeted fixes.

2. **AI Player Diversity with Customizable Strategy Profiles**  
   Develop a framework for creating AI players with different strategic approaches, skill levels, and play styles that can be customized to test various player demographics. This feature is essential because Priya needs to ensure the game remains balanced and engaging across a wide spectrum of player types, from casual newcomers to competitive veterans with different strategic preferences.

3. **Resource Economy Analysis with Balance Visualization**  
   Create tools that track and visualize resource flows, accumulation rates, and utilization patterns throughout the game economy. This capability is crucial for Priya because understanding the game's economic balance is fundamental to preventing dominant strategies based on resource exploitation, ensuring that all strategic options remain viable.

4. **Parallel Universe Testing (A/B Testing Game Mechanics)**  
   Implement functionality to run multiple simulation variants simultaneously with controlled differences in game mechanics or balance parameters. This feature is vital for Priya's team as it enables systematic comparison of different design options, quantifying their impact on gameplay and reducing the subjective elements of game design decisions.

5. **Strategy Optimization Detection to Identify Dominant Tactics**  
   Develop algorithms that can recognize when specific strategies consistently outperform others across various AI player profiles and scenarios. This integration is essential for Priya because identifying dominant strategies before release prevents gameplay from becoming stale or frustrating due to unintended optimization paths that skilled players will inevitably discover.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
