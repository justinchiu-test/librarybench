# Digital Manufacturing Process Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework designed specifically for manufacturing engineers to model and optimize complex assembly lines and production systems. This framework excels at synchronizing with real-time factory data, simulating process variations, modeling equipment failures, enabling component-level physics simulations, and optimizing layout and scheduling processes.

## Persona Description
Fatima optimizes industrial manufacturing processes by simulating complex assembly lines with robotic components. Her primary goal is to identify bottlenecks and test layout changes in virtual environments before implementing costly physical modifications to the factory floor.

## Key Requirements

1. **Digital Twin Synchronization with Real-Time Factory Data**  
   Implement a system that can ingest, process, and synchronize with live data feeds from manufacturing equipment to create and maintain accurate digital representations of the physical factory. This is critical for Fatima because it enables validation of simulation models against actual factory performance and allows for rapid identification of discrepancies between simulated and real processes.

2. **Process Variation Modeling with Statistical Distribution**  
   Develop capabilities to represent and simulate the inherent variations in manufacturing processes using appropriate statistical distributions derived from historical data. This feature is essential because real manufacturing environments never operate with perfect consistency, and Fatima needs to understand how natural variations impact overall production efficiency and quality.

3. **Equipment Failure Simulation with Maintenance Scheduling**  
   Create mechanisms for modeling equipment reliability, failure patterns, and the impact of different maintenance strategies on overall production. This capability is crucial for Fatima because equipment downtime significantly impacts manufacturing productivity, and optimizing maintenance schedules can dramatically improve efficiency without requiring capital investment.

4. **Component-Level Simulation with Physics-Based Interactions**  
   Implement a framework for detailed modeling of individual manufacturing components (robots, conveyors, tools) with realistic physics that capture their interactions and limitations. This feature is vital for Fatima's work because accurately simulating the physical constraints and capabilities of equipment is necessary to identify realistic improvement opportunities and avoid suggesting changes that wouldn't work in practice.

5. **Optimization Algorithms for Layout and Scheduling Improvements**  
   Develop optimization tools that can automatically identify potential improvements to factory layout and production scheduling based on simulation results. This integration is essential for Fatima because manually analyzing complex manufacturing simulations is time-consuming and may miss non-obvious optimization opportunities that algorithmic approaches can discover.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
