# Factory Process Simulation Framework

## Overview
A specialized distributed simulation framework designed for manufacturing process engineers to optimize industrial assembly lines and production systems. This framework enables the creation of detailed digital twins of factory environments, supports process variation modeling, simulates equipment failures, provides component-level physics-based interactions, and identifies optimal layouts and scheduling improvements.

## Persona Description
Fatima optimizes industrial manufacturing processes by simulating complex assembly lines with robotic components. Her primary goal is to identify bottlenecks and test layout changes in virtual environments before implementing costly physical modifications to the factory floor.

## Key Requirements

1. **Digital Twin Synchronization with Real-Time Factory Data**
   - Create and maintain virtual representations of physical manufacturing systems
   - Support bidirectional data flow between simulation and real factory sensors
   - Implement delta synchronization to efficiently update simulation state
   - Enable simulation calibration based on real-world performance metrics
   - Critical for Fatima because validating simulations against real factory data ensures accuracy and allows for identifying discrepancies between modeled and actual behavior, enabling continuous improvement of both the simulation and the physical factory

2. **Process Variation Modeling with Statistical Distribution**
   - Model variability in manufacturing processes using appropriate statistical distributions
   - Implement Monte Carlo methods to simulate natural variations in component specifications
   - Support correlation between related variation sources
   - Analyze the propagation of variations through the manufacturing process
   - Critical for Fatima because real manufacturing environments exhibit natural variations in timing, quality, and performance, and understanding how these variations affect overall production is essential for creating robust processes that maintain quality standards

3. **Equipment Failure Simulation with Maintenance Scheduling**
   - Model equipment failure modes with configurable probability distributions
   - Simulate the impact of failures on production flow and quality
   - Test preventive maintenance strategies and their effects on uptime
   - Optimize maintenance scheduling to minimize production impact
   - Critical for Fatima because equipment downtime significantly impacts manufacturing productivity, and optimizing maintenance schedules to balance preventive work against production needs is a key challenge in maintaining efficient operations

4. **Component-Level Simulation with Physics-Based Interactions**
   - Detailed modeling of individual manufacturing components with physical properties
   - Simulate mechanical interactions between components and materials
   - Support for energy consumption and thermal effects modeling
   - Enable detection of physical constraints and collisions
   - Critical for Fatima because understanding the physical interactions between components helps identify potential issues like collisions, clearance problems, or excessive wear before implementing changes to the physical factory, preventing costly mistakes

5. **Optimization Algorithms for Layout and Scheduling Improvements**
   - Automated testing of multiple layout configurations
   - Production scheduling optimization with constraint satisfaction
   - Multi-objective optimization balancing throughput, quality, and resource utilization
   - Sensitivity analysis to identify high-impact improvement opportunities
   - Critical for Fatima because finding optimal configurations manually is impossible given the vast number of possible layouts and schedules, requiring computational optimization to identify non-obvious improvements that can significantly increase efficiency
