# Tactical Combat Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for military training that creates realistic combat scenarios with intelligent adaptive adversaries. This framework excels at modeling adversarial AI with tactical intelligence, terrain-aware computation distribution, realistic command and control simulation, decision point analysis, and flexible scenario customization.

## Persona Description
Major Chen develops training simulations for military personnel to practice decision-making in complex scenarios. His primary goal is to create realistic combat simulations with intelligent adversaries that adapt to trainee decisions while efficiently utilizing limited computing resources.

## Key Requirements

1. **Adversarial AI with Adaptive Tactical Behavior**  
   Implement sophisticated AI opponents that can learn from trainee tactics, adapt their strategies, and employ realistic military doctrine appropriate to their simulated forces. This is critical for Major Chen because effective training requires adversaries that provide appropriate challenges without being predictable, forcing trainees to continually adapt their own tactics rather than exploiting fixed AI patterns.

2. **Terrain-Aware Partitioning for Distributed Computation**  
   Develop a system that divides simulation workloads based on terrain features and tactical situation, distributing computation efficiently while maintaining seamless interaction across partition boundaries. This feature is essential because military simulations often involve vast operational areas with varying densities of activity, and terrain-aware partitioning enables efficient resource utilization without artificial boundaries that would impact tactical realism.

3. **Realistic Command and Control Simulation with Fog of War**  
   Create mechanisms that simulate realistic military command structures, communication limitations, and incomplete information environments (fog of war). This capability is crucial for Major Chen because command friction and information limitations are fundamental aspects of military operations, and trainees must learn to make decisions under uncertainty with realistic command constraints.

4. **Decision Point Analysis for After-Action Review**  
   Implement tools that identify critical decision points during simulations, capture the context and options available, and enable detailed review of alternative choices and their potential outcomes. This feature is vital for Major Chen's training objectives because after-action review is a cornerstone of military learning, and identifying key decision points allows instructors to focus debriefs on the most instructive moments in complex scenarios.

5. **Scenario Authoring Tools for Instructor Customization**  
   Develop capabilities that allow instructors to efficiently create, modify, and customize training scenarios without programming knowledge, including defining force compositions, objectives, terrain conditions, and trigger events. This integration is essential for Major Chen because training needs evolve rapidly, and instructors need to quickly create targeted scenarios that address specific training objectives or emerging tactical challenges.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
