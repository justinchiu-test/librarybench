# Global Supply Chain Resilience Framework

## Overview
A specialized distributed simulation framework designed for supply chain managers to model, analyze, and optimize end-to-end supply chain operations under various conditions. This framework enables multi-echelon inventory optimization, disruption scenario modeling, transportation network optimization, supplier reliability simulation, and strategic evaluation of buffer stock versus just-in-time approaches.

## Persona Description
Leila manages global supply chain operations requiring optimization across manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation. Her primary goal is to simulate end-to-end supply chains under various disruption scenarios to develop resilient logistics strategies and contingency plans.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization**
   - Model inventory across multiple tiers of the supply chain (suppliers, manufacturing, distribution centers, retail)
   - Simulate inventory policies with different parameters at each node
   - Calculate optimal inventory levels considering service levels, lead times, and demand variability
   - Support for different replenishment strategies and their impact on system performance
   - Critical for Leila because global supply chains involve complex networks of inventory locations, and finding the optimal inventory levels across these tiers can dramatically reduce costs while maintaining service levels

2. **Disruption Scenario Modeling with Recovery Simulation**
   - Simulate various disruption types (natural disasters, supplier failures, transportation blockages, demand shocks)
   - Model cascading effects of disruptions through the supply chain
   - Evaluate different recovery strategies and their effectiveness
   - Analyze time-to-recovery and total impact metrics under different scenarios
   - Critical for Leila because supply chain resilience requires understanding vulnerability to disruptions and the effectiveness of different recovery strategies, enabling targeted investments in contingency plans and alternative sourcing

3. **Transportation Network Optimization with Cost Modeling**
   - Simulate global transportation networks with multiple modes (sea, air, rail, road)
   - Model transportation costs, times, and capacities realistically
   - Optimize routing and carrier selection based on time, cost, and reliability constraints
   - Evaluate hub-and-spoke versus direct shipping strategies
   - Critical for Leila because transportation represents a major cost component in global supply chains, and optimizing the network design and carrier selection can significantly reduce costs and lead times while maintaining reliability

4. **Supplier Reliability Simulation with Alternative Sourcing**
   - Model supplier performance including quality, lead time variability, and capacity constraints
   - Simulate supplier failure scenarios and their impact on production
   - Evaluate multi-sourcing strategies and their cost-benefit tradeoffs
   - Optimize supplier selection and order allocation
   - Critical for Leila because supplier reliability directly impacts production continuity, and developing effective multi-sourcing strategies requires understanding the cost-benefit tradeoffs of different supplier portfolios and allocation policies

5. **Just-in-Time vs Buffer Stock Strategy Evaluation**
   - Compare lean (just-in-time) versus buffer stock approaches under different conditions
   - Model the cost impact of inventory holding versus stockout risks
   - Simulate hybrid strategies with selective buffering for critical components
   - Evaluate strategy performance under different demand and supply variability scenarios
   - Critical for Leila because the choice between just-in-time and buffer inventory strategies has major implications for cost, responsiveness, and resilience, requiring quantitative analysis to determine the optimal approach for different products and market conditions
