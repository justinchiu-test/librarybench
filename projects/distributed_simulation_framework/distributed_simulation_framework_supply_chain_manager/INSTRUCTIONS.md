# Supply Chain Resilience Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework tailored for supply chain managers to model global logistics networks, test disruption scenarios, and develop resilient strategies. This framework excels at multi-echelon inventory optimization, disruption modeling, transportation network analysis, supplier reliability simulation, and buffer stock strategy evaluation.

## Persona Description
Leila manages global supply chain operations requiring optimization across manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation. Her primary goal is to simulate end-to-end supply chains under various disruption scenarios to develop resilient logistics strategies and contingency plans.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization**  
   Implement a system that models and optimizes inventory levels across multiple tiers of the supply chain (suppliers, manufacturing, distribution centers, retail) while balancing costs and service levels. This is critical for Leila because optimizing inventory throughout the entire supply network is substantially more complex than single-location optimization, requiring consideration of interdependencies and ripple effects that can only be captured through sophisticated simulation.

2. **Disruption Scenario Modeling with Recovery Simulation**  
   Develop capabilities to model various types of supply chain disruptions (supplier failures, transportation blockages, demand spikes) and simulate the effectiveness of different recovery strategies. This feature is essential because supply chains face numerous potential disruptions, and Leila needs to quantitatively evaluate recovery approaches before implementing them to ensure business continuity with minimal financial impact.

3. **Transportation Network Optimization with Cost Modeling**  
   Create mechanisms for modeling global transportation networks with multiple modes (sea, air, rail, truck) and optimizing logistics decisions based on time, cost, and reliability tradeoffs. This capability is crucial for Leila because transportation represents a major cost component in global supply chains, and finding optimal routing strategies across complex networks offers significant savings opportunities.

4. **Supplier Reliability Simulation with Alternative Sourcing**  
   Implement realistic modeling of supplier performance including variability in quality, delivery time, and availability, with capabilities for simulating alternative sourcing strategies. This feature is vital for Leila's work because supplier unreliability is a common disruptor in global supply chains, and developing robust multi-sourcing strategies requires understanding the complex interplay between reliability, cost, and lead time across potential suppliers.

5. **Just-in-Time vs Buffer Stock Strategy Evaluation**  
   Develop tools to compare different inventory philosophies (lean/JIT vs. buffer stock) across various scenarios and quantify the resilience vs. efficiency tradeoffs. This integration is essential for Leila because the tension between operational efficiency and disruption resilience is a fundamental supply chain challenge, requiring sophisticated simulation to make evidence-based decisions about appropriate inventory strategies for different product categories and market conditions.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
