# Metropolitan Traffic Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework designed specifically for urban transportation planners to model city-wide traffic patterns, evaluate infrastructure changes, and analyze policy impacts. This framework focuses on geographic partitioning, scenario comparison, stochastic event injection, agent behavior modeling, and infrastructure cost-benefit analysis for comprehensive transportation planning.

## Persona Description
Miguel models city transportation networks to evaluate the impact of new infrastructure and policy changes. His primary goal is to simulate traffic patterns across entire metropolitan areas with realistic driver behavior models while efficiently distributing computation across department resources.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geographic Partitioning with Boundary Synchronization**  
   Implement a system that divides city areas into manageable segments that can be simulated on separate computing resources while maintaining seamless interaction at boundaries. This is critical for Miguel because transportation networks span entire metropolitan areas, requiring efficient distribution of computation while preserving realistic traffic flow across partitioned boundaries.

2. **Scenario Comparison Tools for Policy Evaluation**  
   Develop capabilities to run multiple simulation scenarios in parallel with consistent metrics for comparison of different transportation policies or infrastructure changes. This feature is essential because Miguel needs to quantitatively evaluate the relative impact of various proposed changes to justify recommendations to city planners and policymakers.

3. **Stochastic Event Injection with Propagation Effects**  
   Create mechanisms for introducing random events (accidents, weather conditions, construction) with realistic propagation of their effects throughout the transportation network. This capability is crucial for Miguel because real-world transportation systems regularly face unpredictable disruptions, and understanding their cascading effects is vital for creating resilient infrastructure plans.

4. **Behavioral Model Library for Different Agent Types**  
   Implement a framework for defining and customizing behavior models for different types of transportation agents (commuters, delivery vehicles, public transit). This feature is vital for Miguel's work because realistic traffic patterns emerge from the diverse behaviors and objectives of different road users, requiring specialized modeling approaches for each type.

5. **Infrastructure Cost-Benefit Analysis with Simulation Validation**  
   Develop tools to associate infrastructure changes with implementation costs and quantify benefits through simulation results. This integration is essential for Miguel because transportation planning requires balancing limited municipal budgets against potential improvements, making ROI analysis a fundamental part of the decision-making process.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` to create a library structure with a proper `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`.
3. Run the code using `uv run python your_script.py`.
4. Execute tests with `uv run pytest`.

All functionality should be implemented as Python modules with well-defined APIs. Focus on creating a library that can be imported and used programmatically rather than an application with a user interface.
