# Urban Transportation Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework specialized for urban transportation planners to model and evaluate complex city traffic patterns and infrastructure changes. The framework enables simulation of entire metropolitan areas with realistic driver behavior models, allowing planners to assess the impact of new infrastructure and policy changes before implementation.

## Persona Description
Miguel models city transportation networks to evaluate the impact of new infrastructure and policy changes. His primary goal is to simulate traffic patterns across entire metropolitan areas with realistic driver behavior models while efficiently distributing computation across department resources.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geographic Partitioning with Boundary Synchronization**  
   Implement an intelligent spatial decomposition system that divides urban areas into manageable regions with efficient boundary synchronization between partitions. This capability is critical for Miguel because city-scale traffic simulations are computationally intensive, and geographic partitioning allows him to simulate entire metropolitan areas by distributing the workload across multiple computing nodes while maintaining consistency at region boundaries.

2. **Scenario Comparison Tools for Policy Evaluation**  
   Develop comprehensive tools for defining, executing, and statistically comparing multiple infrastructure and policy scenarios with consistent metrics and visualization-ready outputs. This feature is vital because transportation planners need to evaluate numerous alternatives (lane additions, signal timing changes, congestion pricing, etc.) and provide evidence-based recommendations to decision-makers with clear comparisons of expected outcomes.

3. **Stochastic Event Injection with Propagation Effects**  
   Create a system for modeling unexpected events (accidents, weather conditions, road closures) with realistic propagation effects throughout the transportation network. This functionality is essential because real-world transportation systems regularly experience disruptions, and understanding how these events propagate through networks allows Miguel to design more resilient infrastructure and develop effective incident response strategies.

4. **Behavioral Model Library for Different Agent Types**  
   Build an extensible library of behavioral models for various transportation system users (commuters, commercial drivers, public transit, pedestrians, cyclists) with configurable parameters and decision-making processes. This capability enables Miguel to simulate how diverse populations will interact with and respond to changes in transportation systems, ensuring that plans accommodate the needs and behaviors of all user groups.

5. **Infrastructure Cost-Benefit Analysis with Simulation Validation**  
   Implement integrated economic analysis tools that calculate costs, benefits, and return on investment for infrastructure projects based on simulation outcomes. This feature is important because transportation projects require substantial public investment, and the ability to quantify benefits (reduced congestion, improved safety, lower emissions) helps Miguel justify projects to stakeholders and prioritize investments for maximum community benefit.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All traffic flow models must be validatable against real-world traffic count data
- Behavioral models must produce statistically realistic patterns compared to survey data
- Geographic partitioning must yield identical results regardless of partition boundaries

### Integration Points
- Data interfaces for importing standard GIS and transportation network formats
- API for customizing driver behavior models and decision processes

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report

  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
