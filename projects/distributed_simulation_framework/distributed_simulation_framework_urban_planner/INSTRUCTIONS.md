# Metropolitan Traffic Simulation Framework

## Overview
A specialized distributed simulation framework designed for urban transportation planners to model and evaluate traffic patterns across entire metropolitan areas. This framework enables realistic simulation of traffic flows, driver behaviors, and infrastructure changes with efficient geographic partitioning to distribute computational load across available resources.

## Persona Description
Miguel models city transportation networks to evaluate the impact of new infrastructure and policy changes. His primary goal is to simulate traffic patterns across entire metropolitan areas with realistic driver behavior models while efficiently distributing computation across department resources.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geographic Partitioning with Boundary Synchronization**
   - Divide large metropolitan areas into geographic zones for distributed processing
   - Implement intelligent boundary management to handle vehicles crossing between partitions
   - Ensure seamless synchronization of traffic state at partition boundaries
   - Support dynamic repartitioning based on computational load and traffic density
   - Critical for Miguel because metropolitan-scale simulations are computationally intensive, and geographic partitioning allows efficient use of available computing resources while maintaining simulation accuracy at boundary regions where major traffic flows occur

2. **Scenario Comparison Tools for Policy Evaluation**
   - Run multiple simulation scenarios in parallel with different parameters
   - Provide tools to compare key metrics between scenarios (travel time, congestion, emissions)
   - Generate detailed differential reports highlighting the impacts of policy changes
   - Support for statistical analysis of outcome variations across multiple runs
   - Critical for Miguel because transportation planners need to evaluate multiple policy options and infrastructure changes to identify optimal solutions, requiring robust comparison tools to quantify differences between scenarios

3. **Stochastic Event Injection with Propagation Effects**
   - Ability to introduce random or scheduled events (accidents, weather conditions, road closures)
   - Model realistic propagation of traffic impacts from these events
   - Configure event probability distributions based on historical data
   - Track cascading effects across the transportation network
   - Critical for Miguel because real-world traffic patterns are significantly affected by unpredictable events, and understanding how these events propagate through the network is essential for resilient transportation planning

4. **Behavioral Model Library for Different Agent Types**
   - Support for multiple driver behavior models (commuters, commercial, cautious, aggressive)
   - Public transport vehicle modeling with scheduling and passenger interactions
   - Pedestrian and cyclist agent models for multi-modal simulations
   - Configurable decision-making parameters for each agent type
   - Critical for Miguel because accurate traffic simulation requires modeling different transportation users with distinct behavioral patterns, route preferences, and responses to conditions

5. **Infrastructure Cost-Benefit Analysis with Simulation Validation**
   - Integration of infrastructure costs into simulation scenarios
   - Calculate return-on-investment metrics based on simulation outcomes
   - Identify optimal infrastructure investments based on cost-benefit ratios
   - Validate simulation predictions against historical data where available
   - Critical for Miguel because transportation departments have limited budgets and must justify infrastructure investments based on expected benefits, requiring tools that quantify the value of proposed changes
