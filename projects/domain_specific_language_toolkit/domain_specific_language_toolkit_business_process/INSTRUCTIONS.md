# Business Process Definition Language Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit for defining and executing business processes that bridge the gap between process diagrams and executable workflow code.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages focused on business process definition. It enables business analysts to define operational workflows that can be directly translated into executable code, bridging the gap between business process models and IT implementation. The system emphasizes BPMN compliance, role-based access, KPI monitoring, resource optimization, and regulatory compliance.

## Persona Description

Priya helps organizations optimize their operational workflows and business processes. Her primary goal is to develop a business process language that bridges the gap between process diagrams created by business analysts and executable workflow code implemented by IT teams.

## Key Requirements

1. **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) compliant visual editor**
   - Implement a data structure and code generation system that represents business processes in BPMN-compliant formats
   - This feature is essential for Priya because BPMN is the industry standard for business process modeling. By supporting this notation, she enables business analysts to work with familiar visual representations while ensuring the underlying executable code remains synchronized with these diagrams, eliminating translation errors between business requirements and implementation.

2. **Role-based access patterns for organizational processes**
   - Develop a framework for defining role-based permissions and access controls within business processes
   - This capability addresses the complex organizational realities that Priya encounters, where different stakeholders need varying levels of access to process steps and data. It enables her to design processes that respect organizational hierarchies and compliance requirements while maintaining security and appropriate segregation of duties.

3. **KPI (Key Performance Indicator) definition and monitoring integration**
   - Create a system for defining process KPIs and integrating their measurement into process execution
   - Performance measurement is critical for process optimization. This feature allows Priya to help organizations define meaningful metrics directly within process definitions and gather performance data during execution, enabling data-driven process improvement and alignment with strategic objectives.

4. **Resource allocation optimization with constraint solving**
   - Build an optimization engine that can analyze resource requirements across processes and suggest optimal allocations
   - Efficient resource utilization is often a primary goal of process optimization. This capability enables Priya to identify and resolve resource bottlenecks, balance workloads, and maximize throughput while working within organizational constraints, delivering tangible efficiency improvements.

5. **Compliance rule checking for industry-specific regulations**
   - Implement a validation system that checks process definitions against regulatory requirements and compliance frameworks
   - Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable in many industries. This feature allows Priya to ensure that designed processes inherently comply with relevant regulations, reducing compliance risk and avoiding costly remediation efforts that often arise when compliance is treated as an afterthought.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Process definitions must be testable through simulated execution paths
- Role-based access controls must be verifiable against organizational scenarios
- KPI measurements must be testable with simulated process execution data
- Resource allocation algorithms must be verifiable with constrained resource scenarios
- Compliance validation must be testable against industry-specific regulatory frameworks

### Performance Expectations
- Process compilation must complete within 3 seconds for processes with up to 100 steps
- Resource optimization algorithms must complete analysis within 30 seconds for complex scenarios
- Compliance validation must complete within 10 seconds for comprehensive rule sets
- KPI calculations must process historical data for 10,000+ process instances within 2 minutes
- The system must support concurrent execution of up to 500 process instances

### Integration Points
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for organizational data
- Business intelligence platforms for KPI reporting
- Identity and access management systems for role validation
- Workflow execution engines for process deployment
- Compliance management systems for regulatory requirements

### Key Constraints
- No UI components; all visualization capabilities must be expressed through data structures
- All process definitions must be deterministic and reproducible
- The system must maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance
- All functionality must be accessible via well-defined APIs
- Process definitions must be serializable for storage and version control

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Business Process Definition Language**: A grammar and parser for defining organizational processes with workflow logic, decision points, and business rules.

2. **BPMN Representation**: Data structures and transformations that represent processes in standard BPMN notation and enable bidirectional synchronization with code.

3. **Role Management**: A system for defining organizational roles, responsibilities, and access controls within process definitions.

4. **KPI Framework**: Tools for defining performance indicators, collecting measurement data, and calculating metrics during process execution.

5. **Resource Optimization**: Algorithms for analyzing resource requirements across processes and optimizing allocation under constraints.

6. **Compliance Validation**: Rules and checks that ensure process definitions conform to regulatory requirements and organizational policies.

7. **Process Compilation**: Translation of high-level process definitions into executable workflow code for IT implementation.

8. **Execution Monitoring**: Mechanisms for tracking process execution and comparing actual vs. expected performance.

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate parsing of process definitions from domain-specific syntax
- Correct representation of processes in BPMN-compliant formats
