# Business Process Modeling Language Toolkit

## Overview
A specialized Domain Specific Language toolkit for defining, analyzing, and implementing organizational workflows and business processes. This toolkit bridges the gap between business process diagrams and executable workflow code, enabling business analysts to create precise process definitions that can be directly implemented by IT teams without extensive translation or interpretation.

## Persona Description
Priya helps organizations optimize their operational workflows and business processes. Her primary goal is to develop a business process language that bridges the gap between process diagrams created by business analysts and executable workflow code implemented by IT teams.

## Key Requirements
1. **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) compliant visual editor**: A library that can translate between standard BPMN diagrams and the underlying DSL code, maintaining bidirectional synchronization. This is critical because BPMN is the established standard for business process modeling that business analysts are already familiar with, and this capability allows existing process diagrams to be converted to executable code and vice versa.

2. **Role-based access patterns for organizational processes**: Functionality to define and enforce role-based permissions, responsibilities, and handoffs within business processes. This is essential because organizational processes typically involve multiple stakeholders with different responsibilities and access rights, and clear role definitions are necessary for proper process governance, accountability, and security.

3. **KPI (Key Performance Indicator) definition and monitoring integration**: The ability to define process-specific KPIs and integrate with monitoring systems to track process performance against business objectives. This is vital because measuring process performance is fundamental to continuous improvement, and embedding KPI definitions directly in process models ensures alignment between process execution and business goals.

4. **Resource allocation optimization with constraint solving**: Algorithms to allocate human, system, and physical resources to process activities while respecting constraints like availability, skills, costs, and priorities. This is necessary because efficient resource allocation is often the key to process optimization, and mathematical constraint solving can identify non-obvious allocation strategies that maximize throughput and minimize costs.

5. **Compliance rule checking for industry-specific regulations**: Automated validation of processes against regulatory requirements and industry standards, identifying potential compliance issues. This is crucial because regulatory compliance is a major concern for many organizations, with significant penalties for violations, and automated checking reduces the risk of designing non-compliant processes.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Each process definition must be automatically verifiable against BPMN standards
  - Role-based access patterns must be testable with simulated user scenarios
  - KPI calculations must be validated against expected business outcomes
  - Resource allocation algorithms must demonstrate optimality under constraints
  - All components must achieve at least 90% test coverage

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Process compilation must complete in under 3 seconds for processes with 100+ activities
  - Compliance validation must process a complex process against 1000+ rules in under 30 seconds
  - Resource optimization algorithms must solve for 500+ resources in under 60 seconds
  - System must handle enterprise-scale process models with 10,000+ elements without degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - BPMN modeling tools (Visio, Lucidchart, BPMN.io, etc.)
  - Workflow execution engines (Camunda, Flowable, etc.)
  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
  - Business intelligence and analytics platforms
  - Compliance management systems
  - Human resource management systems

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no UI components
  - All process logic must be expressible through the DSL without requiring custom code
  - Process definitions must be storable as human-readable text files
  - System must maintain compatibility with BPMN 2.0 standard
  - Resource allocation must account for real-world constraints like skills and availability

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The Business Process DSL Toolkit must provide:

1. A domain-specific language parser and interpreter specialized for business processes
2. Bidirectional translation between BPMN diagrams and DSL code
3. Role-based access control definition and enforcement
4. KPI definition, calculation, and monitoring integration
5. Resource allocation optimization using constraint solving
6. Compliance validation against regulatory requirements
7. Process simulation and bottleneck analysis
8. Documentation generation for process stakeholders
9. Version control and change tracking for process evolution
10. Test utilities for verifying process behavior with simulated data

The system should enable business analysts to define elements such as:
- Sequential and parallel process flows
- Decision gateways and conditional branches
- Event handling and exception management
- Timers, deadlines, and SLA constraints
- Human tasks and system activities
- Data objects and information flow
- Subprocess definitions and reuse
- Process boundaries and external interactions

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct parsing of DSL syntax into executable process representations
  - Accurate bidirectional translation between BPMN and DSL
  - Proper enforcement of role-based access patterns
  - Correct calculation and tracking of KPIs
  - Optimal resource allocation under various constraints

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Business analyst converts BPMN diagram to executable process definition
  - Process owner defines KPIs for monitoring process performance
  - Compliance officer validates process against regulatory requirements
  - Operations manager optimizes resource allocation for maximum efficiency
  - IT implementer deploys process definition to workflow engine

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Translate a complex BPMN diagram (100+ elements) to DSL in under 5 seconds
  - Validate process compliance against 500+ regulations in under 30 seconds
  - Optimize resource allocation for a process with 100+ activities in under 60 seconds
  - Simulate 1000+ process instances with varied parameters in under 5 minutes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of incomplete or ambiguous process definitions
  - Detection of deadlocks and infinite loops in process designs
  - Management of conflicting compliance requirements
  - Resource allocation under severe constraint conflicts
  - Process behavior during unexpected system or human failures

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage of process parser and interpreter
  - 100% coverage of BPMN translation components
  - 95% coverage of resource optimization algorithms

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and operational
2. Each requirement passes its associated test scenarios
3. The system demonstrates bidirectional translation between BPMN and executable code
4. Role-based access patterns correctly enforce organizational responsibilities
5. KPI definitions are properly integrated with monitoring capabilities
6. Resource allocation algorithms produce optimal assignments under constraints
7. Compliance validation correctly identifies regulatory issues
8. Business analysts without programming expertise can define executable processes

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona
