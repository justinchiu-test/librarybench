# Adaptive Learning Path Definition Language

A domain-specific language toolkit for creating personalized educational pathways with branching logic based on student performance and learning styles.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages focused on educational curriculum design and adaptive learning paths. It enables educators without technical backgrounds to define personalized learning journeys with branching logic based on student performance and learning preferences. The system emphasizes educational scaffolding, learning objective mapping, accessibility, adaptive assessment, and engagement analytics.

## Persona Description

Jamal develops adaptive learning platforms for K-12 education. His primary goal is to create a language that allows educators without technical backgrounds to define personalized learning paths with branching logic based on student performance and learning styles.

## Key Requirements

1. **Educational scaffolding patterns with progression templates**
   - Implement a library of reusable educational scaffolding patterns that represent proven pedagogical approaches for knowledge building
   - This capability is crucial for Jamal because it enables educators to leverage established educational theory without requiring deep pedagogical expertise. These templates provide structured frameworks for creating sequenced learning experiences that gradually build competency while supporting students at different skill levels.

2. **Learning objective mapping to curriculum standards**
   - Develop a system for mapping learning activities and assessments to standardized curriculum objectives and educational standards
   - This feature is essential because it ensures that adaptive learning paths remain aligned with required educational standards despite their personalized nature. It enables Jamal to demonstrate how adaptive content meets regulated curriculum requirements and facilitates reporting on standards-based learning outcomes.

3. **Accessibility rule checking for inclusive content delivery**
   - Create a validation system that checks learning path definitions against accessibility guidelines and best practices
   - Ensuring that educational content is accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, is a fundamental requirement. This capability enables Jamal to verify that learning paths incorporate appropriate accommodations and follow universal design principles, ensuring equitable access to educational opportunities.

4. **Adaptive assessment logic with difficulty scaling**
   - Build a framework for defining assessment rules that automatically adjust difficulty based on student performance
   - This adaptive capability is at the core of personalized learning, allowing the system to appropriately challenge each student. It enables Jamal to create learning experiences that avoid both frustration (from excessive difficulty) and disengagement (from insufficient challenge), optimizing the learning experience for individual students.

5. **Student engagement optimization through pathway analytics**
   - Implement an analytics system that can measure and predict student engagement with different learning path variations
   - Understanding how students engage with content is critical for iterative improvement of learning paths. This feature provides Jamal with data-driven insights about which educational approaches are most effective for different student segments, enabling continuous refinement of the adaptive learning experience.
