# Adaptive Learning Path Design Language Toolkit

## Overview
A specialized Domain Specific Language toolkit for educators to create personalized learning pathways with branching logic and adaptive content delivery. This toolkit enables educators without technical backgrounds to define sophisticated educational sequences that adjust based on student performance, learning preferences, and educational standards compliance.

## Persona Description
Jamal develops adaptive learning platforms for K-12 education. His primary goal is to create a language that allows educators without technical backgrounds to define personalized learning paths with branching logic based on student performance and learning styles.

## Key Requirements
1. **Educational scaffolding patterns with progression templates**: A library of predefined learning progression patterns based on pedagogical best practices that can be customized for different subjects and learning contexts. This is critical because it provides educators with research-based structures for knowledge building, ensures appropriate sequencing of learning activities, and promotes consistent skill development across various educational objectives.

2. **Learning objective mapping to curriculum standards**: Automatic linking of learning activities and assessments to recognized educational standards like Common Core, NGSS, or local curriculum frameworks. This is essential because it helps educators ensure compliance with required standards, provides accountability for educational outcomes, and simplifies reporting for administrative purposes.

3. **Accessibility rule checking for inclusive content delivery**: Validation capabilities that ensure learning paths accommodate different learning abilities, conform to accessibility standards, and provide alternative content formats when needed. This is vital because it ensures educational content is available to all students regardless of disabilities, learning differences, or technical limitations, supporting equity in educational access.

4. **Adaptive assessment logic with difficulty scaling**: Dynamic assessment mechanisms that adjust question difficulty, format, or content based on student performance and demonstrated mastery levels. This is necessary because it provides more accurate measurement of student understanding, prevents frustration from overly difficult or trivially easy assessments, and efficiently identifies knowledge gaps.

5. **Student engagement optimization through pathway analytics**: Built-in analytics to track student engagement patterns and identify areas where learning paths may be causing disengagement or confusion. This is crucial because it allows educators to continuously improve learning sequences based on actual student experiences, target areas with low engagement, and maximize learning efficiency and motivation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Each learning path must be automatically verifiable against curriculum standards
  - Adaptive logic must be testable with simulated student performance profiles
  - Accessibility compliance must be systematically validated
  - Scaffolding patterns must be verified against pedagogical best practices
  - All components must achieve at least 90% test coverage

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Learning path validation must complete in under 5 seconds
  - Adaptive assessment logic must respond to student input in under 1 second
  - System must handle complex pathways with 200+ decision points without degradation
  - Analytics processing must handle data from 10,000+ student interactions efficiently

- **Integration Points**:
  - Learning Management Systems (LMS) through LTI and API interfaces
  - Student Information Systems for learner data
  - Curriculum standards databases (Common Core, NGSS, etc.)
  - Content repositories with educational resources
  - Analytics and reporting platforms

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no UI components
  - All pathway logic must be expressible through the DSL without requiring custom code
  - Learning path definitions must be storable as human-readable text files
  - System must maintain compliance with educational data privacy regulations (FERPA, COPPA)
  - All defined pathways must support offline export for low-connectivity environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The Adaptive Learning Path DSL Toolkit must provide:

1. A domain-specific language parser and interpreter specialized for educational pathways
2. A scaffolding pattern library based on established pedagogical approaches
3. Curriculum standards mapping and validation capabilities
4. Accessibility validation against WCAG and educational inclusion guidelines
5. Adaptive assessment logic with difficulty adjustment algorithms
6. Student engagement analytics and optimization suggestions
7. Export mechanisms for deploying pathways to learning management systems
8. Documentation generators that produce educator-friendly pathway guides
9. Version control and sharing capabilities for collaborative development
10. Test utilities for simulating student progress through defined pathways

The system should enable educators to define elements such as:
- Learning objectives and success criteria
- Content sequencing with prerequisites and dependencies
- Formative and summative assessment strategies
- Differentiation options based on student needs
- Remediation paths for addressing misconceptions
- Enrichment opportunities for advanced learners
- Cross-curricular connections between subjects
- Varied content formats for different learning styles

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct parsing of DSL syntax into executable learning path representations
  - Accurate mapping to curriculum standards
  - Proper validation of accessibility requirements
  - Correct application of adaptive assessment logic
  - Accurate analytics on student engagement and performance

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Teacher creates a differentiated math unit with multiple learning paths
  - Curriculum coordinator validates alignment with district standards
  - Special education teacher adapts existing content for specific learning needs
  - Educational researcher analyzes effectiveness of different pathway structures
  - District administrator implements consistent learning approaches across schools

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Validate a complex learning path (100+ activities) in under 5 seconds
  - Process standard mapping for 1000+ learning objectives in under 30 seconds
  - Generate analytics from 10,000 student interaction records in under 5 minutes
  - Apply adaptive logic to assessment selection in under 500ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of circular dependencies in learning prerequisites
  - Detection of learning dead-ends in complex branching paths
  - Management of extreme skill level differences in the same cohort
  - Graceful degradation when standard mappings are incomplete
  - Pathway behavior when student history data is limited or missing

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage of pathway parser and interpreter
  - 100% coverage of adaptive assessment logic
  - 95% coverage of standards mapping components

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and operational
2. Each requirement passes its associated test scenarios
3. The system demonstrates the ability to create educationally sound adaptive pathways
4. Standard mapping correctly identifies alignment with curriculum requirements
5. Accessibility validation successfully identifies inclusion issues
6. Adaptive assessment logic appropriately adjusts based on student performance
7. Analytics components correctly identify engagement patterns and optimization opportunities
8. Educators without programming expertise can create and modify learning paths
