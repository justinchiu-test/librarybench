# Adaptive Learning Path Language

A domain-specific language toolkit for creating personalized, adaptive educational pathways.

## Overview

This project delivers a specialized domain-specific language toolkit that enables educators to define flexible, branching learning paths with personalization rules based on student performance and learning preferences. The toolkit translates these educational pathway definitions into executable learning sequences that can adapt in real-time to student responses, ensuring each student receives an optimized learning experience without requiring educators to have programming expertise.

## Persona Description

Jamal develops adaptive learning platforms for K-12 education. His primary goal is to create a language that allows educators without technical backgrounds to define personalized learning paths with branching logic based on student performance and learning styles.

## Key Requirements

1. **Educational scaffolding patterns with progression templates**
   - Essential for Jamal because educators regularly employ established pedagogical approaches (such as constructivist scaffolding, mastery learning, or spaced repetition), and providing templates allows them to quickly implement research-based instructional design patterns.
   - The DSL must include pre-defined patterns for common educational progression strategies while allowing customization to specific subject matter and learning objectives.

2. **Learning objective mapping to curriculum standards**
   - Critical because K-12 education materials must align with established curriculum standards (Common Core, NGSS, state standards), and Jamal needs to ensure that adaptive pathways comprehensively cover required learning objectives.
   - The system must support mapping learning content and activities to standardized curriculum frameworks, enabling validation that all required standards are addressed in any given learning path.

3. **Accessibility rule checking for inclusive content delivery**
   - Vital because educational materials must be accessible to all students including those with disabilities, and Jamal needs to ensure that adaptive pathways include appropriate accommodations and alternative content formats.
   - The DSL must provide a way to define content accessibility characteristics and validation rules that flag potential accessibility issues in learning paths.

4. **Adaptive assessment logic with difficulty scaling**
   - Necessary because effective personalized learning requires continuous assessment that adapts to student performance, presenting more challenging content when students demonstrate mastery and remedial content when they struggle.
   - The toolkit must support defining assessment rules that dynamically adjust difficulty levels and question selection based on student response patterns and performance history.

5. **Student engagement optimization through pathway analytics**
   - Important because student motivation and engagement are critical factors in learning outcomes, and Jamal needs to define pathways that adapt to individual engagement patterns to maximize student persistence and interest.
   - The system must provide mechanisms to track engagement metrics within learning paths and define rules for adapting content presentation and activities based on these metrics.

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All learning path definitions must be testable with simulated student interactions
  - Adaptive branching logic must achieve 100% path coverage in testing
  - Tests must validate content alignment with specified curriculum standards
  - Accessibility compliance must be automatically verified
  - Performance metrics must be measurable with synthetic student data

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Path validation must complete within 3 seconds for typical learning sequences
  - Adaptive decision making must respond in under 200ms
  - The system must handle learning paths with up to 500 content nodes
  - Memory usage must not exceed 250MB for the toolkit core
  - The system must support concurrent analysis of up to 100 student pathways

- **Integration Points**
  - Learning Management Systems (LMS) for content delivery
  - Student Information Systems (SIS) for learner data access
  - Curriculum standards databases for alignment verification
  - Analytics platforms for learning effectiveness measurement
  - Content repositories for educational material access

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must comply with student data privacy regulations (FERPA, COPPA)
  - Must work in environments with intermittent connectivity
  - Must support both synchronous and asynchronous learning modes
  - Must maintain detailed learning progress records for reporting
  - Must accommodate diverse learning environments (classroom, remote, hybrid)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces. The library should produce data that could be visualized by external tools, not implementing the visualization itself.

## Core Functionality
