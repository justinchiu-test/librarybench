# Financial Regulatory Compliance DSL Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit specialized for encoding and validating financial regulatory compliance rules.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing and executing domain-specific languages focused on financial regulatory compliance. It enables compliance officers to express complex regulatory constraints in a natural way while ensuring these rules are correctly translated into trading system validations. The framework includes tools for rule definition, validation, conflict detection, and integration with financial transaction systems.

## Persona Description

Sophia works at a large investment bank where complex regulatory compliance rules need to be encoded into trading systems. Her primary goal is to create a domain-specific language that allows compliance officers to express regulatory constraints in a natural way while ensuring these rules are correctly translated into trading system validations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Financial regulation template library with jurisdiction-specific rule patterns**
   - Implement a comprehensive template library that encapsulates common regulatory patterns across different jurisdictions (e.g., SEC, FINRA, MiFID II, Basel III)
   - This feature is critical as it allows compliance officers to quickly apply standardized regulatory frameworks without having to redefine common rule patterns, significantly reducing the risk of incomplete compliance coverage.

2. **Rule contradiction and conflict detection with resolution suggestions**
   - Develop an analysis system that can identify when newly added rules contradict existing ones or create logical conflicts
   - This capability is essential because financial regulations are complex and often overlapping; compliance officers need automated assistance to ensure rule sets remain logically consistent, avoiding situations where transactions are both required and forbidden by different rules.

3. **Natural language approximation for financial compliance terminology**
   - Create a domain-specific grammar that closely mirrors the terminology and phrasing used in actual financial regulations
   - This feature enables compliance officers to express rules in familiar language, reducing translation errors between regulatory documents and executable code, which is vital for accurate implementation of compliance requirements.

4. **Auditability through rule provenance and version tracking**
   - Implement a comprehensive tracking system that records the origin of each rule, including references to specific regulations, and maintains a complete version history
   - Auditability is non-negotiable in highly regulated financial environments; this feature provides the required documentation trail for regulatory examinations and demonstrates due diligence in compliance processes.

5. **Integration with financial transaction systems via standardized interfaces**
   - Design flexible integration interfaces that allow the rules engine to connect with various financial transaction systems
   - This integration capability ensures that compliance rules are actually enforced at transaction time, closing the gap between rule definition and practical application across diverse trading platforms and systems.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Each rule must be independently testable with specific test cases
- The conflict detection system must be verifiable with deliberately conflicting rule sets
- Integration points must support mock transaction systems for testing compliance validation
- Test coverage must include both syntactic and semantic validation of rule definitions
- Performance tests must verify rule evaluation speed meets transaction processing requirements

### Performance Expectations
- Rule evaluation must complete within 50ms for simple rules and 200ms for complex rule chains
- The system must support concurrent evaluation of at least 100 rule sets
- Parsing and compilation of new rules must complete within 3 seconds
- Conflict detection analysis must complete within 30 seconds for up to 1000 interdependent rules
- Memory usage must not exceed 1GB during normal operation

### Integration Points
- Standardized API for financial transaction system integration (REST, gRPC)
- Database connectors for rule storage and retrieval (SQL and NoSQL options)
- Authentication and authorization integration for rule management
- Event system for rule evaluation logging and audit trail
- Export capabilities for compliance reports and documentation

### Key Constraints
- All rule definitions and evaluations must be deterministic and reproducible
- The system must operate without external network dependencies during rule evaluation
- Rule execution must be thread-safe and support concurrent transaction processing
- No UI components; all functionality must be exposed through APIs
- The system must be deployable in high-security environments with air-gapped configurations

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Rule Definition Language**: A grammar and parser for defining financial compliance rules that closely mirrors regulatory language while maintaining formal logic structure.

2. **Rule Compilation**: Translation of high-level rule definitions into executable validation logic that can be applied to financial transactions.

3. **Rule Evaluation Engine**: An efficient interpreter or compiler that applies defined rules to transaction data and determines compliance status.

4. **Conflict Detection**: Analysis tools that examine rule sets for logical contradictions, overlaps, redundancies, or gaps in compliance coverage.

5. **Template System**: Reusable rule patterns that encapsulate common regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions.

6. **Version Control**: Comprehensive tracking of rule changes, including who made changes, when, and references to specific regulations.

7. **Transaction Validation**: Interfaces for applying rule sets to financial transactions before execution, with clear pass/fail results and explanations.

8. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all rule definitions, changes, and evaluation results for compliance documentation.

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate parsing of rule definitions from domain-specific syntax
- Correct detection of rule conflicts and contradictions
- Proper enforcement of rules against sample transactions
- Accurate tracking of rule provenance and version history
- Successful integration with mock financial transaction systems

### Critical User Scenarios
- Compliance officer defines new regulatory rules using the DSL
- System detects conflicts between newly added and existing rules
- Rule set is applied to a batch of financial transactions
- Audit report is generated showing rule enforcement and violations
- Rule templates are instantiated for a specific jurisdiction

### Performance Benchmarks
- Rule evaluation throughput of at least 500 transactions per second
- Conflict detection analysis completed in under 1 minute for 1000 rules
- Rule compilation completed in under 5 seconds
- System maintains performance with rule sets containing up to 10,000 individual rules
- Memory usage remains below specified limits during peak operation

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of circular rule references and dependencies
- Proper response to malformed or ambiguous rule definitions
- Graceful degradation under extremely high transaction volumes
- Recovery from partial rule set compilation failures
- Handling of transactions that trigger multiple conflicting rules

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core rule parsing and evaluation logic
- 100% coverage of rule conflict detection algorithms
- 95% coverage of template instantiation logic
- 90% coverage for transaction validation interfaces
- 100% test coverage for rule provenance and version tracking

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Compliance officers can define regulatory rules using domain-specific terminology with minimal technical assistance.

2. The system automatically detects and reports rule conflicts with actionable resolution suggestions.

3. Rules are successfully applied to financial transactions with clear validation results and explanations.

4. The audit trail provides comprehensive documentation of rule provenance, changes, and enforcement actions.

5. The system maintains required performance levels under production transaction volumes.

6. Rule templates reduce implementation time for new regulations by at least 60%.

7. Integration with financial transaction systems prevents non-compliant transactions from executing.

8. All test requirements are met with specified coverage metrics and performance benchmarks.
