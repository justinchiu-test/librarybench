# Game Logic Definition Language Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit for creating complex game narratives, quest systems, and character interactions without programming intervention.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages focused on game design logic. It enables narrative designers and game designers to create intricate quest lines and character interactions without requiring programmer intervention. The system emphasizes narrative branching, character state management, world persistence, economy balancing, and quest dependency validation.

## Persona Description

Alex leads a team creating an RPG game with complex character progression and quest systems. His primary goal is to build a game logic language that allows narrative designers and game designers to create intricate quest lines and character interactions without requiring programmer intervention.

## Key Requirements

1. **Narrative branching visualization with consequence tracking**
   - Implement a system for defining branching narrative structures with automatic tracking of story consequences across multiple paths
   - This feature is essential for Alex because complex RPG narratives often involve hundreds of branching story paths with interconnected consequences. This capability enables his narrative designers to create rich, reactive stories while automatically tracking how player choices in one branch affect story elements in other branches, eliminating common continuity errors.

2. **Character state management with personality trait modeling**
   - Develop a framework for defining character states, personality traits, and behavioral rules that govern NPC interactions
   - Creating believable, consistent characters across a large game world is a significant challenge. This feature allows Alex's team to define complex character models with traits that influence behavior, dialogue options, and relationships, enabling more emergent and natural-feeling character interactions without hard-coding every possible scenario.

3. **World state persistence with trigger-based event system**
   - Create a state management system that tracks game world changes and triggers events based on complex combinations of conditions
   - Maintaining a persistent, reactive game world is critical for immersive RPGs. This capability enables Alex's designers to define how the game world responds to player actions over time, creating the illusion of a living world where past actions have meaningful consequences through an event system that doesn't require programming to configure.

4. **Economy balancing tools with progression curve analysis**
   - Build analytical tools that can simulate and visualize player progression through game economies and reward systems
   - Game economies are notoriously difficult to balance. This feature allows Alex's designers to model how players will progress through the game's rewards and challenges, identifying potential progression bottlenecks or exploits before implementation, which is critical for maintaining player engagement throughout the game experience.

5. **Quest dependency validation preventing progression deadlocks**
   - Implement a validation system that detects potential progression blockers, cycles, or unreachable states in quest dependencies
   - Quest dependencies in complex RPGs can create unintended dead ends if not carefully managed. This capability enables Alex's team to automatically validate quest structures to ensure players can never become permanently stuck or unable to progress due to complex interdependencies between quests, items, or world states.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Each narrative branch must be independently testable with specific player choice sequences
- Character behavior models must be verifiable with simulated interaction scenarios
- World state transitions must be testable with specific event trigger combinations
- Economy simulations must be replicable with documented player progression models
- Quest dependency graphs must be analyzable for completeness and accessibility

### Performance Expectations
- Story compilation must complete within 3 seconds for narratives with up to 500 branches
- Character state evaluations must occur in real-time during gameplay (< 50ms)
- World state updates must process up to 100 concurrent changes in under 100ms
- Economy simulations must process 1000+ player progression scenarios in under 1 minute
- Dependency validation must analyze complex quest networks in under 10 seconds

### Integration Points
- Game engine scripting systems for runtime execution
- Asset management systems for content references
- Version control for narrative and quest definitions
- Localization systems for dialogue and text content
- Analytics platforms for gameplay data collection

### Key Constraints
- No UI components; all visualization capabilities must be expressed through data structures
- All game logic must be deterministic and reproducible for testing
- The system must support concurrent modification by multiple designers
- All definitions must be serializable for storage and version control
- The system must perform efficiently in both development and runtime environments

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Game Logic Definition Language**: A grammar and parser for defining narrative structures, character behaviors, world events, and quest relationships.

2. **Narrative Branching**: Tools for creating complex branching narratives with conditional paths and consequence tracking across storylines.

3. **Character Modeling**: A system for defining character attributes, personality traits, relationships, and behavioral rules.

4. **World State Management**: Mechanisms for tracking changes to the game world and triggering events based on state conditions.

5. **Economy Simulation**: Analytical tools for modeling player progression through game economies and balancing reward systems.

6. **Quest Dependencies**: Frameworks for defining relationships between quests, objectives, and world states with validation for progression blockers.

7. **Compilation Pipeline**: Translation of high-level game logic definitions into executable code for the target game engine.

8. **Debugging Tools**: Methods for testing and troubleshooting game logic definitions through simulation and analysis.

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate parsing of game logic definitions from domain-specific syntax
- Correct evaluation of narrative branching conditions and consequences
- Proper modeling of character behaviors based on defined traits
- Effective triggering of world events in response to state changes
- Reliable detection of progression blockers in quest dependency networks

### Critical User Scenarios
- Narrative designer creates a branching storyline with multiple outcomes
- Character designer defines personality traits and interaction rules for NPCs
- World designer creates a reactive environment with state-dependent events
- Economy designer balances progression curves for player advancement
- Quest designer establishes dependencies between quest objectives and validates progression

### Performance Benchmarks
- Narrative compilation completed in under 3 seconds for complex storylines
- Character state evaluation completed in under 50ms during gameplay
- World state updates processing 100+ changes in under 100ms
- Economy simulations processing 1000+ scenarios in under 1 minute
- Dependency validation completed in under 10 seconds for quest networks

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of circular narrative references or infinite loops
- Proper response to contradictory character trait definitions
- Graceful degradation when world state becomes extremely complex
- Recovery from partial compilation failures
- Handling of unreachable but valid quest states

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core game logic parsing and compilation
- 100% coverage of quest dependency validation algorithms
- 95% coverage of narrative branching logic
- 90% coverage for character state evaluation
- 100% test coverage for progression blocking detection

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Narrative and game designers can create complex interactive content without requiring programmer intervention.

2. The system automatically detects and prevents common design issues like unreachable quest states or progression deadlocks.

3. Character behaviors demonstrate consistent personality traits across different game contexts.

4. The game world reacts appropriately to player actions through the event triggering system.

5. Economy balancing tools accurately predict and help optimize player progression rates.

6. The time required to implement and test narrative and quest content is reduced by at least 70%.
