# Clinical Protocol Definition Language Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit for defining, validating, and executing standardized clinical care protocols.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages focused on clinical protocol definition. It enables healthcare professionals to define precise care workflows while automatically ensuring they conform to best practices and safety guidelines. The system emphasizes medical terminology integration, evidence-based validation, pathway visualization, interaction checking, and effectiveness analytics.

## Persona Description

Dr. Chen works with clinical teams to standardize treatment protocols across a hospital network. Her primary goal is to create a medical protocol language that allows clinicians to define precise care workflows while automatically ensuring they conform to best practices and safety guidelines.

## Key Requirements

1. **Medical terminology integration with standard healthcare ontologies**
   - Implement integration with established medical ontologies such as SNOMED CT, RxNorm, and LOINC to provide standardized terminology for protocol definitions
   - This feature is essential for Dr. Chen because it ensures protocols use precise, universally understood medical terminology rather than ambiguous natural language. This standardization prevents misinterpretation of protocols across different clinical settings and enables semantic validation of protocol steps against evidence-based guidelines.

2. **Clinical decision support rule validation against evidence databases**
   - Develop a validation system that can verify protocol steps against evidence-based guidelines and medical knowledge bases
   - This capability is critical for patient safety, as it ensures protocols align with the latest medical evidence. It helps Dr. Chen avoid outdated practices and provides confidence that standardized protocols reflect current best practices, reducing the risk of preventable adverse events.

3. **Patient pathway visualization generated from protocol definitions**
   - Create a data representation system that can transform protocol definitions into visual clinical pathways
   - Visual representation of complex protocols is vital for effective communication with clinical teams. This feature allows Dr. Chen to generate clear pathway visualizations directly from protocol definitions, ensuring consistency between the executable protocol and the documentation used by clinicians.

4. **Cross-protocol interaction checking for medication conflicts**
   - Build an analysis system that can detect potential conflicts when multiple protocols might be applied to the same patient, particularly regarding medication interactions
   - In hospital settings, patients often have multiple conditions requiring different protocols. This feature helps Dr. Chen identify and mitigate risks from protocol interactions, particularly around medication conflicts, which is essential for patient safety in complex care scenarios.

5. **Protocol effectiveness analytics with outcome correlation**
   - Implement an analytics framework that can associate protocol execution data with patient outcomes to measure effectiveness
   - This data-driven capability enables Dr. Chen to continuously improve protocols based on real-world evidence. By correlating protocol adherence with clinical outcomes, she can identify which protocol elements most significantly impact patient care and focus standardization efforts on high-value interventions.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Each protocol definition must be independently testable with simulated patient scenarios
- Decision support validation must be verifiable against evidence databases
- Interaction checking must be testable with deliberately conflicting protocols
- Protocol effectiveness metrics must be calculable from test execution data
- Test coverage must include both typical and edge case clinical scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Protocol validation must complete within 3 seconds for standard care protocols
- Interaction checking must complete within 5 seconds when analyzing interactions between 10+ protocols
- Terminology resolution must occur in near real-time during protocol definition
- Analytics calculations must process data for 10,000+ protocol executions within 1 minute
- The system must support concurrent validation of multiple protocols

### Integration Points
- Medical terminology services (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm) via standard APIs
- Evidence-based medicine databases for validation rules
- Electronic health record systems for protocol execution and data collection
- Clinical data repositories for outcomes analysis
- Medical knowledge bases for drug interaction checking

### Key Constraints
- All protocol definitions must be deterministic and reproducible
- The system must maintain strict patient data privacy in compliance with regulations
- No UI components; all visualization capabilities must be represented as data
- Protocol execution must be traceable for audit purposes
- All terminology must map to standardized medical coding systems

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Protocol Definition Language**: A grammar and parser for defining clinical care protocols with standardized medical terminology and workflow logic.

2. **Terminology Resolution**: A system for mapping protocol elements to standardized medical ontologies and maintaining consistent terminology.

3. **Evidence Validation**: Mechanisms for checking protocol steps against evidence-based guidelines and best practices.

4. **Protocol Compilation**: Translation of high-level protocol definitions into executable care pathways that can be integrated with clinical systems.

5. **Interaction Analysis**: Tools for detecting potential conflicts between protocols, particularly regarding medication interactions and contraindications.

6. **Pathway Representation**: Data structures that can represent clinical pathways in a form suitable for visualization.

7. **Effectiveness Measurement**: A framework for collecting and analyzing data on protocol execution and patient outcomes.

8. **Protocol Versioning**: Comprehensive tracking of protocol changes, approvals, and implementation status.

## Testing Requirements
