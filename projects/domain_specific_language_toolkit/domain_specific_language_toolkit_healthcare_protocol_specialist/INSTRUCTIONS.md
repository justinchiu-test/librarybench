# Clinical Protocol Definition Language

A domain-specific language toolkit for creating standardized, evidence-based medical treatment protocols.

## Overview

This project delivers a specialized domain-specific language toolkit that enables healthcare professionals to define precise clinical care protocols and treatment pathways without requiring programming expertise. The toolkit translates protocol definitions into executable workflows that can be integrated with healthcare information systems while ensuring compliance with medical best practices, safety guidelines, and evidence-based medicine.

## Persona Description

Dr. Chen works with clinical teams to standardize treatment protocols across a hospital network. Her primary goal is to create a medical protocol language that allows clinicians to define precise care workflows while automatically ensuring they conform to best practices and safety guidelines.

## Key Requirements

1. **Medical terminology integration with standard healthcare ontologies**
   - Essential for Dr. Chen because clinical protocols must use precise, standardized medical terminology to avoid ambiguity and enable interoperability across different healthcare systems and departments.
   - The DSL must incorporate and validate terminology against established medical ontologies such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC, and RxNorm, ensuring consistent and accurate terminology usage throughout protocols.

2. **Clinical decision support rule validation against evidence databases**
   - Critical because medical protocols must reflect current evidence-based practice, and Dr. Chen needs to ensure that protocol definitions are supported by medical literature and clinical guidelines.
   - The system must validate protocol decision points against clinical evidence databases, providing references to supporting literature and alerting when protocol elements deviate from established guidelines.

3. **Patient pathway visualization generated from protocol definitions**
   - Vital for Dr. Chen as healthcare teams need to understand the complete patient journey through a protocol, visualizing decision points, interventions, assessments, and expected outcomes.
   - The toolkit must generate structured representations of the care pathway from protocol definitions that could be visualized by external tools used by healthcare professionals.

4. **Cross-protocol interaction checking for medication conflicts**
   - Necessary because patients often follow multiple treatment protocols simultaneously for comorbid conditions, and Dr. Chen needs to ensure that protocols don't prescribe conflicting medications or treatments.
   - The DSL must support defining medication components with interaction properties and provide analysis tools to detect potential conflicts when multiple protocols are applied concurrently.

5. **Protocol effectiveness analytics with outcome correlation**
   - Important because Dr. Chen needs to evaluate and continuously improve treatment protocols based on real-world outcomes, identifying areas for refinement and optimization.
   - The system must define clear outcome metrics within protocols and provide a framework for correlating protocol adherence with patient outcomes to support evidence-based protocol improvement.

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All protocol definitions must be testable with simulated patient scenarios
  - Protocol branches must achieve 100% path coverage in testing
  - Safety-critical protocol elements require exhaustive test cases
  - Tests must validate protocol compliance with clinical guidelines
  - Protocol outcomes must be predictable and measurable in test environments

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Protocol validation must complete within 5 seconds for typical protocols
  - Decision support rule checking must respond in under 500ms
  - The system must handle protocols with up to 200 decision points
  - Memory usage must not exceed 300MB for the toolkit core
  - The system must support concurrent validation of up to 50 protocols

- **Integration Points**
  - Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for protocol execution
  - Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) for rule integration
  - Medical terminology servers for ontology validation
  - Evidence-based medicine databases for guideline verification
  - Healthcare analytics platforms for outcome analysis

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must comply with healthcare data privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)
  - Must operate within validated clinical computing environments
  - Must support both interactive and automatic protocol execution modes
  - Must maintain audit trails for all protocol definition changes
  - Must support protocol versioning with strict change control

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces. The visualization capabilities should generate structured data that could later be displayed by external tools, not implementing the visualization itself.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Clinical Protocol Definition Language encompasses:

1. **Protocol Definition Language**
   - Medical domain-specific syntax for treatment paths and decision points
   - Standardized terminology bindings to healthcare ontologies
   - Temporal constraint specification for intervention timing and sequencing

   - Outcome measurement and success criteria definitions

2. **Protocol Validation System**
   - Syntactic and semantic validation of protocol definitions
   - Terminology validation against medical ontologies
   - Clinical guideline compliance verification
   - Logical consistency checking for decision paths
   - Safety constraint validation for dosing and interventions

3. **Decision Support Framework**
   - Evidence linkage for protocol decision points
   - Contraindication and precaution checking
   - Context-sensitive clinical alerts and recommendations
   - Alternative intervention suggestion capabilities
   - Decision explanation with evidence citations

4. **Protocol Execution Model**
   - State machine definition for protocol progression
   - Transition conditions based on patient parameters
   - Intervention scheduling and timing management
   - Protocol deviation detection and management
   - Concurrent protocol coordination and synchronization

5. **Outcome Analysis System**
