# IoT Device Orchestration Language Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit for defining automated responses to environmental conditions across diverse sensor networks and control systems.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages focused on IoT device orchestration. It enables building managers to define automated responses to environmental conditions without understanding the underlying sensor communication protocols. The system emphasizes device capability discovery, temporal logic, energy optimization, failsafe validation, and physical world modeling.

## Persona Description

Carlos designs Internet of Things solutions for smart buildings with diverse sensor networks and control systems. His primary goal is to create a device orchestration language that allows building managers to define automated responses to environmental conditions without understanding the underlying sensor communication protocols.

## Key Requirements

1. **Device capability discovery and automatic syntax generation**
   - Implement a system that can dynamically discover the capabilities of connected IoT devices and generate appropriate language constructs for controlling them
   - This feature is critical for Carlos because it allows the language to adapt to heterogeneous device ecosystems without requiring manual configuration. It enables building managers to work with devices based on their functionalities rather than technical specifications, dramatically simplifying the creation of building automation rules.

2. **Temporal logic for sequence-dependent operations**
   - Develop a temporal logic framework for defining complex time-based and sequence-dependent operations across multiple devices
   - IoT automation frequently requires precise timing and sequencing of operations. This capability enables Carlos to create sophisticated automation scenarios that respond to events in specific orders or with defined timing relationships, which is essential for applications like staged lighting, sequential HVAC activation, or coordinated security responses.

3. **Energy optimization through pattern recognition**
   - Create an analysis system that can identify energy usage patterns and suggest optimizations within device orchestration rules
   - Energy efficiency is a primary concern in building management. This feature allows Carlos to develop intelligent building systems that automatically recognize usage patterns and optimize energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort, directly addressing a key business requirement for reducing operational costs.

4. **Failsafe validation ensuring critical systems remain operational**
   - Build a validation framework that ensures automation rules cannot compromise the operation of safety-critical systems or create dangerous conditions
   - Safety is non-negotiable in building automation, especially for systems like fire suppression, emergency lighting, or access control. This validation capability enables Carlos to guarantee that automated rules cannot override critical safety functions, providing essential safeguards for building occupants.

5. **Physical world modeling with spatial relationship definition**
   - Implement a physical world modeling system that represents spatial relationships between devices, areas, and occupants
   - Understanding the physical layout and relationships within a building is essential for meaningful automation. This feature enables Carlos to create context-aware automation that considers physical proximity, room adjacency, or occupant locations, making the system's responses more relevant and effective.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements

- Rule definitions must be serializable for storage and version control
- The system must support fallback operation when network connectivity is degraded

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Device Orchestration Language**: A grammar and parser for defining automation rules that control IoT devices based on environmental conditions and events.

2. **Capability Discovery**: Mechanisms for detecting the features and functions of connected devices and representing them as language constructs.

3. **Temporal Logic**: Tools for defining time-based relationships between events and actions, including sequences, schedules, and conditional timing.

4. **Energy Analysis**: Algorithms for analyzing device usage patterns and identifying energy optimization opportunities within automation rules.

5. **Failsafe Validation**: Rules and checks that ensure automation logic cannot compromise critical systems or create unsafe conditions.

6. **Spatial Modeling**: Data structures for representing physical relationships between devices, areas, and occupants within a building.

7. **Rule Compilation**: Translation of high-level orchestration rules into executable control commands for diverse IoT devices.

8. **Simulation Engine**: An environment for testing automation rules against virtual device networks and accelerated time scenarios.
