# IoT Device Orchestration Language Toolkit

A domain-specific language framework designed specifically for smart building automation and IoT device orchestration.

## Overview

The IoT Device Orchestration Language Toolkit enables building managers and facility operators to define automated responses to environmental conditions through a simplified language abstraction. This toolkit focuses on creating a domain-specific language that abstracts away complex IoT communication protocols, device-specific APIs, and low-level networking details, allowing non-technical users to create sophisticated device orchestration rules and automation workflows for smart buildings.

## Persona Description

Carlos designs Internet of Things solutions for smart buildings with diverse sensor networks and control systems. His primary goal is to create a device orchestration language that allows building managers to define automated responses to environmental conditions without understanding the underlying sensor communication protocols.

## Key Requirements

1. **Device capability discovery and automatic syntax generation**: The toolkit must automatically discover connected IoT devices, their capabilities, and generate appropriate language syntax for them. This feature is critical for Carlos as it eliminates the need for manual device configuration and ensures the language always reflects the actual devices available in the building's infrastructure, reducing configuration errors and allowing for dynamic device addition.

2. **Temporal logic for sequence-dependent operations**: The language must support expressing time-based relationships between events and actions, including delays, schedules, and conditional timing. This capability is essential for Carlos to implement complex building automation scenarios that depend on specific sequences of operations, time-of-day rules, and coordinated device actions that must occur in particular orders.

3. **Energy optimization through pattern recognition**: The toolkit must include facilities for defining and detecting usage patterns that can be used to optimize energy consumption. This requirement is vital for Carlos's clients who prioritize energy efficiency in their smart building implementations and need to demonstrate ROI through reduced energy costs while maintaining occupant comfort.

4. **Failsafe validation ensuring critical systems remain operational**: The language must include built-in safety analysis to prevent rule definitions that could compromise critical building systems. This feature is crucial for Carlos as it provides guardrails that prevent building managers from inadvertently creating automation rules that might disable safety systems, security features, or essential infrastructure, ensuring regulatory compliance and occupant safety.

5. **Physical world modeling with spatial relationship definition**: The toolkit must allow for modeling the physical layout of spaces and defining spatial relationships between devices and zones. This capability is essential for Carlos to create context-aware automations that respond appropriately based on the physical relationships between spaces, occupants, and devices, enabling truly intelligent building behaviors that account for spatial context.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be fully testable without requiring actual IoT hardware through comprehensive mocking capabilities
- The language parser and interpreter must be testable with simulated device inputs and environment conditions
- Device discovery mechanisms must be testable through simulated device advertisement endpoints
- Rule execution and temporal logic must support time acceleration for testing long-running sequences

### Performance Expectations
- Device discovery must complete within 60 seconds for environments with up to 500 devices
- Rule compilation must complete within 5 seconds for rules involving up to 50 devices
- Rule execution engine must process at least 100 events/second with rule sets containing up to 1000 rules
- Latency between trigger condition and action execution must not exceed 500ms for critical systems

### Integration Points
- Must provide adapters for common IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP, BACnet, Modbus, Z-Wave, and ZigBee)
- Must support standardized device schemas using W3C Web of Things or similar standardized description formats
- Must provide integration APIs for building management systems (BMS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
- Must support exporting rules to common automation platforms and edge computing environments

### Key Constraints
- The language design must prioritize readability by non-technical users over programming efficiency
- The toolkit must operate in environments with unreliable network connectivity with appropriate failsafe behaviors
- Resource usage must be optimized for deployment on edge computing devices with limited processing capabilities
- All communication with devices must be securable and support encryption where protocols allow it

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the IoT Device Orchestration Language Toolkit consists of:

1. **Device Discovery and Language Generation Subsystem**: Automatically discovers IoT devices on the network, identifies their capabilities, and dynamically generates appropriate language constructs and syntax to represent them. This includes generating device-specific predicates, actions, and properties that can be used in the DSL.

2. **DSL Parser and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Builder**: Provides a parser that translates the human-readable DSL into an abstract syntax tree, with comprehensive error detection and user-friendly error messages. The parser should enforce correct syntax while providing helpful suggestions for common mistakes.

3. **Temporal Logic and Scheduling Engine**: Implements temporal operators and constructs that allow expressing time-based relationships between events and actions. This includes support for sequences, delays, recurring schedules, and time-window conditions with proper handling of edge cases.

4. **Rule Validation and Safety Analyzer**: Analyzes rule definitions to identify potential conflicts, circular dependencies, safety violations, and failure modes. Provides warnings and errors when rules might compromise critical systems or create unintended consequences.

5. **Physical Space Modeler**: Provides constructs for defining the physical layout of spaces, zones, and the spatial relationships between devices. This includes concepts like adjacency, containment, and proximity that can be used in rule definitions.

6. **Pattern Recognition and Optimization Engine**: Implements algorithms to detect patterns in device usage and environmental conditions, with capabilities to define optimization goals and constraints for energy usage and other resources.

7. **Rule Execution Runtime**: Provides the execution environment for compiled rules, handling event processing, condition evaluation, and action dispatching with appropriate error handling and logging.

8. **Protocol Adapter Framework**: Offers a pluggable architecture for protocol adapters that translate between the DSL's abstract device operations and concrete protocol-specific commands for different IoT communication standards.
