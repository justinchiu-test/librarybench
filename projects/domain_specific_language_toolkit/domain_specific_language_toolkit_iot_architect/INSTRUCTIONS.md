# IoT Device Orchestration Language Toolkit

## Overview
A specialized Domain Specific Language toolkit for defining, controlling, and automating interactions between IoT devices in smart environments. This toolkit enables building managers and system integrators to create sophisticated device orchestration rules and automated responses to environmental conditions without requiring knowledge of underlying sensor protocols or programming expertise.

## Persona Description
Carlos designs Internet of Things solutions for smart buildings with diverse sensor networks and control systems. His primary goal is to create a device orchestration language that allows building managers to define automated responses to environmental conditions without understanding the underlying sensor communication protocols.

## Key Requirements
1. **Device capability discovery and automatic syntax generation**: Automatic detection and cataloging of available devices, their capabilities, and control interfaces with dynamic generation of device-specific DSL syntax. This is critical because it eliminates the need to manually define interfaces for each new device, accommodates the diverse and evolving IoT ecosystem, and reduces the technical knowledge required to incorporate new devices into automation rules.

2. **Temporal logic for sequence-dependent operations**: Support for time-based conditions, sequences, delays, and coordinated multi-device operations with precise timing constraints. This is essential because many building automation scenarios require specific ordering and timing (such as sequential startup procedures, staged responses to events, or synchronized operations across multiple systems) to function correctly and efficiently.

3. **Energy optimization through pattern recognition**: Pattern analysis capabilities that identify energy usage patterns and optimize device operations to reduce consumption while maintaining service levels. This is vital because energy efficiency is a primary concern for building operators, representing both environmental responsibility and significant cost savings, especially when automated optimization can discover non-obvious efficiency improvements.

4. **Failsafe validation ensuring critical systems remain operational**: Verification mechanisms that analyze automation rules to ensure they cannot inadvertently compromise critical building systems like security, life safety, or essential services. This is necessary because automation failures in building systems can have serious consequences for occupant safety, security, and comfort, and preventative validation is more reliable than reactive error handling.

5. **Physical world modeling with spatial relationship definition**: The ability to define spatial relationships between devices, zones, and building areas to enable location-aware automation rules. This is crucial because the physical layout and proximity relationships in buildings directly impact appropriate automation responses, and spatial context is fundamental to creating intuitive and effective building control systems.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Each automation rule must be automatically verifiable against device capabilities
  - Temporal logic must be testable with simulated time progression
  - Energy optimization algorithms must demonstrate measurable improvements
  - Failsafe validation must identify all potential critical system compromises
  - All components must achieve at least 90% test coverage

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Rule compilation must complete in under 2 seconds for buildings with 500+ devices
  - Device discovery must process and categorize 1000+ endpoints in under 60 seconds
  - Energy optimization analysis must complete for a full building in under 5 minutes
  - System must handle 10,000+ simultaneous sensor readings without degradation

- **Integration Points**:
  - Multiple IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP, BACnet, Modbus, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.)
  - Building Management Systems (BMS)
  - Energy monitoring and management platforms
  - Physical security systems
  - Weather and external data sources
  - Digital twins and building information models

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no UI components
  - All automation logic must be expressible through the DSL without requiring custom code
  - Rule definitions must be storable as human-readable text files
  - System must operate within network bandwidth constraints of typical building infrastructure
  - Critical failsafes must function even when central control systems are offline

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The IoT Orchestration DSL Toolkit must provide:

1. A domain-specific language parser and interpreter specialized for device orchestration
2. Device discovery and capability detection across multiple protocols
3. Temporal logic processing for sequence and timing control
4. Energy usage pattern recognition and optimization algorithms
5. Failsafe validation for critical systems protection
6. Spatial modeling of physical device relationships and zones
7. Rule deployment and execution across distributed IoT systems
8. Monitoring and logging of automation rule execution
9. Documentation generators for building management teams
10. Test and simulation utilities for verifying rule behavior

The system should enable building managers to define elements such as:
- Environmental condition responses (temperature, occupancy, air quality)
- Scheduled operations with calendar and time-based triggers
- Cross-system coordination (HVAC, lighting, security, access)
- Energy management and demand response actions
- Exception handling for device failures and anomalies
- Maintenance alerts and predictive maintenance triggers
- Occupant comfort optimization based on preferences
- Security and safety protocol automation

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct parsing of DSL syntax into executable device commands
  - Accurate discovery and categorization of device capabilities
  - Proper execution of temporal sequences with correct timing
  - Effective energy optimization with measurable improvements
  - Comprehensive failsafe validation protecting critical systems

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Building manager creates comfort optimization rules for office zones
  - Facility team implements energy-saving night setback procedures
  - Security personnel define automated responses to access control events
  - Sustainability manager creates demand-response automation for peak energy periods
  - Maintenance staff sets up predictive maintenance alerts based on sensor trends

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Process and compile 100 complex automation rules in under 10 seconds
  - Complete device discovery for a 25-floor building in under 2 minutes
  - Analyze a month of sensor data for energy optimization in under 10 minutes
  - Execute 500 simultaneous device commands with proper sequencing in under 3 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of partial device failures and degraded operation modes
  - Recovery from communication interruptions with edge devices
  - Management of conflicting automation rules with resolution strategies
  - Behavior during power outages or limited-power scenarios
  - Adaptation to unexpected seasonal or environmental changes

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage of DSL parser and interpreter
  - 100% coverage of failsafe validation mechanisms
  - 95% coverage of device discovery components

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
