# Manufacturing Process Definition Language Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit for defining, validating, and executing manufacturing processes and quality control workflows.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages tailored to manufacturing process definition. It enables process engineers to define complex manufacturing workflows and quality checks without requiring deep programming knowledge. The system focuses on equipment control, process simulation, fault handling, and physical constraint validation.

## Persona Description

Marcus designs automated manufacturing processes for an automotive company with complex assembly lines and quality control. His primary goal is to develop a language that allows process engineers to define manufacturing workflows and quality checks without requiring deep programming knowledge.

## Key Requirements

1. **Equipment-specific control syntax with vendor library integration**
   - Develop a modular syntax system that can incorporate equipment-specific commands and parameters from different vendors
   - This capability is essential for Marcus because manufacturing environments typically contain equipment from multiple vendors, each with their own control interfaces. Having a unified language that can abstract these differences while still providing access to vendor-specific capabilities dramatically simplifies process definition.

2. **Simulation environment for testing process definitions**
   - Create a simulation engine that can execute process definitions against virtual manufacturing equipment to validate behavior before deployment
   - This feature is critical for Marcus as it allows testing and refinement of complex manufacturing processes without risking physical equipment or materials. It significantly reduces development time and improves safety by catching potential issues before they reach the factory floor.

3. **Fault handling pattern library for common manufacturing exceptions**
   - Implement a comprehensive library of reusable fault handling patterns for typical manufacturing exceptions (e.g., part jams, alignment issues, quality failures)
   - Manufacturing processes must be robust against a wide range of potential failures. This capability enables Marcus to define resilient processes that can automatically respond to common issues, reducing downtime and ensuring consistent product quality.

4. **Physical constraint validation ensuring processes respect equipment limitations**
   - Build a validation system that checks if defined processes violate physical constraints of the equipment (e.g., speed limits, temperature ranges, reach envelopes)
   - This constraint checker is vital because it prevents definition of processes that could damage equipment or create unsafe conditions. It provides an essential safety net, especially when process definitions are created by engineers who may not be intimately familiar with all equipment limitations.

5. **Visual process flow designer that generates executable DSL code**
   - Provide a programmatic representation of process flows that can be visualized and manipulated as diagrams while maintaining bidirectional synchronization with the underlying code
   - This requirement bridges the gap between visual process design (which is intuitive for many engineers) and precise executable code. It enables Marcus to work with process engineers who think visually while still generating rigorous, executable process definitions.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Each process definition must be executable in a simulated environment
- Fault handling patterns must be individually testable with simulated failure conditions
- Equipment control interfaces must support mock implementations for testing
- Process validation must be verifiable against documented equipment constraints
- Test coverage must include both normal operation and exception handling scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Process compilation must complete within 5 seconds for complex manufacturing workflows
- Simulation execution should run at configurable speeds (from real-time to accelerated)
- Equipment control commands must be processed within their real-time control requirements
- Constraint validation must complete within 10 seconds for processes with up to 1000 steps
- The system must support concurrent simulation of multiple process variants

### Integration Points
- Equipment vendor library integration through standardized adapter interfaces
- Process data logging and analysis for quality metrics
- Manufacturing execution system (MES) integration for production deployment
- CAD/CAM system integration for physical layout validation
- Version control system integration for process definition management

### Key Constraints
- No UI components; all visualization capabilities must be expressed through data structures
- The system must be deterministic to ensure reproducible simulations
- Process definitions must be serializable for storage and version control
- All functionality must be accessible via well-defined APIs
- Security model must support role-based access to process definitions

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Process Definition Language**: A grammar and parser for defining manufacturing processes in terms of equipment actions, quality checks, and workflow logic.

2. **Equipment Abstraction Layer**: An interface system that normalizes control commands across different equipment vendors while preserving access to specialized capabilities.

3. **Simulation Engine**: An execution environment that can run process definitions against simulated equipment to validate behavior and performance.

4. **Fault Handler Framework**: A system for defining and registering exception handling patterns that can be reused across different processes.

5. **Constraint Validation**: A rule-based system that evaluates process definitions against equipment capabilities and physical limitations.

6. **Process Compilation**: Translation of high-level process definitions into executable control sequences for manufacturing equipment.

7. **Data Representation**: Structures that can represent process flows in a form that supports both textual and visual representations.

8. **Execution Monitoring**: Mechanisms for tracking the execution of processes and comparing actual vs. expected behavior.

## Testing Requirements

- Accurate parsing of process definitions from domain-specific syntax
- Correct simulation of equipment behavior under various process conditions

### Critical User Scenarios
- Process engineer defines a new manufacturing workflow using the DSL
- System detects and reports physical constraint violations in the process
- Process definition is simulated to validate timing and resource usage
- Fault handling patterns are applied to address potential failure modes
- Process is exported for integration with production control systems

### Performance Benchmarks

- Simulation execution at least 10x faster than real-time when accelerated
- Constraint validation completed in under 10 seconds for complex processes
- System maintains performance with large libraries of fault handling patterns
- Memory usage remains below specified limits during simulation

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of deadlocks in concurrent process steps
- Proper response to conflicting equipment commands
- Graceful degradation when simulation resources are constrained
- Recovery from partial process compilation failures
- Handling of equipment with incomplete or missing specifications

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core process parsing and validation logic
- 100% coverage of constraint checking algorithms
- 95% coverage of fault handling pattern implementation
