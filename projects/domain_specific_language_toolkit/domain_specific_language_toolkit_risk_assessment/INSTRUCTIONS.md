# Insurance Risk Assessment Language Framework

A domain-specific language toolkit for defining, validating, and executing complex underwriting rules for risk calculation.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for developing domain-specific languages focused on insurance risk assessment. It enables actuaries and underwriters to precisely define risk calculation logic while ensuring consistency across different insurance products. The system emphasizes statistical model integration, risk factor visualization, historical data validation, compliance verification, and sensitivity analysis.

## Persona Description

Olivia leads risk management for an insurance company that needs to define complex underwriting rules. Her primary goal is to create a risk assessment language that allows actuaries and underwriters to precisely define risk calculation logic while ensuring consistency across different insurance products.

## Key Requirements

1. **Statistical model integration with uncertainty quantification**
   - Implement a system for integrating statistical and actuarial models with explicit uncertainty quantification
   - This capability is essential for Olivia because modern insurance risk assessment relies on sophisticated statistical models. This feature enables her team to incorporate complex probabilistic models directly into underwriting rules while preserving information about prediction confidence, ensuring that risk pricing appropriately accounts for both the estimated risk and the uncertainty in that estimate.

2. **Risk factor relationship visualization with correlation analysis**
   - Develop a data representation system that can visualize the relationships and correlations between different risk factors
   - Understanding how risk factors relate to each other is critical for accurate risk assessment. This feature allows Olivia's team to identify and account for correlations between risk factors that might amplify or mitigate risk, preventing both underpricing (which threatens solvency) and overpricing (which reduces competitiveness).

3. **Historical data validation against previous assessments**
   - Create a validation framework that can test new underwriting rules against historical data and outcomes
   - This capability enables evidence-based rule development. It allows Olivia to verify that new or modified rules would have correctly assessed risk in historical cases, providing confidence that changes will improve accuracy rather than introducing new biases or errors in the underwriting process.

4. **Compliance verification with insurance regulations**
   - Build a verification system that checks underwriting rules against relevant regulatory requirements
   - Insurance is a highly regulated industry with strict rules about underwriting practices. This feature ensures that Olivia's risk assessment rules comply with all applicable regulations, preventing both financial penalties for non-compliance and potential reputational damage from improper underwriting practices.

5. **Sensitivity analysis identifying critical decision factors**
   - Implement sensitivity analysis tools that identify which factors have the greatest impact on risk assessment outcomes
   - This analytical capability is crucial for understanding risk drivers. It enables Olivia's team to identify which factors most significantly influence risk calculations, helping them focus data collection efforts, refine the most impactful rules, and explain assessment decisions to stakeholders and customers.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All risk assessment rules must be testable against historical case libraries
- Statistical model integrations must be verifiable with synthetic data generation
- Compliance checks must be testable against regulatory requirement test suites
- Sensitivity analysis must be verifiable with controlled input variations
- Test coverage must include edge cases and extreme risk scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Rule compilation must complete within 3 seconds for complex underwriting rulebooks
- Risk assessment for individual cases must complete within 500ms for real-time applications
- Batch processing must handle 10,000+ cases per hour for portfolio analysis
- Statistical model evaluations must complete within reasonable timeframes based on model complexity
- The system must support concurrent evaluation of multiple insurance products

### Integration Points
- Statistical and actuarial modeling libraries
- Historical claims and underwriting databases
- Regulatory compliance databases and updates
- Customer relationship management systems
- Reporting and business intelligence platforms

### Key Constraints
- All risk calculations must be deterministic and reproducible for audit purposes
- The system must maintain data privacy in compliance with regulations
- No UI components; all visualization capabilities must be expressed through data
- All assessment logic must be traceable for regulatory explanation
- The system must support version control of risk assessment rules

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a framework for:

1. **Risk Assessment Language**: A grammar and parser for defining underwriting rules and risk calculation logic with clear semantics.

2. **Statistical Integration**: Mechanisms for incorporating statistical and actuarial models into risk assessment rules with uncertainty handling.

3. **Factor Relationship Analysis**: Tools for analyzing and visualizing relationships between risk factors, including correlation analysis.

4. **Historical Validation**: Frameworks for testing risk assessment rules against historical data to validate accuracy.

5. **Compliance Checking**: Systems for verifying that underwriting rules conform to regulatory requirements and internal policies.

6. **Sensitivity Testing**: Methods for identifying the factors with the greatest impact on risk assessment outcomes through controlled variation.

7. **Rule Compilation**: Translation of high-level risk assessment rules into efficient executable code for production systems.

8. **Version Management**: Tools for managing changes to risk assessment rules with comprehensive audit trails.

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate parsing of risk assessment rules from domain-specific syntax
- Correct integration and evaluation of statistical models
- Proper detection of regulatory compliance violations
- Effective identification of critical risk factors through sensitivity analysis
- Reliable validation against historical underwriting data

### Critical User Scenarios
- Actuary defines new risk calculation rules for an insurance product
- System validates rules against regulatory requirements and historical data
- Underwriter applies risk assessment to a specific case or portfolio
- Sensitivity analysis identifies key factors driving risk assessment
- Compliance team verifies rule changes against regulatory requirements

### Performance Benchmarks
- Rule compilation completed in under 3 seconds for complex rule sets
- Risk assessment completed in under 500ms for individual cases
- Batch processing handling 10,000+ cases per hour
- Statistical model evaluation within performance parameters of the model complexity
- System maintains performance with multiple concurrent product assessments

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of missing or incomplete risk factor data
- Proper response to statistical model failures or anomalies
- Graceful degradation when historical validation data is limited
- Recovery from partial rule compilation failures
- Handling of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% line coverage for core rule parsing and compilation logic
- 100% coverage of compliance checking algorithms
- 95% coverage of statistical model integration
- 90% coverage for sensitivity analysis functions
- 100% test coverage for critical rating factors

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Actuaries and underwriters can define complex risk assessment logic without requiring programming expertise.

2. The system accurately integrates statistical models while appropriately quantifying uncertainty.

3. Risk assessment rules are automatically validated for regulatory compliance before deployment.

4. Historical data validation provides confidence in the accuracy of new or modified rules.

5. Sensitivity analysis provides clear insights into the factors driving risk assessment outcomes.

6. The time required to develop and validate new underwriting rules is reduced by at least 50%.

7. All test requirements are met with specified coverage metrics and performance benchmarks.

8. Consistency and accuracy of risk assessment across different insurance products is measurably improved.
