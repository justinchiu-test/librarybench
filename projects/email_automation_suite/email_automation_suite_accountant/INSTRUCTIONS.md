   - Enable searching across document attributes

3. **Tax Calendar Management**
   - Maintain deadline database with jurisdiction-specific dates
   - Generate client-specific deadline schedules
   - Trigger appropriate reminder sequences
   - Track filing status and completion

4. **Client Information Management**
   - Store client service details and preferences
   - Categorize clients by multiple dimensions
   - Track communication history by service type
   - Generate client segment reports

5. **Regulatory Communication System**
   - Maintain database of regulatory changes by jurisdiction and entity type
   - Generate targeted update communications
   - Track which clients have received specific updates
   - Archive regulatory communications by topic

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Document encryption and decryption accuracy and security
- Deadline calculation and reminder generation for various jurisdictions
- Template rendering with proper client-specific information
- Document classification accuracy for various financial statements
- Client categorization based on service attributes

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Securely requesting tax documents from clients

- Email processing rate of at least 30 emails per minute
- Document classification accuracy of at least 90%
- Search response time under 1 second for document queries
- System resource usage under 500MB with 1000 client documents

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling corrupted encrypted attachments
- Managing deadline changes due to regulatory extensions
- Processing documents in unsupported formats
- Dealing with incomplete financial information
- Recovering from interrupted secure transactions
- Handling multi-jurisdiction clients with conflicting deadlines
