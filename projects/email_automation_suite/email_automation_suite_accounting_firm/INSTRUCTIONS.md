# FinanceMailFlow - Accounting Practice Email Management System

## Overview
FinanceMailFlow is a specialized email automation system designed for small accounting firms that need to securely manage client communications, tax document exchanges, deadline tracking, financial data organization, and regulatory updates. The system streamlines accounting practice operations through intelligent email classification, secure document handling, compliance tracking, and client segmentation to improve service quality while maintaining strict security and regulatory standards.

## Persona Description
Maya runs a small accounting practice managing tax preparation and financial advisory services for dozens of clients. Her primary goal is to securely handle financial document exchanges while maintaining a structured communication calendar for tax deadlines and regulatory updates.

## Key Requirements

1. **Secure Document Request and Encrypted Attachment Management**
   - Implement templated document request emails for tax and financial information
   - Create secure, encrypted channels for document exchange
   - Track outstanding document requests and receipt status
   - Verify document completeness against requirement checklists
   - This feature is critical because secure document exchange is foundational to accounting practice, and automated tracking ensures nothing is missed while maintaining security standards required for sensitive financial information.

2. **Tax Deadline Management and Reminder System**
   - Track tax filing deadlines customized to each client's situation
   - Generate escalating reminder sequences as deadlines approach
   - Handle extension requests and modified deadline tracking
   - Provide visibility into upcoming deadline workload
   - This feature is essential because missed tax deadlines can result in significant penalties for clients, making a robust, automated deadline tracking system vital to accounting service quality and risk management.

3. **Client Categorization by Service Type and Fiscal Year**
   - Segment clients by service types (individual tax, business tax, advisory, etc.)
   - Organize communications based on fiscal year timing
   - Create custom communication schedules for different client types
   - Enable targeted messaging to specific client segments
   - This feature is vital because different client types have vastly different needs and timelines, and appropriate segmentation ensures communications are relevant and timely for each client's specific situation.

4. **Financial Document Organization and Classification**
   - Automatically tag and classify received financial documents
   - Extract key information from standard financial forms
   - Organize documents by client, tax year, and document type
   - Create searchable archives of financial information
   - This feature is crucial because accounting practices handle thousands of financial documents annually, and automated organization dramatically reduces filing time while improving retrieval speed for client service.

5. **Regulatory Update Distribution and Compliance Tracking**
   - Monitor and distribute relevant tax code and regulatory changes
   - Target updates to affected client segments
   - Track client acknowledgment of critical regulatory information
   - Maintain audit trail of compliance-related communications
   - This feature is invaluable because staying current with regulatory changes is a core value of accounting services, and targeted distribution ensures clients receive only relevant updates while maintaining records of important communications.
