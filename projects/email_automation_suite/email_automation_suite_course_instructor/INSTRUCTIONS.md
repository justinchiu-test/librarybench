A specialized email automation system tailored for online course instructors that organizes communications by course and assignment, automates responses to common student questions, streamlines grade notification processes, manages course announcements, and provides insights into student engagement patterns.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen teaches multiple online courses and needs to manage student communications, assignment submissions, and course announcements. Her primary goal is to provide timely, personalized responses to student questions while automatically handling routine course administration emails.

## Key Requirements

1. **Course-Specific Email Categorization System**
   - Automated organization of emails by course, module, and assignment
   - Submission tracking with timestamp verification and receipt confirmation
   - Advanced search functionality across course-specific communications
   - This feature is critical for Dr. Chen to maintain clear boundaries between different courses she teaches, ensuring student communications are properly organized and reducing the risk of confusion when responding to queries about different courses during the same time period.

2. **Common Question Detection and Response System**
   - Pattern matching algorithms to identify frequently asked questions
   - Suggested response templates with course-specific information
   - Learning capability to improve detection over time
   - This feature substantially reduces Dr. Chen's response time for common questions, ensuring students receive consistent, accurate answers while allowing her to focus her personal attention on more complex or unique inquiries.

3. **Grade Notification Automation**
   - Personalized grade delivery with custom feedback insertion
   - Batch processing for efficient distribution to entire class
   - Statistics generation for assignment performance analysis
   - This feature streamlines the time-consuming process of distributing grades and feedback to students, ensuring all students receive their results simultaneously with personalized comments while maintaining a comprehensive record of performance data.

4. **Course Milestone Management System**
   - Scheduled announcement sequences aligned with course calendar
   - Reminder workflows for upcoming deadlines and events
   - Module transition communications with preparatory information
   - This feature ensures Dr. Chen can maintain consistent, timely communication about course events and deadlines, reducing student confusion and last-minute queries by automating proactive announcements at appropriate intervals.

5. **Student Engagement Analytics**
   - Communication frequency tracking by student and topic
   - Participation pattern identification for early intervention
   - Correlation analysis between engagement and performance
   - This feature provides Dr. Chen with valuable insights into student interaction patterns, helping identify students who may be struggling or disengaged before it affects their performance, enabling targeted intervention at the appropriate time.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable without requiring actual email server connections
- Mock objects must be available for IMAP/SMTP services
- Course content management must be testable with sample course data
- Question detection algorithms must be testable with sample question datasets
- Grade processing must be verifiable with test student data

### Performance Expectations
- Processing of new emails should complete within 3 seconds
- Template personalization and sending should complete within 1 second
- Batch grade notifications should process at least 50 students per minute
- The system should handle up to 10 concurrent courses with 500 total students
- Search operations should return results within 2 seconds for specific queries

### Integration Points
- IMAP and SMTP protocols for email server communication
- Local database for storing course information, student data, and communication templates
- File system for managing assignment submissions and course materials
- Optional calendar system integration for course scheduling
- Export/import functionality for backup and migration

### Key Constraints
- Must work with standard email protocols (IMAP/SMTP)
- Must not require third-party services or APIs that incur additional costs
- Must protect student privacy and comply with educational data regulations
- Must operate efficiently on standard hardware without requiring cloud resources
- All data must be stored locally with proper backup procedures
- Must maintain strict separation between different courses' data

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. **Course Management Engine**
   - Store course information with modules, assignments, and schedules
   - Track course progress and upcoming milestones
   - Organize communications by course context
   - Manage student enrollment data by course

2. **Student Communication Processor**
   - Classify incoming student communications by type and course
   - Detect common questions with pattern matching algorithms
   - Generate appropriate responses with personalization
   - Track response times and communication patterns

3. **Assignment Management System**
   - Track submission receipt and timestamps
   - Process grade distribution with feedback
   - Generate performance statistics by assignment
   - Support batch operations for entire classes

4. **Announcement Scheduling System**
   - Define announcement sequences aligned with course calendar
   - Schedule timed notifications for upcoming deadlines
   - Manage module transitions and prerequisite information
   - Track announcement effectiveness

5. **Analytics Engine**
   - Monitor student engagement metrics
   - Identify patterns correlated with performance
   - Generate intervention recommendations
   - Produce course communication summary reports

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Email classification accuracy for different types of student communications
- Common question detection and appropriate response selection
- Grade processing and personalized feedback distribution
- Announcement scheduling and delivery reliability
- Student engagement metric calculation

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Processing multiple assignment submissions near deadlines
- Responding to various common question variants
- Distributing grades with personalized feedback to large classes
- Scheduling and delivering sequential course announcements
- Identifying students with declining engagement patterns

### Performance Benchmarks
- Email processing rate of at least 30 emails per minute
- Common question detection in under 500ms
- Batch grade notification to 100 students in under 3 minutes
- System memory usage under 300MB with 10 active courses
- Database query performance with large datasets (10,000+ communications)

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling late submissions and special circumstances
- Processing ambiguous questions that partially match templates
- Managing grade distribution with incomplete student data
- Recovering from interrupted announcement sequences
- Handling students added mid-course or changing course sections
- Properly managing course data across semesters for recurring courses

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage of question detection algorithms
- 100% coverage of grade processing logic
- 100% coverage of announcement scheduling system
- Comprehensive integration tests for end-to-end communication workflows
