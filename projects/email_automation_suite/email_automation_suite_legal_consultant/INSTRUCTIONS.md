3. **Billable Communication Tracking System**
   - Automatic time capture for client-related email activities
   - Classification of communications by billing category
   - Export functionality for billing system integration
   - This feature streamlines Carlos's billing workflow by automatically tracking time spent on email communications, ensuring accurate client billing without manual time-logging and reducing unbilled time through comprehensive activity capture.

4. **Document Request Management System**
   - Template-based document request generation
   - Tracking of outstanding document requests with automated follow-ups
   - Secure handling protocols for confidential documents
   - This feature enables Carlos to efficiently manage the document collection process critical to legal matters, ensuring consistent follow-up on outstanding requests while maintaining appropriate security measures for sensitive client documents.

5. **Secure Document Sharing Notification System**
   - Integration with secure portal notification workflows
   - Encrypted communication options for highly sensitive information
   - Access tracking for shared documents
   - This feature allows Carlos to maintain security compliance when sharing legal documents, providing clients with secure access to sensitive materials while tracking document access and maintaining a verifiable record of information sharing.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable without requiring actual email server connections
- Mock objects must be available for IMAP/SMTP services and calendar integration
- Case management must be testable with sample case data
- Deadline tracking must be verifiable with test calendar events
- Billable time tracking must be testable with sample communication sessions

### Performance Expectations
- Processing of new emails should complete within 3 seconds
- Template personalization and sending should complete within 1 second
- Confidentiality classification should occur within 500ms per message
- The system should handle up to 100 active cases and 300 clients
- Search operations across confidential communications should complete within 2 seconds

### Integration Points
- IMAP and SMTP protocols for email server communication

2. **Deadline Management System**
   - Track statutory, procedural, and client-specific deadlines
   - Generate reminder sequences with escalating urgency
   - Monitor deadline compliance and completion
   - Provide calendar integration for comprehensive scheduling

3. **Billable Activity Tracking**
   - Capture time spent on client-related email activities
   - Categorize communications by billing code
   - Calculate billable time with appropriate rounding rules
   - Generate exportable time records for billing purposes

4. **Document Management System**
   - Generate and track document requests
   - Monitor outstanding requests with follow-up automation
   - Apply appropriate security protocols to attachments
   - Maintain document histories by case and client

5. **Secure Communication Tools**
   - Integrate with secure client portal notifications
   - Provide encrypted communication options
   - Track secure document access and activity
   - Ensure compliant handling of privileged information

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Email classification accuracy for different types of legal communications
- Confidentiality tagging and access control enforcement
- Deadline tracking and reminder sequence generation
- Billable time calculation for different communication types
- Secure document sharing workflow operation

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Processing communications with varying confidentiality requirements
- Managing approaching legal deadlines with escalating reminders
- Tracking billable time across multiple client interactions
- Requesting and receiving sensitive documents securely
- Notifying clients of secure portal document availability

### Performance Benchmarks
- Email processing rate of at least 20 emails per minute
- Confidentiality classification in under 300ms per message
- Deadline calculation and reminder generation in under 500ms
- System memory usage under 300MB with 100 active cases
- Search performance across 10,000+ legal communications within 3 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling communications with ambiguous case associations
- Managing conflicting or overlapping deadlines
- Dealing with communications that span multiple billing categories
- Processing document requests with incomplete information
- Recovering from interrupted secure communication processes
- Handling conflicts of interest detection

### Required Test Coverage
