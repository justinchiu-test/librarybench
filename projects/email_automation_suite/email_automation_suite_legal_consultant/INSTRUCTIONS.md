# LegalMailFlow - Legal Consultation Email Management System

## Overview
LegalMailFlow is a specialized email automation system designed for independent legal consultants who need to efficiently manage client communications, case-related correspondence, confidential information, and billable activities. The system streamlines legal practice management through intelligent email organization, deadline tracking, secure document handling, and time tracking to improve client service while maintaining appropriate legal standards.

## Persona Description
Carlos provides legal consulting services to small businesses and must maintain detailed client communications while ensuring timely follow-ups on legal matters. His primary goal is to manage case-related emails with appropriate confidentiality while tracking billable communications and deadlines.

## Key Requirements

1. **Case-Based Email Organization with Confidentiality Classification**
   - Implement automatic categorization of emails by client, case, and matter
   - Apply appropriate confidentiality classifications based on content analysis
   - Create secure storage systems for sensitive client communications
   - Enable quick search and filtering with appropriate access controls
   - This feature is critical because it ensures client communications are properly organized and secured according to legal standards, reducing liability while improving efficiency in finding case-relevant information.

2. **Legal Deadline Tracking and Reminder System**
   - Track legal deadlines, statutes of limitations, and filing dates
   - Generate escalating reminder sequences as deadlines approach
   - Create automated priority flags for time-sensitive matters
   - Link deadline notifications to relevant case documentation
   - This feature is essential because missed deadlines in legal practice can have severe consequences for clients and practitioners, including malpractice liability, making systematic deadline management critical.

3. **Billable Time Tracking for Client Communications**
   - Automatically track time spent on email communications by client and matter
   - Generate time entries with appropriate billing codes and descriptions
   - Create billing reports and summaries for invoicing
   - Track billable vs. non-billable communications
   - This feature is vital because accurate time tracking is foundational to legal practice revenue, yet email time is often under-billed due to the difficulty of manual tracking, leading to significant lost income.

4. **Document Request and Secure Attachment Handling**
   - Create templated document request emails for common client needs
   - Implement secure handling for document attachments with encryption
   - Track outstanding document requests and receipt status
   - Organize received documents by client, case, and document type
   - This feature is crucial because document collection and management are core legal activities that require security, consistency, and tracking to maintain case progress and client confidence.

5. **Client Portal Notification and Secure Sharing System**
   - Generate secure document sharing links integrated with client portals
   - Create notification emails for portal updates and document availability
   - Track client engagement with shared documents
   - Implement secure messaging alternatives for confidential communications
   - This feature is invaluable because secure alternatives to email attachments are increasingly required for legal practice, improving security while providing auditable records of document access and delivery.

- Report generation must complete in <10 seconds with 12 months of data
- Security operations (encryption/decryption) must add no more than 500ms to processing
- Deadline calculations must process at least 100 dates per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- System must handle emails with multiple confidentiality requirements
- Deadline calculations must correctly handle jurisdictional variations and holidays
- The system must gracefully handle email server connection failures
- Conflict of interest situations must be flagged appropriately
- Document security must remain intact during system failures

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Unit test coverage must exceed 90% for all core modules
