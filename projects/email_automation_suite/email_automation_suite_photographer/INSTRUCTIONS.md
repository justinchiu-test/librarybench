# PhotoMailFlow - Event Photography Email Management System

## Overview
PhotoMailFlow is a specialized email automation system designed for event photographers who need to efficiently manage client inquiries, bookings, pre-event communications, gallery deliveries, and print sales. The system streamlines photography business operations through intelligent email management, event scheduling, client preparation, and sales follow-up to maximize both client satisfaction and business profitability.

## Persona Description
Elena photographs weddings and events, managing inquiries, bookings, and client galleries through email. Her primary goal is to streamline her booking process and client communications while ensuring timely delivery of photos and following up on sales opportunities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Booking Inquiry Management and Availability System**
   - Implement automatic inquiry response with service information and pricing
   - Check calendar availability against inquiry dates
   - Create customized package information based on event type and requirements
   - Track inquiry-to-booking conversion rates
   - This feature is critical because responding quickly to inquiries with accurate availability and pricing information significantly increases booking rates, while saving hours of manual calendar checking and response composition.

2. **Event Countdown and Preparation Sequence**
   - Create automated communication sequences leading up to booked events
   - Send scheduled questionnaires to gather event details at optimal times
   - Provide customized preparation guidance based on event type
   - Send reminders for critical pre-event milestones
   - This feature is essential because thorough pre-event preparation prevents mishaps, manages client expectations, and reduces last-minute questions, while ensuring Elena has all necessary information for successful event coverage.

3. **Photo Gallery Delivery Automation and Access Tracking**
   - Generate personalized gallery delivery emails with access credentials
   - Track when clients access their galleries for the first time
   - Send reminder sequences for galleries approaching expiration
   - Monitor which photos clients view and favorite
   - This feature is vital because timely gallery delivery with proper tracking enhances client satisfaction while providing valuable data on client preferences that can inform sales opportunities.

4. **Print Sales Follow-Up Based on Gallery Engagement**
   - Analyze client gallery browsing patterns to identify print sale opportunities
   - Create targeted follow-up emails highlighting favorited or frequently viewed images
   - Send strategically timed discount offers or package promotions
   - Track conversion rates from follow-up emails to print orders
   - This feature is crucial because strategic, well-timed follow-ups based on actual client behavior dramatically increase print sales revenue, often doubling or tripling post-event income.

5. **Seasonal Promotion Scheduling for Booking Optimization**
   - Schedule promotional email campaigns for traditionally slow booking periods
   - Target past clients with anniversary or seasonal session opportunities
   - Create referral incentive campaigns with tracking
   - Monitor and analyze promotional campaign effectiveness
   - This feature is invaluable because it helps balance the business throughout the year, filling low-season gaps with appropriate promotions while leveraging existing client relationships to generate new business.
