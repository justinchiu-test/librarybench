# PropertyMailFlow - Real Estate Email Automation System

## Overview
PropertyMailFlow is a specialized email automation system designed specifically for independent real estate agents who need to manage high volumes of property-related communications. The system helps agents efficiently respond to property inquiries, organize listings, track client interactions, and measure marketing effectiveness through smart email management and automation.

## Persona Description
Sofia manages listings and client communications for her independent real estate business, handling dozens of property inquiries daily. Her primary goal is to promptly respond to potential buyers and sellers with personalized information while automatically organizing communications by property and client status.

## Key Requirements

1. **Property Listing Template System**
   - Create dynamic email templates for different property types (residential, commercial, rental, etc.)
   - Support for variable field insertion to automatically populate property details (price, square footage, bedrooms, amenities, etc.)
   - Enable batch creation of listing emails for newly acquired properties
   - This feature is critical because it allows Sofia to create professional, consistent property communications in seconds rather than minutes per inquiry, dramatically increasing response speed while maintaining personalization.

2. **Client Follow-up Sequence Automation**
   - Implement time-based follow-up sequences triggered by specific client interactions
   - Allow configuration of different sequence patterns based on client interest level and property type
   - Track which clients have received which sequences and their engagement rate
   - This feature is essential because consistent follow-up is proven to increase conversion rates in real estate, but manual follow-up is time-consuming and prone to being forgotten during busy periods.

3. **Client Categorization and Segmentation System**
   - Implement a tagging system for client emails (buyer/seller, price range, neighborhood preference)
   - Create automated rules to categorize incoming emails based on content analysis
   - Enable search and filtering of communications by category
   - This feature is vital because organizing clients by their specific needs helps Sofia prioritize communications and match the right properties to the right clients quickly.

4. **Listing-Specific Email Organization**
   - Create automatic folder/labeling system for each active property listing
   - Implement intelligent attachment management for property photos and documents
   - Link all communications related to a specific property
   - This feature is crucial because it keeps all communications about a particular property organized in one place, making it easy to find history and track interest in specific listings.

5. **Inquiry Source Tracking and Analytics**
   - Track which marketing channels (websites, platforms, referrals) generate inquiries
   - Generate reports on inquiry-to-showing and showing-to-sale conversion rates by source
   - Provide insights on which marketing channels produce the highest quality leads
   - This feature is invaluable because it helps Sofia optimize her marketing budget by identifying which channels produce the best return on investment.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All email processing rules must be testable with mock email data
- Template rendering must be verifiable with different data combinations
- Client categorization accuracy must be measurable with test datasets
- All analytics calculations must produce consistent, verifiable results
- Storage and retrieval operations must be validated for integrity

### Performance Expectations
- Email rule processing must complete in under 500ms per message
- Template application must render in under 200ms
- The system must handle a minimum of 100 new messages per day with all rules applied
- Search operations must return results in under 1 second
- Analytics reports must generate in under 5 seconds

### Integration Points
- IMAP/SMTP support for connecting to standard email providers

### Key Constraints
- All email content must be securely stored and never shared outside the system
- No client data should be sent to external services without explicit configuration
- The system must function without an active internet connection for core operations
- All operations must be non-blocking to prevent system hangs during email processing
- Storage requirements must not exceed 5GB for a typical installation

## Core Functionality

PropertyMailFlow must provide a comprehensive API for email management focused on real estate operations:

1. **Email Processing Engine**
   - Connect to email accounts via IMAP/SMTP
   - Apply rules to incoming messages based on content and metadata
   - Categorize and organize emails automatically
   - Trigger automated responses and follow-ups based on rules

2. **Template Management System**
   - Create, store, and manage reusable email templates
   - Support variable substitution for personalization
   - Manage property-specific content blocks
   - Handle multimedia content including property images

3. **Client and Property Database**
   - Maintain relationships between clients and properties
   - Store client preferences, history, and status
   - Track property listings, details, and status
   - Link emails to relevant clients and properties

4. **Follow-up Scheduler**
   - Create time-based sequences of communications
   - Track client engagement with previous communications
   - Adjust follow-up timing based on engagement metrics
   - Manage multiple concurrent follow-up sequences

5. **Analytics Engine**
   - Track email metrics (open rates, response rates)
   - Analyze communication patterns and effectiveness
   - Monitor marketing channel performance
   - Generate actionable reports on communication effectiveness

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Email classification accuracy must be >95% for standard inquiries
- Template variable substitution must work correctly in all templates
- Follow-up sequences must trigger at the specified intervals
- Email attachments must be correctly associated with listings
- Marketing source attribution must work for standard referral patterns

### Critical User Scenarios
- A new property listing is created and inquiry emails are automatically responded to
- A potential buyer expresses interest and receives the appropriate follow-up sequence
- A client changes their preferences and their categorization updates accordingly
- Multiple inquiries about the same property are linked in the system
- A marketing campaign's effectiveness is tracked from inquiry to sale

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must handle at least 200 emails per day with full processing
- Search operations must maintain sub-second response with 10,000+ stored emails
- Report generation must complete in <10 seconds with 12 months of data
- Rule processing overhead must not exceed 20% of total email handling time
- Storage efficiency must maintain <1MB per processed email including attachments

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- System must gracefully handle email server connection failures
- Malformed emails must not crash the processing pipeline
- Template rendering must fail gracefully with missing variables
- Duplicate emails must be detected and handled appropriately
- System must recover from interrupted operations without data loss

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Unit test coverage must exceed 90% for all core modules
- Integration tests must verify all system components working together
- Performance tests must validate system under various load conditions
- Boundary tests must verify system behavior with extreme inputs
- Regression tests must preserve functionality across changes
