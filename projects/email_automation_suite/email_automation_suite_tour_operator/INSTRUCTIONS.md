# TourMailFlow - Local Tour Operation Email Management System

## Overview
TourMailFlow is a specialized email automation system designed for local tour operators who need to efficiently manage booking inquiries, pre-tour communications, group management, post-tour feedback, and seasonal promotions. The system streamlines tour operations through intelligent inquiry handling, automated preparation guidance, guest communications, feedback collection, and targeted marketing to maximize bookings and guest satisfaction.

## Persona Description
Raj operates a local tour company handling bookings, inquiries, and guest communications for various tour packages. His primary goal is to convert inquiries into bookings through timely, informative responses while managing pre-tour communications and post-tour follow-ups.

## Key Requirements

1. **Tour Package Inquiry Sorting and Availability Response**
   - Implement automatic classification of inquiries by tour type, date, and group size
   - Check tour availability against booking calendar and capacity limits
   - Generate customized responses with relevant tour details and pricing
   - Track inquiry-to-booking conversion rates by tour type
   - This feature is critical because responding quickly with accurate availability and detailed information significantly increases booking conversion rates, while saving hours of manual calendar checking and response composition.

2. **Booking Confirmation and Pre-Tour Information System**
   - Create comprehensive booking confirmation emails with payment details
   - Send automated pre-tour information sequences with preparation tips
   - Include customized weather forecasts for upcoming tour dates
   - Provide location-specific guidance based on tour type
   - This feature is essential because thorough pre-tour preparation dramatically improves guest experience by ensuring participants arrive properly prepared, while reducing last-minute questions and cancellations due to uncertainty.

3. **Group Management and Multi-Guest Communication**
   - Track and manage communications for tours with multiple participants
   - Support separate communications for booking organizers and participants
   - Coordinate special requirements across group members
   - Enable efficient updates to entire tour groups
   - This feature is vital because many tours involve groups with different participants who need specific information, and managing communications to all members efficiently is critical for guest preparation and satisfaction.

4. **Post-Tour Feedback Collection and Review Automation**
   - Generate customized post-tour feedback requests
   - Track response rates and analyze feedback patterns
   - Create automated review request sequences for popular platforms
   - Send personalized thank-you messages with incentives for future bookings
   - This feature is crucial because guest feedback is essential for tour improvement, and online reviews dramatically impact booking rates, making systematic collection of both critical for business growth.

5. **Seasonal Promotion Scheduling and Performance Analytics**
   - Schedule targeted promotional campaigns based on seasonal booking patterns
   - Create special offers for low-occupancy periods
   - Analyze promotional campaign performance by tour type and season
   - Target previous guests with personalized offerings
   - This feature is invaluable because it helps balance bookings throughout the year, filling low-season gaps with appropriate promotions while leveraging past guest relationships to generate repeat business.
