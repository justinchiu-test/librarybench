# Volunteer Coordinator Email Automation Suite

## Overview
VolunteerMail is a specialized email automation library designed for non-profit volunteer coordinators who manage event communications, volunteer scheduling, and participation tracking with limited administrative resources. It enables efficient volunteer management through automated communications, attendance tracking, and recognition systems, allowing coordinators to focus on community impact rather than administrative tasks.

## Persona Description
Jamal coordinates volunteers for community events at a non-profit organization with limited administrative support. His primary goal is to efficiently manage volunteer schedules and communications while tracking participation and sending personalized appreciation messages.

## Key Requirements

1. **Event-based Email Segmentation System**
   - Create and manage communication templates for different event types with role-specific details
   - Support targeted messaging to specific volunteer segments based on event roles
   - Enable automatic email distribution to appropriate volunteer groups
   - This feature is critical because it ensures volunteers receive only information relevant to their roles, improving communication clarity while reducing confusion and information overload common in volunteer management

2. **Attendance Confirmation and Reminder System**
   - Track volunteer sign-ups and confirmations for scheduled events
   - Generate sequenced reminders at configurable intervals before events
   - Process attendance confirmations and cancellations automatically
   - This feature is essential because it minimizes no-shows by sending timely reminders, tracks expected attendance for planning purposes, and reduces the coordinator's time spent on manual follow-ups

3. **Volunteer Skill and Interest Matching**
   - Maintain a database of volunteer skills, interests, and availability
   - Match volunteers to appropriate opportunities based on their profiles
   - Generate personalized opportunity notifications based on volunteer preferences
   - This feature is vital because it ensures volunteers are matched to roles that utilize their strengths and interests, improving satisfaction and retention while ensuring events have appropriate talent allocation

4. **Service Recognition Message System**
   - Track volunteer participation milestones (number of events, hours contributed)
   - Generate personalized recognition messages at achievement thresholds
   - Manage communication cadence for appreciation messaging
   - This feature is important because volunteer recognition significantly improves retention, and automated milestone tracking ensures no contribution goes unacknowledged, even with limited administrative resources

5. **Post-event Feedback Collection and Analysis**
   - Create and distribute customized post-event feedback forms
   - Process and aggregate feedback responses automatically
   - Generate summary reports of volunteer feedback
   - This feature enhances future events by capturing volunteer insights while demonstrating that their input is valued, and automating the collection process ensures consistent feedback gathering without administrative burden

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All email generation and processing functions must be testable with mock data
- Volunteer matching algorithms must be verifiable with test volunteer profiles
