   - Track client engagement with milestone notifications
   - This feature is critical because it ensures clients remain informed about project progress without requiring manual updates, saving Marcus significant time while maintaining transparent communication.

2. **Support Request Triage and Prioritization**
   - Analyze incoming emails for support request indicators and urgency keywords
   - Categorize requests based on client tier, project phase, and technical complexity
   - Automatically generate appropriate response templates based on request category
   - Queue and prioritize multiple simultaneous support requests
   - This feature is essential because it helps Marcus identify and address the most critical issues first, ensuring efficient client service even during busy periods with overlapping priorities.

3. **Invoice and Payment Tracking System**
   - Create and send automated invoice emails with consistent formatting
   - Track payment status and send configurable reminder sequences
   - Maintain payment history and generate financial reports
   - Integrate with project data to automate billing based on completed work
   - This feature is vital because it ensures consistent and timely billing, improving cash flow and reducing the administrative overhead of payment collection.

4. **Code Snippet and Technical Communication Management**
   - Format and syntax-highlight code snippets in email responses
   - Organize and store reusable technical explanations and code examples
   - Enable easy insertion of properly formatted technical content in emails
   - Ensure code formatting is preserved in different email clients
   - This feature is crucial because it allows Marcus to clearly communicate technical concepts and code examples to clients without spending time on manual formatting.

5. **Meeting Scheduler with Availability Management**
   - Implement automated meeting proposal and scheduling functionality
   - Manage availability templates that protect dedicated development time
   - Handle timezone differences automatically between Marcus and clients
   - Send automated meeting confirmations and reminders
   - This feature is invaluable because it eliminates the time-consuming back-and-forth of meeting scheduling while ensuring meetings don't disrupt critical development periods.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All email processing rules must be testable with mock email data
- Template rendering must be verifiable with different data combinations
- Email classification accuracy must be measurable with test datasets
- All scheduling operations must be verifiable with different timezone scenarios
- Code formatting functionality must be testable with various programming languages

### Performance Expectations
- Email rule processing must complete in under 300ms per message
- Template application must render in under 200ms
- The system must handle at least 200 emails per day with all rules applied
- Code snippet formatting must process at least 500 lines per second
- Meeting availability calculations must complete in under 500ms

### Integration Points
- IMAP/SMTP support for connecting to standard email providers
- Calendar API integration for availability management
- Project management data integration for milestone tracking
- Payment processor webhook capability for automatic payment status updates
- Version control system integration for referencing commits in communications

### Key Constraints
- All client communications must be securely stored with appropriate encryption
- No reliance on external services for core email processing functionality
- The system must function in offline mode for core operations
- All operations must be non-blocking to prevent system hangs
- Storage requirements must not exceed 10GB for a typical installation

## Core Functionality

DevMailFlow must provide a comprehensive API for email management focused on web development business operations:

1. **Email Processing Engine**
   - Connect to email accounts via IMAP/SMTP
   - Apply rules to incoming messages based on content analysis
   - Categorize and organize emails by project, client, and type
   - Trigger automated responses based on email content and context

2. **Project Communication Management**
   - Track project phases and milestone status
   - Generate appropriate notifications based on project events
   - Maintain history of all project-related communications
   - Provide templates for common project communication scenarios

3. **Client and Project Database**
   - Maintain relationships between clients and their projects
   - Store client preferences, history, and service tier
   - Track project details, deadlines, and current status
   - Link emails to relevant clients and projects automatically

4. **Technical Content Handling**
   - Format code snippets with syntax highlighting
   - Manage reusable technical explanation templates
   - Handle various programming languages correctly
   - Ensure proper rendering across different email clients

5. **Scheduling and Availability System**
   - Manage calendar availability and protected time blocks
   - Process meeting requests against availability rules
   - Handle timezone conversions automatically
   - Generate meeting confirmations and calendar invites

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Email classification accuracy must be >90% for common client requests
- Template variable substitution must work correctly in all communication templates
- Code formatting must preserve syntax for at least 5 common programming languages
- Timezone calculations must be accurate for international clients
- Project milestone tracking must correctly trigger appropriate notifications

### Critical User Scenarios
- A client sends a support request that is automatically categorized and prioritized
- A project reaches a milestone and the client receives an appropriate update
- An invoice payment becomes overdue and triggers the reminder sequence
- A client requests a meeting and receives appropriate time options
- A technical explanation with code snippets is formatted and sent to a client

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must handle at least 200 emails per day with full processing
- Search operations must maintain sub-second response with 5,000+ stored emails
- Report generation must complete in <5 seconds with 12 months of data
- Code snippet formatting must handle fragments of at least 1000 lines
- Calendar operations must support at least 100 availability checks per day

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- System must gracefully handle email server connection failures
- Malformed emails or code snippets must not crash the processing pipeline
- Template rendering must fail gracefully with missing project data
- Timezone edge cases (DST transitions, unusual timezones) must be handled correctly
- The system must recover from interrupted operations without data loss

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Unit test coverage must exceed 90% for all core modules
- Integration tests must verify all system components working together
- Performance tests must validate system under various load conditions
- Boundary tests must verify system behavior with extreme inputs
