# E-commerce Transition Microservices Framework

## Overview
A microservices framework designed specifically for incremental migration from monolithic e-commerce applications to a distributed architecture. This framework enables phased transition with minimal customer impact by supporting hybrid operations, providing resilient order processing, and offering comprehensive visualization and validation capabilities.

## Persona Description
Sophia leads architecture for a mid-sized online retailer transitioning from a monolithic application to microservices. Her primary goal is to design a resilient event-driven architecture that allows for incremental migration without disrupting the customer shopping experience during the transition.

## Key Requirements

1. **Hybrid Architecture Support with Bridge Patterns**
   - Implement communication bridges between the monolith and new microservices components
   - Create adapters that translate between legacy synchronous calls and event-based communication
   - This feature is critical for Sophia as it allows gradual migration without a high-risk "big bang" cutover, enabling business continuity while modernizing the architecture

2. **Incremental Migration Tooling with Event Replay Capabilities**
   - Develop event persistence and playback mechanisms to synchronize state during migration
   - Create tools for validating data consistency between legacy and new systems
   - This capability allows Sophia to move specific business functions to microservices one at a time while maintaining data integrity, reducing risk and providing confidence in each migration step

3. **Order Processing Saga Management with Compensation Transactions**
   - Implement a saga orchestration pattern for managing distributed order processing workflows
   - Create compensation transaction handlers for rolling back partial operations in failure scenarios
   - This feature ensures customer orders remain consistent even when spanning both legacy and new systems, preventing half-completed transactions that could damage customer trust

4. **Transaction Boundary Visualization Showing Service Dependencies**
   - Develop tools to map and visualize transaction flows across service boundaries
   - Create dependency analysis to identify critical paths and potential bottlenecks
   - This capability provides Sophia with insight into complex distributed operations, helping identify risk areas and optimize migration sequencing

5. **A/B Deployment Capability for Validating New Service Implementations**
   - Implement traffic routing mechanisms that can direct subsets of transactions to new services
   - Create comparison tools for validating outputs between legacy and new implementations
   - This feature enables Sophia to validate new service implementations with real traffic before full cutover, reducing risk and providing stakeholders with confidence in the migration

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must support side-by-side testing of legacy and new implementations
- Saga workflows must be testable with injected failure conditions at each step
- Bridge components must be testable with simulated monolith and microservice behaviors
- Event replay mechanisms must be verifiable for completeness and correctness
- Comparison utilities must identify and report differences in behavior between implementations

### Performance Expectations
- Bridge components must add no more than 50ms of latency to operations
- Event capture and replay must handle the peak transaction rate of the system (minimum 100 transactions per second)
- Saga coordination must complete within 3 seconds for typical workflows
- Visualization tools must process and display transaction maps within 5 seconds
- A/B deployment switches must transition traffic without perceptible customer delay

### Integration Points
- Adapters for interfacing with the monolithic application's APIs
- Event bus integration for communication between new microservices
- Data store adapters for both legacy and new persistence mechanisms
- Monitoring system hooks for operational visibility
- Feature flag system for A/B deployment control

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without requiring significant changes to the existing monolith
- Must preserve customer session state across legacy and new components
- Should minimize additional infrastructure requirements during transition
- Must support rollback capabilities for each microservice migration
- All operational changes must be transparent to customers

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Event-Driven Communication Framework**
   - Reliable event publishing and subscription mechanisms
   - Event schema versioning and compatibility management
   - Event persistence with replay capabilities

2. **Monolith-to-Microservice Bridge Components**
   - Synchronous-to-asynchronous communication adapters
   - Legacy API proxying with event transformation
   - Dual-write capabilities for data migration periods

3. **Saga Orchestration Engine**
   - Distributed transaction coordination
   - Compensation transaction management
   - State management across workflow steps

4. **Transaction Analysis and Visualization**
   - Transaction flow tracking and recording
   - Service dependency analysis
   - Performance and bottleneck identification

5. **A/B Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Request routing based on configurable rules
   - Output comparison and validation
   - Gradual traffic shifting capabilities

6. **Migration Validation Tooling**
   - Data consistency verification
   - Behavior conformance testing
   - Performance comparison metrics

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified
- Bridge components correctly translate between synchronous and event-driven communication
- Event replay accurately reconstructs system state after interruptions
- Saga orchestration correctly manages distributed transactions including failure scenarios
- Transaction visualization accurately represents system dependencies
- A/B deployment correctly routes traffic and compares implementations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Customer places order that spans legacy and new services
- Microservice fails during a distributed transaction and triggers compensation
- System recovers from an outage using event replay
- Architect visualizes transaction boundaries to plan the next migration
- New implementation is validated through A/B testing before full cutover

### Performance Benchmarks
- Bridge components handle peak load without significant latency increase
- Event replay restores system state within recovery time objective
- Saga processing completes within defined service level objectives
- Visualization tools present results within interactive timeframes
- A/B deployment transitions maintain response time requirements

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Partial failures during distributed transactions
- Version conflicts in event schemas during migration
- Inconsistent states between legacy and new systems
- Circular dependencies between services
- Backward compatibility issues with event consumers

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of compensation transaction logic
- All error handling paths explicitly tested
- All bridge communication patterns verified
- Complete validation of event replay consistency

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Zero customer-facing disruptions during microservice migrations
- Order processing maintains 99.9% reliability across hybrid architecture
- Failed transactions are correctly compensated with no orphaned operations
- Architects can identify all cross-service dependencies for any transaction
- New service implementations validated through A/B testing show equivalent or better performance
- Migration times reduced by 50% compared to traditional approaches
- Each migrated component can be independently verified for correctness
- System can recover from failures with no data loss or inconsistency

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment for this project:

1. Initialize the project using `uv`:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`

3. Run tests using `uv run pytest`

4. To execute specific Python scripts:
   ```
   uv run python your_script.py
   ```

5. For running linters and type checking:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to design the framework as a library with well-documented APIs, not as an application with user interfaces. All functionality should be exposed through programmatic interfaces that can be easily tested and integrated into larger systems.
