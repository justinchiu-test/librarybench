# E-commerce Transition Microservices Framework

## Overview
A specialized event-driven microservices framework designed to support the incremental migration of a monolithic e-commerce platform to a microservices architecture without disrupting customer experience. The framework provides specific capabilities for managing the transition phase, including bridge patterns between old and new components, event replay for system validation, and tools for managing complex order processing flows.

## Persona Description
Sophia leads architecture for a mid-sized online retailer transitioning from a monolithic application to microservices. Her primary goal is to design a resilient event-driven architecture that allows for incremental migration without disrupting the customer shopping experience during the transition.

## Key Requirements

1. **Hybrid Architecture Support with Bridge Patterns**
   - Implementation of bridge adapters that allow communication between monolithic components and new microservices
   - Two-way event translation layer that maps legacy events to new event schemas and vice versa
   - Compatibility layer for data format transformation between systems
   - Monitoring for bridge component performance and reliability
   - This is critical for Sophia as it enables incremental migration without requiring a complete system rewrite at once

2. **Incremental Migration Tooling with Event Replay Capabilities**
   - Event capture mechanism to record production events from the monolith
   - Event replay system to test new microservice implementations against real-world data patterns
   - Comparison utilities to validate identical behavior between old and new implementations
   - Comprehensive logging for identifying behavior differences during migration
   - This enables Sophia to validate new microservices with production data before going live, reducing migration risk

3. **Order Processing Saga Management with Compensation Transactions**
   - Implementation of the saga pattern for distributed order processing transactions
   - Coordination of multi-step business processes across services (inventory, payment, shipping)
   - Compensation transaction management for handling failures at any step in the process
   - Timeout and retry mechanisms for resilient order processing
   - This ensures order integrity during processing even when parts of the system are being migrated

4. **Transaction Boundary Visualization Showing Service Dependencies**
   - Creation of a dependency graph that shows service relationships and transaction boundaries
   - Real-time visualization of event flows between services
   - Identification of critical paths and potential failure points
   - Service boundary analysis for optimizing domain decomposition
   - This helps Sophia understand and communicate the impact of architecture changes to stakeholders

5. **A/B Deployment Capability for Validating New Service Implementations**
   - Traffic splitting mechanism to route a percentage of requests to new service implementations
   - Real-time comparison of performance and behavior between old and new implementations
   - Automated rollback capability if new services fail to meet performance or correctness criteria
   - Gradual transition support with configurable traffic routing rules
   - This allows Sophia to safely test new microservice implementations with real users before fully committing

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with minimum 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must cover all service interaction points
- Event replay tests must validate both functional correctness and performance
- A/B testing functions must be testable without affecting production systems
- Mock implementations of all external dependencies for isolated testing

### Performance Expectations
- Bridge pattern overhead should not exceed 10ms per transaction
- Event replay system must handle at least 10x real-time event rates for accelerated testing
- Saga pattern implementation must support at least 1000 concurrent order processes
- System must maintain the same or better response times compared to the monolithic system
- Visualization components must update in near real-time with less than 5-second latency

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing monolithic architecture components
- Standardized interfaces for connecting new microservices
- Event schema registry for maintaining compatibility across versions
- Monitoring system integration for observability
- Database integration supports both legacy and new storage systems

### Key Constraints
- Zero downtime during migration phases
- Backward compatibility with existing clients and third-party integrations
- Must function without requiring changes to the existing monolith's core code
- Resource efficiency to prevent significant infrastructure cost increases during transition
- Secure by design with no compromise on data protection during transition

## Core Functionality

The E-commerce Transition Microservices Framework must provide:

1. **Event Bus Implementation**
   - A message broker system supporting publish-subscribe patterns
   - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous messaging
   - Message persistence for reliability and replay capabilities
   - Event routing with filtering capabilities
   - Event schema validation and versioning

2. **Bridge Components**
   - Two-way adapters connecting monolith and microservices
   - Event translation between different schemas and formats
   - Performance monitoring for bridge components
   - Graceful degradation if either side becomes unavailable

3. **Saga Pattern Implementation**
   - Coordinator service for managing distributed transactions
   - Step-by-step transaction orchestration
   - Compensation transaction handling for rollback scenarios
   - Timeout management and retry logic
   - Transaction state persistence for recovery

4. **Visualization and Monitoring**
   - Dependency graph visualization tool
   - Real-time event flow monitoring
   - Performance metrics collection and analysis
   - Alert system for anomalies and failures

5. **A/B Testing Infrastructure**
   - Traffic distribution controls
   - Performance and behavior comparison tools
   - Automated rollback mechanisms
   - Gradual transition capability with configurable rules

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Event publication and subscription between all system components
- Successful event translation between legacy and new formats
- Complete saga execution with all success and failure scenarios
- Accurate dependency visualization reflecting actual system structure
- Proper traffic distribution in A/B testing scenarios

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete order processing flow across monolith and microservices components
- Handling of peak traffic scenarios (e.g., sales events)
- System behavior during partial outages of either monolith or microservices
- Rollback scenarios when new service implementations fail
- Incremental migration of a service from monolith to microservices

### Performance Benchmarks
- Latency in hybrid architecture must remain within 5% of original monolith
- System must handle peak load of at least 200 orders per second
- Event replay must process at least 10x real-time event rates
- A/B deployment must handle traffic splitting without performance degradation
- Visualization tools must update within 5 seconds of events occurring

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitions between monolith and microservices
- Database failures during critical transactions
- Message broker outages
- Incomplete or corrupted event data
- Version incompatibilities between services

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of error handling paths
- All API endpoints must have integration tests
- Performance tests must cover both average and peak load scenarios
- Security tests must validate proper isolation between tenants

## Success Criteria
- Zero customer-facing disruptions during migration phases
- Successful incremental migration of at least three critical services from monolith to microservices
- Order processing maintains 99.99% success rate during migration
- Development teams can independently deploy new microservices without coordinating with monolith team
- System maintains or improves on previous performance metrics for customer-facing operations
- Clear visualization of service boundaries leads to better architecture decisions
