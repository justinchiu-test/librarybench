# E-commerce Transition Microservices Framework

## Overview
This project is a specialized event-driven microservices framework designed to facilitate the incremental migration of an e-commerce platform from a monolithic architecture to microservices. It focuses on maintaining business continuity during the transition, providing bridge patterns between old and new systems, and ensuring a seamless customer experience throughout the migration process.

## Persona Description
Sophia leads architecture for a mid-sized online retailer transitioning from a monolithic application to microservices. Her primary goal is to design a resilient event-driven architecture that allows for incremental migration without disrupting the customer shopping experience during the transition.

## Key Requirements

1. **Hybrid Architecture Support with Bridge Patterns**
   - Implement adapter patterns that allow the monolith and microservices to communicate seamlessly
   - Create event translation layers that map between legacy data models and new service models
   - Provide bidirectional communication channels between monolith and microservices components
   - This feature is critical as it allows for incremental migration without rebuilding the entire system at once

2. **Incremental Migration Tooling with Event Replay**
   - Develop event capture mechanisms that record interactions with the monolith for testing microservices
   - Create event replay functionality to validate that new microservices behave identically to monolith components
   - Include data migration utilities that help move from monolithic databases to service-specific data stores
   - This feature is essential to verify correctness of new services before cutting over from legacy implementations

3. **Order Processing Saga Management with Compensation Transactions**
   - Implement the saga pattern for order processing workflows spanning multiple services
   - Create compensation transaction mechanisms to handle failures in the distributed process
   - Support long-running transactions that may span hours or days in the order fulfillment process
   - This feature ensures order integrity across services during the transition when some components may still be in the monolith

4. **Transaction Boundary Visualization**
   - Create tools to map and visualize service dependencies and transaction boundaries
   - Identify potential consistency issues across service boundaries
   - Highlight critical paths in customer-facing transactions
   - This feature helps architects understand the implications of splitting certain functions into separate services

5. **A/B Deployment Capability for Validating New Implementations**
   - Support parallel running of legacy and new implementations of the same functionality
   - Provide traffic splitting mechanisms to route a percentage of transactions to new services
   - Include comparison tools to validate that results from both implementations match
   - This feature allows for risk mitigation by testing new services with actual production traffic in a controlled manner

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be individually testable with pytest
- Service interactions must support mocking for isolated testing
- Event flows must be traceable and reproducible in test environments
- Provide simulation tools for various migration scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Support for processing at least 1,000 orders per minute
- Maximum event latency of 500ms between services
- Support for at least 100 concurrent service instances
- Migration tooling must handle historical data sets of at least 1 million orders

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with SQL and NoSQL databases used by the monolith
- Support for common e-commerce payment and shipping provider APIs
- Integration with existing authentication and authorization systems
- Compatibility with popular monitoring and logging solutions

### Key Constraints
- Must support running in both cloud and on-premises environments
- Cannot require changes to customer-facing components during the migration
- Must operate without service interruption during deployment of new services
- Must maintain full audit trail of all transactions during the migration process

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Event Bus and Message Routing**
   - Publish-subscribe mechanism for inter-service communication
   - Support for different message types (commands, events, queries)
   - Message routing based on content and context
   - Support for routing between monolith and microservices

2. **Service Registry and Discovery**
   - Dynamic service registration and discovery
   - Health monitoring of services
   - Version management for services
   - Support for gradual service transition

3. **Migration Support Tools**
   - Event capture and replay functionality
   - Data consistency verification between old and new implementations
   - Transaction simulation for testing new services
   - Rollback mechanisms if new services fail

4. **Transaction Management**
   - Implementation of the saga pattern for distributed transactions
   - Compensation mechanisms for failed transactions
   - Transaction monitoring and visualization
   - Support for long-running business processes

5. **Deployment and Testing Infrastructure**
   - A/B testing capabilities for new service implementations
   - Traffic splitting and routing
   - Performance comparison between old and new implementations
   - Gradual cutover support from monolith to microservices

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities that Must be Verified
- Event propagation between monolith and microservices components
- Correct implementation of the saga pattern for order processing
- Successful execution of compensation transactions on failure
- Accuracy of A/B deployment comparisons
- Correctness of incremental migration with data consistency

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete order processing flow from cart to shipment
- Handling of partial failures in the order process
- Migration of a component from monolith to microservice
- Rollback of a failed migration
- A/B testing of a new service implementation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process 1,000 orders per minute with latency under 500ms
- Support 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation
- Handle replay of 100,000 historical events for service validation
- Complete migration data verification within 4 hours for 1 million records

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitions between services
- Partial system failures during order processing
- Inconsistent data states between monolith and microservices
- Version mismatch between communicating services
- Replay of invalid or corrupt event data

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all code
- 100% coverage of critical paths in order processing saga
- 100% coverage of failure scenarios and compensation transactions
- 100% coverage of migration tooling functionality

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All components of the framework can be tested individually and in integration
2. The system demonstrates the ability to process orders spanning both monolith and microservices components
3. The migration tooling successfully validates new service implementations against monolith behavior
4. The system can perform A/B testing between old and new implementations
5. Transaction boundaries are correctly visualized and maintained during migration
6. Performance meets the specified benchmarks under load
7. All test cases pass with the required coverage

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

### Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the project in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Install test dependencies
uv pip install pytest pytest-json-report

# Run tests and generate the required JSON report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

CRITICAL: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a mandatory requirement for project completion. This file serves as evidence that all functionality has been implemented correctly and passes all tests.
