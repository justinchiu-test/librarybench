# Financial Transaction Microservices Framework

## Overview
A highly reliable event-driven microservices framework designed specifically for financial systems processing thousands of transactions per second with strict data consistency guarantees and comprehensive audit capabilities. The framework ensures regulatory compliance while providing the performance, security, and traceability required in financial technology applications.

## Persona Description
Marcus oversees development at a financial technology company processing thousands of transactions per second. His primary goal is to implement a microservices architecture that maintains strict data consistency while providing the regulatory audit trail required in financial systems.

## Key Requirements

1. **Exactly-once Event Delivery Guarantees with Transaction Idempotence**
   - Implementation of idempotent message processing to prevent duplicate transaction processing
   - Unique transaction ID generation and tracking across distributed services
   - Message deduplication mechanisms at both sending and receiving ends
   - Distributed transaction coordination with atomicity guarantees
   - This is critical for Marcus as financial systems cannot tolerate double-processing of transactions, which could lead to accounting errors and financial losses

2. **Comprehensive Event Logging with Immutable Audit Capabilities**
   - Tamper-proof event logging for all financial transactions
   - Cryptographic verification of event log integrity
   - Retention policy management compliant with financial regulations
   - Secure, searchable audit trail accessible for compliance reviews
   - This enables Marcus to meet regulatory requirements for financial systems which mandate complete, immutable transaction records

3. **Circuit Breaker Patterns with Progressive Service Degradation**
   - Implementation of the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Configurable failure thresholds for circuit tripping
   - Fallback mechanisms to maintain critical functionality during outages
   - Progressive service degradation to prioritize essential financial operations
   - This ensures that the financial system remains operational even during partial outages, protecting core transaction processing

4. **Event Sourcing with Compliant Storage Regulations for Financial Data**
   - Event sourcing implementation for all financial transactions
   - Secure, compliant storage of event streams meeting financial regulations
   - Event replay capabilities for system reconstruction and auditing
   - Data retention and privacy controls aligned with regulatory requirements
   - This provides Marcus with a complete history of all state changes, critical for financial reconciliation and regulatory compliance

5. **Service Authorization Mechanisms with Fine-grained Access Control**
   - Service-to-service authentication and authorization
   - Role-based access control for all service operations
   - Fine-grained permission system for financial data access
   - Comprehensive access logging for security audits
   - This ensures that only authorized services and personnel can access sensitive financial data, an essential requirement in financial systems

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with minimum 95% code coverage
- Integration tests must cover all cross-service transaction flows
- Performance tests must validate throughput of at least 2000 transactions per second
- Security tests must validate all authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Chaos testing must validate system behavior during various failure scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- System must process a minimum of 2000 financial transactions per second
- 99.99% of transactions must complete within 200ms
- Event logging must not add more than 10ms overhead to transaction processing
- Circuit breaker decisions must be made within 50ms to prevent cascading failures
- System must recover from failure states within 30 seconds

### Integration Points
- Secure integration with existing financial systems and payment processors
- Standardized interfaces for regulatory reporting systems
- Integration with authentication and identity management systems
- Monitoring and alerting systems integration
- Backup and disaster recovery systems

### Key Constraints
- Must comply with financial industry regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS, SOX, GDPR)
- Zero data loss guarantee for financial transactions
- Strong consistency requirements for financial data
- Encryption for all data at rest and in transit
- Multi-region deployment support for disaster recovery

## Core Functionality

The Financial Transaction Microservices Framework must provide:

1. **Transaction Processing Engine**
   - High-throughput event processing for financial transactions
   - Idempotent operation processing to prevent duplicates
   - Transaction correlation across multiple services
   - Distributed transaction coordination

2. **Secure Audit Logging System**
   - Cryptographically verified transaction logs
   - Immutable storage for audit records
   - Compliant retention and archiving mechanisms
   - Secure query capabilities for audit investigations

3. **Resilience Infrastructure**
   - Circuit breaker implementation for fault isolation
   - Health monitoring for all service components
   - Fallback mechanism configuration and management
   - Automatic recovery procedures

4. **Event Sourcing System**
   - Event store for all transaction events
   - Event replay capabilities for system reconstruction
   - Compliance with financial data regulations
   - Projections for different views of financial data

5. **Authorization Framework**
   - Service-to-service authentication
   - Fine-grained permission management
   - Role-based access control
   - Comprehensive access logging

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- End-to-end financial transaction processing with idempotence guarantees
- Audit log integrity and immutability
- Circuit breaker operation under various failure conditions
- Event sourcing capabilities including correct event replay
- Access control enforcement for all protected operations

### Critical User Scenarios
- High-volume payment processing with concurrent transactions
- Financial reconciliation using audit logs and event replay
- System behavior during partial service outages
- Regulatory compliance reporting using stored event data
- Access control for different user and service roles

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must maintain 2000 TPS with 99.99% of transactions completing within 200ms
- Audit logging must not reduce transaction throughput by more than 5%
- Circuit breakers must make decisions within 50ms of detecting issues
- Event sourcing must support replay at minimum 5x real-time speed
- Authorization checks must add no more than, 5ms overhead per request

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitions between services during critical financial transactions
- Database failures during transaction processing
- Corrupted or invalid financial messages
- Attempted unauthorized access to financial data
- High-load scenarios exceeding normal capacity

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of all error handling paths
- All financial transaction flows must have end-to-end tests
- All security mechanisms must have penetration tests
- All regulatory compliance capabilities must have verification tests

## Success Criteria
