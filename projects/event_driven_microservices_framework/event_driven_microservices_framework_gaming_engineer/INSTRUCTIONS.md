# Real-time Gaming Microservices Framework

## Overview
A low-latency event-driven framework optimized for online gaming platforms that handles real-time player interactions across distributed game servers. This framework ensures game state consistency while supporting massive concurrent player actions, maintains session continuity, provides specialized event delivery for spectator modes, and implements distributed validation for anti-cheat protection.

## Persona Description
Carlos develops backend services for an online gaming platform handling real-time player interactions across multiple game worlds. His primary goal is to create a low-latency event system that maintains game state consistency while supporting massive concurrent player actions across distributed game servers.

## Key Requirements

1. **Real-time Event Propagation with Latency-based Routing**
   - Implement optimized event distribution with geographic and network topology awareness
   - Create adaptive routing strategies that prioritize latency-sensitive game events
   - This feature is critical for Carlos as it ensures players experience minimal lag during gameplay interactions, maintaining smooth game experiences across different regions and network conditions

2. **Game State Consistency Patterns with Conflict Resolution**
   - Develop mechanisms for maintaining consistent game state across distributed servers
   - Create conflict resolution strategies that preserve game integrity during concurrent updates
   - This capability allows Carlos to maintain a single consistent game world even when players interact simultaneously from different game servers, preventing exploits, inconsistencies, and unfair advantages

3. **Session Affinity Maintaining Player Connection Continuity**
   - Implement seamless session handover between game servers during scaling or failures
   - Create player connection state preservation during server transitions
   - This feature enables Carlos's platform to maintain uninterrupted player connections during server scaling, maintenance, or failures, preventing disruptive disconnections that damage player experience

4. **Spectator Mode Event Filtering for Optimized Observer Patterns**
   - Develop differentiated event streams for active players versus spectators
   - Create configurable filtering and aggregation for spectator-specific views
   - This capability allows Carlos to support thousands of spectators watching popular matches without overloading game servers or compromising player experience, efficiently delivering appropriate content to each audience

5. **Anti-cheat Verification Through Distributed Event Validation**
   - Implement multi-point validation of critical game events
   - Create anomaly detection for identifying potentially fraudulent actions
   - This feature helps Carlos maintain fair gameplay by identifying and preventing cheating, ensuring the integrity of the gaming experience and maintaining player trust in competitive environments

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with simulated network conditions
- Game state consistency must be verifiable through parallel execution testing
- Session handling must be testable with simulated failures and transitions
- Spectator filtering must be testable with load simulation
- Anti-cheat mechanisms must be testable against known exploitation patterns

### Performance Expectations
- Event propagation latency must not exceed 100ms for critical gameplay actions
- Game state updates must support at least 10,000 concurrent players per game world
- Session transitions must complete within 500ms with no perceptible interruption
- Spectator mode must efficiently support 100,000+ concurrent viewers
- Anti-cheat validation must not add more than 50ms to event processing

### Integration Points
- Integration with game client protocols and SDKs
- Interfaces for game-specific logic and rules engines
- Connection with player authentication and account systems
- Interfaces for matchmaking and game instance management
- Integration with analytics and reporting systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate within latency budget critical for real-time gaming
- Should scale horizontally to support massive multiplayer scenarios
- Must be resilient against varied and challenging network conditions
- Should minimize resource overhead on game servers
- Must operate reliably under unpredictable load spikes

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Real-time Event Distribution**
   - Low-latency event publication and subscription
   - Prioritized event delivery based on gameplay criticality
   - Geographic and network-aware routing optimization

2. **Distributed Game State Management**
   - Consistent state representation across servers
   - Conflict detection and resolution strategies
   - Optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control options

3. **Player Session Management**
   - Session state persistence and migration
   - Seamless server transition without disconnection
   - Session metadata synchronization

4. **Spectator Support System**
   - Filtered event streams for observers
   - Event aggregation for spectator views
   - Bandwidth-optimized delivery for large audiences

5. **Anti-cheat Framework**
   - Distributed validation of critical game actions
   - Temporal and logical consistency checking
   - Anomaly detection for suspicious patterns

6. **Game Platform Integration**
   - Game-agnostic core with game-specific extension points
   - Standardized interfaces for game server integration
   - Customizable event schemas for different game types

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified
- Event delivery meets latency requirements under various network conditions
- Game state remains consistent across servers during concurrent interactions
- Player sessions transition seamlessly between servers without disruption
- Spectator mode efficiently handles large viewer numbers with appropriate filtering
- Anti-cheat mechanisms detect common exploitation attempts

### Critical User Scenarios
- Player actions correctly affect game state for all participants with minimal delay
- Simultaneous conflicting actions by multiple players resolve consistently
- Player maintains connection during server scaling or failover
- Thousands of spectators observe a popular match without affecting player experience
- Attempted cheating is detected and prevented in real-time

### Performance Benchmarks
- System handles specified concurrent player counts with stable performance
- Event delivery latency remains within defined thresholds
- Session transitions complete within specified timeframes
- Spectator mode efficiently scales to target viewer counts
- System resources scale linearly with player and spectator load

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitions between game servers
- Flash crowds during popular events
- Client-side manipulation attempts
- Partial system failures during peak usage
- Extreme latency variations between players

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of event propagation and routing logic
- 100% coverage of state consistency and conflict resolution
- Complete testing of session transition scenarios
- Full verification of spectator filtering mechanisms
- Comprehensive testing of anti-cheat validation logic

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Event propagation latency consistently meets target thresholds in production
- Game state remains consistent across all servers despite concurrent activity
- No player disconnections occur during normal server transitions
- Spectator mode supports peak viewership with minimal resource overhead
- Cheating attempts are consistently detected and prevented
- System scales to support target player concurrency with predictable resource usage
- Players report high satisfaction with game responsiveness and fairness
- Development teams can easily integrate new game types with the framework

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment for this project:

1. Initialize the project using `uv`:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`

3. Run tests using `uv run pytest`

4. To execute specific Python scripts:
   ```
   uv run python your_script.py
   ```

5. For running linters and type checking:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to design the framework as a library with well-documented APIs, not as an application with user interfaces. All functionality should be exposed through programmatic interfaces that can be easily tested and integrated into larger systems.
