# Real-time Gaming Microservices Framework

## Overview
This project is a specialized event-driven microservices framework designed for online gaming platforms that require low-latency, high-concurrency event processing. It provides real-time event propagation, game state consistency management, session affinity, spectator support, and distributed validation to create a responsive, cheat-resistant gaming experience across distributed servers.

## Persona Description
Carlos develops backend services for an online gaming platform handling real-time player interactions across multiple game worlds. His primary goal is to create a low-latency event system that maintains game state consistency while supporting massive concurrent player actions across distributed game servers.

## Key Requirements

1. **Real-time Event Propagation with Latency-based Routing**
   - Implement real-time event distribution with latency optimizations
   - Create dynamic routing based on network latency measurements
   - Support for regional sharding with inter-region synchronization
   - Include prioritization of game-critical events over secondary updates
   - This feature is critical for creating responsive multiplayer experiences with minimal perceived lag

2. **Game State Consistency Patterns with Conflict Resolution**
   - Develop optimistic concurrency for game state updates
   - Create conflict resolution strategies for simultaneous player actions
   - Support for eventual consistency with seamless player experience
   - Include state reconciliation mechanisms when divergence occurs
   - This feature ensures that all players have a consistent view of the game world despite network delays

3. **Session Affinity Maintaining Player Connection Continuity**
   - Implement player session tracking across multiple services
   - Create seamless session transfer between game servers
   - Support for session recovery after disconnections
   - Include session state persistence for critical player data
   - This feature preserves player experience during server transitions or network interruptions

4. **Spectator Mode Event Filtering for Optimized Observer Patterns**
   - Develop event filtering for spectator views of game activities
   - Create bandwidth-optimized event streams for spectators
   - Support for time-delayed spectating with replay capabilities
   - Include spectator-specific state aggregation
   - This feature enables efficient spectator experiences without impacting active player performance

5. **Anti-cheat Verification through Distributed Event Validation**
   - Implement distributed validation of player actions
   - Create anomaly detection for impossible game actions
   - Support for secure event verification across server boundaries
   - Include tamper-evident event logs for post-game analysis
   - This feature maintains game integrity by detecting and preventing cheating in a distributed environment

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Support for simulating high-concurrency player actions
- Ability to test under various network latency conditions
- Testing of conflict resolution scenarios
- Verification of anti-cheat mechanisms

### Performance Expectations
- Maximum event propagation latency of 50ms for critical game actions
- Support for at least 10,000 concurrent players per game world
- Ability to process 100,000+ game events per second
- Support for 1,000+ spectators without impact on player experience

### Integration Points
- Integration with game client communication protocols (WebSockets, UDP)
- Support for game authentication and player identity systems
- Compatibility with existing game state persistence mechanisms
- Integration with analytics platforms for game telemetry

### Key Constraints
- Must operate within strict latency requirements for real-time gameplay
- Must scale horizontally to support massive concurrent player counts
- Must ensure fair play through distributed validation
- Must handle unreliable network conditions gracefully

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Real-time Event Distribution System**
   - Low-latency event propagation
   - Latency-based routing and optimization
   - Regional sharding with synchronization
   - Event prioritization and sequencing

2. **Game State Management**
   - Distributed state synchronization
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - State reconciliation mechanisms
   - Optimistic concurrency control

3. **Session and Connection Management**
   - Player session tracking and persistence
   - Server affinity and load balancing
   - Reconnection and recovery mechanisms
   - Seamless server transitions

4. **Spectator and Observer Support**
   - Filtered event streams for spectators
   - Bandwidth optimization for non-players
   - Time-delayed viewing capabilities
   - Spectator-specific state aggregation

5. **Security and Anti-cheat System**
   - Distributed action validation
   - Anomaly detection for suspicious behavior
   - Secure event verification
   - Tamper-evident logging

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities that Must be Verified
- Event propagation under various network conditions
- Game state consistency with concurrent player actions
- Session continuity during server transitions
- Spectator mode performance and accuracy
- Effectiveness of anti-cheat validation

### Critical User Scenarios
- Massive multiplayer battles with hundreds of simultaneous actions
- Server transitions during active gameplay
- Player disconnection and reconnection
- High-volume spectator viewership of popular matches
- Detection and prevention of cheating attempts

### Performance Benchmarks
- Maintain event propagation latency under 50ms at P99
- Process 100,000+ game events per second
- Support 10,000+ concurrent players in a single game world
- Handle 1,000+ spectators with minimal additional resource usage

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extreme network latency spikes
- Regional outages affecting subset of game servers
- Conflict storms with many players acting on same game element
- Sophisticated cheating attempts with distributed coordination
- Massive influx of spectators for unexpected popular events

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all code
- 100% coverage of critical game state consistency logic
- 100% coverage of anti-cheat validation mechanisms
- 100% coverage of session management and recovery

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Game events propagate with low latency across distributed servers
2. Game state remains consistent despite concurrent player actions
3. Player sessions maintain continuity during server transitions
4. Spectator mode provides efficient observation without impacting gameplay
5. Anti-cheat mechanisms effectively validate player actions
6. Performance meets the specified benchmarks under load
7. All test cases pass with the required coverage

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

### Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the project in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Install test dependencies
uv pip install pytest pytest-json-report

# Run tests and generate the required JSON report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

CRITICAL: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a mandatory requirement for project completion. This file serves as evidence that all functionality has been implemented correctly and passes all tests.
