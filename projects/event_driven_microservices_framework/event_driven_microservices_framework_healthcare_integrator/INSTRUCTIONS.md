# Healthcare Compliant Microservices Integration Framework

## Overview
A secure and compliant microservices framework designed for healthcare systems integration, enabling the safe and efficient flow of protected health information (PHI) between departments and systems. This framework ensures patient data privacy, implements consent-based sharing, provides emergency override capabilities, enforces regulatory compliance, and maintains data integrity across healthcare systems.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen coordinates integration between various healthcare systems in a hospital network where patient data must flow securely between services. Her primary goal is to implement a compliant microservices framework that ensures patient data privacy while enabling critical information sharing between departments and systems.

## Key Requirements

1. **PHI (Protected Health Information) Data Handling with Field-level Encryption**
   - Implement granular encryption for sensitive health information fields
   - Create data classification and handling policies based on PHI sensitivity levels
   - This feature is critical for Dr. Chen as it ensures patient data is protected at a granular level, allowing selective sharing of information while maintaining privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations such as HIPAA

2. **Consent-based Information Sharing with Patient-specific Routing Rules**
   - Develop a patient consent management system with fine-grained authorization rules
   - Create dynamic routing of health information based on documented patient consent
   - This capability allows Dr. Chen to ensure information is only shared according to patient wishes and legal requirements, maintaining both regulatory compliance and patient trust while enabling necessary clinical data exchange

3. **Emergency Override Patterns with Security Audit Logging**
   - Implement emergency access mechanisms for urgent clinical situations
   - Create comprehensive audit logging of all emergency overrides with justification
   - This feature enables Dr. Chen's systems to maintain security while allowing critical access in emergency situations where patient care is the priority, balancing privacy with clinical needs while maintaining accountability

4. **Regulatory Compliance Validation for Healthcare Data Exchange**
   - Develop compliance verification for data exchanges across system boundaries
   - Create automated validation against healthcare interoperability standards
   - This capability ensures Dr. Chen's integration solutions remain compliant with healthcare regulations and standards like HIPAA, HL7 FHIR, and regional privacy laws, reducing legal and regulatory risks

5. **System of Record Designation with Authoritative Data Sourcing**
   - Implement source of truth designation for different categories of healthcare data
   - Create conflict resolution strategies when duplicate or conflicting data exists
   - This feature ensures Dr. Chen's integrated systems maintain data integrity by clearly identifying authoritative sources for different types of medical information, preventing dangerous inconsistencies in patient records

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All PHI handling mechanisms must be verifiable through security testing
- Consent management must be thoroughly testable with various patient scenarios
- Emergency access patterns must be testable without exposing real patient data
- Compliance validation must be testable against industry standard examples
- Authoritative data sourcing must be verifiable through data integrity tests

### Performance Expectations
- PHI field encryption/decryption must complete within 50ms per operation
- Consent verification must not add more than 100ms latency to data access
- Emergency override must activate within 2 seconds in urgent scenarios
- Compliance validation must complete within 200ms per data exchange
- System of record resolution must occur within 100ms when conflicts exist

### Integration Points
- Integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems
- Interfaces for medical imaging and laboratory systems
- Connections to pharmacy and medication management systems
- Integration with patient portal and consent management systems
- Interface with healthcare industry standard protocols (HL7, FHIR, DICOM)

### Key Constraints
- Must comply with healthcare data privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- Must support healthcare interoperability standards (HL7 FHIR, etc.)
- Should operate within existing healthcare IT infrastructure
- Must provide comprehensive audit trails for all PHI access
- Must accommodate complex clinical workflows with minimal disruption

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Healthcare Data Security**
   - Field-level encryption for PHI elements
   - Data tokenization for sensitive identifiers
   - Security classification and handling enforcement

2. **Patient Consent Management**
   - Consent rules engine and evaluation
   - Patient-specific data sharing policies
   - Consent verification and enforcement

3. **Clinical Data Exchange**
   - Healthcare message transformation and normalization
   - Clinical terminology mapping and translation
   - Diagnostic code standardization

4. **Emergency Access Control**
   - Break-glass emergency access protocol
   - Justification capture and verification
   - Comprehensive access audit logging

5. **Healthcare Compliance Framework**
   - Regulatory rule checking and validation
   - Compliance attestation and documentation
   - Standard healthcare message format support

6. **Medical Data Integrity**
   - Authoritative source designation
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Data provenance tracking

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified
- PHI is properly encrypted and protected during all operations
- Information sharing correctly follows patient consent rules
- Emergency override functions are accessible when needed but fully audited
- All data exchanges meet regulatory compliance requirements
- System properly identifies and uses authoritative data sources

### Critical User Scenarios
- Patient data is securely shared between emergency room and radiology
- Patient revokes consent for sharing with specific department
- Clinician requires emergency access to information during urgent care
- New regulatory requirement is implemented and validated
- Conflicting patient information is detected and resolved using authoritative source

### Performance Benchmarks
- System handles typical hospital data volumes (50+ transactions per second)
- Response times for clinical data requests remain under 500ms
- Emergency access is granted within SLA timeframes
- Batch data synchronization completes within maintenance windows
- System scales to support enterprise healthcare organization size

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Incomplete or missing patient consent information
- System outages during critical care scenarios
- Conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions
- Degraded operation during network connectivity issues
- Recovery from data synchronization failures

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of PHI handling and encryption logic
- 100% coverage of consent evaluation and enforcement
- Complete testing of emergency override scenarios and audit logging
- Full verification of compliance validation rules
- Comprehensive testing of conflict resolution logic

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Zero PHI data breaches or unauthorized disclosures
- 100% compliance with healthcare regulations for data exchange
- Patient consent preferences accurately enforced for all information sharing
- Emergency access available within clinically acceptable timeframes when needed
- All data sharing auditable with complete trail of access and justification
- Authoritative data sources correctly identified and prioritized

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment for this project:

1. Initialize the project using `uv`:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`

3. Run tests using `uv run pytest`

4. To execute specific Python scripts:
   ```
   uv run python your_script.py
   ```

5. For running linters and type checking:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to design the framework as a library with well-documented APIs, not as an application with user interfaces. All functionality should be exposed through programmatic interfaces that can be easily tested and integrated into larger systems.
