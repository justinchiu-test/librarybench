# Scalable Media Streaming Microservices Framework

## Overview
A high-throughput event-driven microservices framework designed specifically for video streaming platforms serving millions of concurrent users. This framework implements advanced backpressure handling, efficient metadata synchronization, viewer experience prioritization, sophisticated caching strategies, and optimized analytics processing to maintain seamless viewing experiences even during extreme usage spikes.

## Persona Description
Olivia designs backend systems for a video streaming service handling millions of concurrent viewers. Her primary goal is to create a microservices framework that efficiently manages content delivery, user preferences, and viewing statistics while maintaining a seamless viewing experience during usage spikes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Backpressure Handling with Graceful Degradation Patterns**
   - Implement load-aware request processing that detects system saturation
   - Create tiered degradation strategies that preserve core viewing experience
   - This feature is critical for Olivia as it enables the platform to handle unexpected traffic spikes without crashing, maintaining availability by intelligently reducing non-essential functionality while preserving the core streaming experience

2. **Content Metadata Synchronization Across Service Boundaries**
   - Develop efficient propagation of content metadata changes across services
   - Create consistency mechanisms for distributed content catalogs
   - This capability ensures Olivia's platform maintains accurate and consistent information about available content across all services, preventing confusing user experiences where metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails) doesn't match actual content

3. **Viewer Experience Prioritization with Tiered Service Levels**
   - Implement resource allocation based on critical user journey steps
   - Create differentiated quality of service for different user activities
   - This feature enables Olivia's system to prioritize the actual video playback experience over less critical functions during high load, ensuring viewers maintain uninterrupted streams even when the system is under pressure

4. **Caching Strategies with Invalidation Event Propagation**
   - Develop distributed caching with intelligent content placement
   - Create efficient cache invalidation that propagates across service boundaries
   - This capability allows Olivia's platform to maximize performance and minimize infrastructure costs through effective caching, while ensuring that when content or metadata changes, all caches are properly updated to prevent stale data

5. **Analytics Event Batching with Real-time and Historical Processing Paths**
   - Implement dual-path processing for viewer analytics events
   - Create adaptive batching based on system load and data importance
   - This feature helps Olivia's platform handle the massive volume of viewer analytics data without affecting the core viewing experience, providing both immediate insights for operational monitoring and complete data for historical analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All backpressure and degradation mechanisms must be testable under simulated load
- Metadata synchronization must be verifiable for consistency and timeliness
- Service prioritization must be testable with resource contention scenarios
- Caching and invalidation must be testable for correctness and performance
- Analytics processing must be verifiable for both real-time and historical accuracy

### Performance Expectations
- Framework must support at least 5 million concurrent streaming sessions
- Metadata changes must propagate to all services within 5 seconds
- Critical viewing functions must remain responsive within 500ms during extreme load
- Cache invalidations must propagate within 2 seconds across the entire system
- Analytics processing must handle 100,000+ events per second without affecting streaming

### Integration Points
- Integration with content delivery networks (CDNs)
- Interfaces for content management systems
- Connections to recommendation engines
- Hooks for billing and subscription services
- Integration with advertising platforms

### Key Constraints
- Must operate efficiently across global regions with varying latency
- Should minimize infrastructure costs through resource optimization
- Must maintain viewing experience quality during unexpected traffic spikes
- Should seamlessly scale both up and down with changing viewer demand
- Must provide accurate analytics while prioritizing viewing experience

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Load Management System**
   - Load detection across distributed services
   - Configurable degradation decision engines
   - Resource allocation prioritization

2. **Content Metadata Management**
   - Distributed metadata synchronization
   - Consistency enforcement mechanisms
   - Change propagation optimization

3. **Service Prioritization Framework**
   - Critical path identification and protection
   - Resource reservation for essential services
   - Dynamic service importance classification

4. **Distributed Caching Infrastructure**
   - Multi-level caching with consistency management
   - Strategic content placement based on popularity
   - Efficient invalidation propagation

5. **Analytics Processing Pipeline**
   - Dual-path event processing (real-time and historical)
   - Adaptive batching and sampling
   - Priority-based event handling

6. **Media-specific Service Patterns**
   - Viewing session management
   - Playback state synchronization
   - Content availability verification

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified
- System gracefully degrades under extreme load while maintaining core streaming
- Metadata changes consistently propagate across all services
- Critical viewer journeys remain performant during resource contention
- Caches remain consistent after content or metadata updates
- Analytics data is complete despite batching and dual-path processing

### Critical User Scenarios
- Platform experiences viral traffic spike from popular content release
- Content metadata is updated and reflected across all user interfaces
- System prioritizes video playback during infrastructure partial failure
- Updated content is correctly reflected after caches are invalidated
- Complete viewer analytics are available despite heavy system load

### Performance Benchmarks
- System handles target concurrent viewer load with stable performance
- Metadata synchronization completes within specified timeframes
- Streaming quality metrics maintained during simulated peak events
- Cache performance meets targets while maintaining consistency
- Analytics processing handles event volume without impacting streaming

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extreme and unexpected traffic spikes
- Partial system failures during peak viewing times
- Network partitions between global regions
- Cache poisoning or inconsistency scenarios
- Analytics data loss or duplicate processing

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of load detection and degradation logic
- Complete testing of metadata synchronization mechanisms
- Full verification of service prioritization under various conditions
- Comprehensive testing of cache consistency and invalidation
- End-to-end validation of analytics processing paths

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Platform maintains streaming experience quality during 3x normal peak traffic
- Content metadata updates appear consistently across all services within target timeframe
- Critical user journeys maintain performance targets even during resource contention
- Caching reduces infrastructure costs by at least 40% while maintaining consistency
- Complete and accurate analytics available for both real-time and historical analysis
- System scales automatically with changing demand without manual intervention
- Global viewers experience consistent performance regardless of region
- Platform costs scale efficiently with viewer numbers and content catalog size

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment for this project:

1. Initialize the project using `uv`:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`

3. Run tests using `uv run pytest`

4. To execute specific Python scripts:
   ```
   uv run python your_script.py
   ```

5. For running linters and type checking:
   ```
