# Edge-Enabled Retail IoT Microservices Framework

## Overview
A lightweight, resource-efficient event-driven microservices framework designed for retail IoT environments, enabling seamless coordination between point-of-sale systems, inventory management, and customer analytics. The framework can operate on edge devices with limited computing resources while maintaining reliable synchronization with cloud services, even in environments with intermittent connectivity.

## Persona Description
Priya builds retail store systems connecting point-of-sale, inventory, and customer analytics using IoT devices. Her primary goal is to create a lightweight framework that can run on edge devices with limited resources while maintaining seamless coordination with cloud services.

## Key Requirements

1. **Edge-compatible Event Processing with Offline Operation Modes**
   - Lightweight event processing engine optimized for resource-constrained devices
   - Local event queue management for operation during network outages
   - Automatic synchronization when cloud connectivity is restored
   - Conflict resolution strategies for reconciling offline operations
   - This is critical for Priya as retail stores must continue functioning even during internet outages, ensuring uninterrupted customer service

2. **Bandwidth-efficient Event Batching and Compression**
   - Intelligent event batching based on priority and network conditions
   - Compression algorithms optimized for IoT event data
   - Delta-based updates to minimize data transfer
   - Configurable sending strategies based on network quality and cost
   - This enables Priya to minimize bandwidth usage in stores with limited connectivity while ensuring all critical data eventually reaches the cloud

3. **Device Capability Discovery with Dynamic Service Registration**
   - Automatic discovery of IoT devices and their capabilities
   - Dynamic registration of services provided by each device
   - Capability advertisement and negotiation between devices
   - Real-time service directory updates as devices join and leave
   - This allows Priya to create a plug-and-play environment where new devices automatically integrate into the store system

4. **Store-level Event Partitioning with Regional Aggregation**
   - Event partitioning by store location for data isolation
   - Local event processing for store-specific operations
   - Regional aggregation of events for multi-store analytics
   - Hierarchical event routing from store to regional to global levels
   - This ensures that each store operates independently while still contributing to the larger retail analytics system

5. **Power-aware Processing Prioritization for Battery-operated Devices**
   - Event processing strategies optimized for power efficiency
   - Adaptive duty cycling based on device battery levels
   - Priority-based event handling to conserve energy on critical devices
   - Power consumption monitoring and alerting
   - This helps Priya ensure that battery-powered devices (like handheld scanners) conserve energy while prioritizing critical retail operations
