# Multi-tenant SaaS Microservices Framework

## Overview
A multi-tenant event-driven microservices framework designed to serve thousands of business customers with varying usage patterns while maintaining tenant isolation and efficient resource utilization. The framework enables dynamic scaling of individual components based on tenant-specific demands and provides comprehensive tenant management capabilities including usage analytics and cost attribution.

## Persona Description
Jamal manages a multi-tenant SaaS application serving thousands of business customers with varying usage patterns. His primary goal is to implement a microservices architecture that enables tenant isolation while efficiently sharing infrastructure and scaling individual components based on tenant-specific demands.

## Key Requirements

1. **Tenant-aware Event Routing with Data Isolation Guarantees**
   - Event routing mechanism with tenant context propagation
   - Strict tenant data isolation at every service boundary
   - Tenant context validation for all cross-service communications
   - Comprehensive tenant data segmentation
   - This is critical for Jamal as it ensures that one tenant's data never leaks to another tenant, a fundamental requirement for multi-tenant SaaS applications

2. **Per-tenant Rate Limiting and Quota Enforcement**
   - Configurable rate limiting policies for different tenant tiers
   - Resource quota management based on tenant subscription levels
   - Graceful handling of quota exceedance scenarios
   - Real-time monitoring of tenant resource utilization
   - This enables Jamal to protect the system from resource monopolization by individual tenants and maintain fair service for all customers

3. **Tenant-specific Configuration with Dynamic Service Composition**
   - Configuration management system with tenant-specific settings
   - Dynamic service composition based on tenant requirements
   - Feature flagging system tied to tenant subscription levels
   - Hot reconfiguration without service restarts
   - This allows Jamal to customize the platform for different tenants while maintaining a single codebase

4. **Tenant Usage Analytics with Service-level Cost Attribution**
   - Detailed usage tracking for all tenant activities
   - Service-level resource consumption metrics
   - Cost attribution based on tenant resource utilization
   - Analytics dashboard data collection
   - This helps Jamal understand resource utilization patterns and optimize infrastructure costs based on actual tenant usage

5. **Multi-tenancy Patterns with Service Instance Pooling Strategies**
   - Implementation of various multi-tenancy patterns (shared, pool, dedicated)
   - Dynamic allocation of resources from shared service pools
   - Tenant isolation through virtual service boundaries
   - Elastic scaling based on tenant demand patterns
   - This provides Jamal with flexibility in how resources are allocated to tenants, optimizing for both cost and performance

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Comprehensive tests for tenant isolation mechanisms
- Ability to simulate multiple tenants with varying load patterns
- Tenant context propagation verification across all services
- Rate limiting and quota enforcement validation
- Performance testing under multi-tenant scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 10,000 active tenants
- Minimal overhead for tenant context propagation (< 5ms)
- Rate limiting decisions must be made within 10ms
- Dynamic configuration changes applied within 30 seconds
- Service instance allocation from pools within 5 seconds

### Integration Points
- Integration with identity and access management systems
- Billing system integration for usage-based charging
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Configuration management system
- Analytics data pipeline

### Key Constraints
- Strict tenant data isolation must be maintained at all times
- Resource efficiency through appropriate sharing of infrastructure
- Backward compatibility for tenant-specific configurations
- Linear cost scaling with tenant growth
- Support for geographic distribution of tenant data

## Core Functionality

The Multi-tenant SaaS Microservices Framework must provide:

1. **Tenant Context Management**
   - Tenant identification and authentication
   - Tenant context propagation across service boundaries
   - Tenant metadata management
   - Tenant lifecycle operations (onboarding, offboarding)

2. **Resource Control System**
   - Rate limiting implementation based on tenant tiers
   - Resource quota tracking and enforcement
   - Graceful degradation strategies for quota exceedance
   - Resource usage monitoring and alerting

3. **Tenant Configuration Management**
   - Hierarchical configuration system (platform, tenant, user)
   - Dynamic service composition based on tenant settings
   - Feature flag management tied to tenant subscriptions
   - Configuration change propagation

4. **Usage Analytics Engine**
   - Detailed event tracking for tenant activities
   - Resource utilization measurement
   - Cost attribution algorithms
   - Usage data aggregation and reporting

5. **Multi-tenancy Implementation**
   - Service instance pooling and allocation
   - Tenant-specific routing and load balancing
   - Elastic scaling based on tenant demand
   - Isolation enforcement mechanisms

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Tenant context propagation across all service boundaries
- Data isolation between tenants under various access patterns
- Rate limiting enforcement for different tenant tiers
- Dynamic configuration application for tenant-specific settings
- Resource scaling based on tenant demand

### Critical User Scenarios
- New tenant onboarding process
- Tenant activity during peak usage periods
- Multi-tenant concurrent access patterns
- Tenant configuration updates and feature enabling
- Tenant quota management during resource constraints

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must maintain performance with 10,000+ active tenants
- Tenant context propagation overhead less than 5ms per service hop
- Rate limiting decisions made within 10ms
- Configuration changes propagated within 30 seconds
- Resource allocation from pools within 5 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling tenants exceeding their resource quotas
- System behavior during partial service outages
- Data isolation during high concurrent multi-tenant activity
- Tenant migration between service pools
- Recovery from configuration corruption

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of tenant isolation mechanisms
- All tenant boundaries must have explicit isolation tests
- Performance tests must cover multi-tenant scenarios
- Security tests must verify tenant data isolation

## Success Criteria
- Framework successfully manages 10,000+ tenants with complete data isolation
- Infrastructure costs scale sub-linearly with tenant growth
- Tenant-specific configurations can be applied without service disruption
- Resource utilization is balanced across tenants according to their subscription tiers
- System performance remains consistent regardless of tenant count
- Usage analytics provide actionable insights for cost optimization
- Zero incidents of cross-tenant data exposure
