# Multi-tenant SaaS Microservices Framework

## Overview
A multi-tenant event-driven microservices framework designed for SaaS platforms serving thousands of business customers with varying usage patterns. This framework enables strong tenant isolation while efficiently sharing infrastructure and scaling individual components based on tenant-specific demands, with comprehensive tenant management, monitoring, and cost attribution capabilities.

## Persona Description
Jamal manages a multi-tenant SaaS application serving thousands of business customers with varying usage patterns. His primary goal is to implement a microservices architecture that enables tenant isolation while efficiently sharing infrastructure and scaling individual components based on tenant-specific demands.

## Key Requirements

1. **Tenant-aware Event Routing with Data Isolation Guarantees**
   - Implement tenant context propagation across service boundaries
   - Create event routing mechanisms that enforce strict tenant data isolation
   - This feature is critical for Jamal as it ensures that each customer's data remains strictly isolated, preventing cross-tenant data leakage while maintaining a shared infrastructure, essential for both security compliance and customer trust in a multi-tenant environment

2. **Per-tenant Rate Limiting and Quota Enforcement**
   - Develop configurable rate limiting at service and API levels based on tenant subscription tier
   - Create resource quota management with fair usage policies across tenants
   - This capability allows Jamal to protect the platform from excessive usage by individual tenants, ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing performance degradation for other customers while enabling various pricing tiers with different usage allowances

3. **Tenant-specific Configuration with Dynamic Service Composition**
   - Implement tenant configuration management with hierarchical override capabilities
   - Create dynamic service composition based on tenant feature entitlements
   - This feature enables Jamal to offer customized functionality to different customers while maintaining a single codebase, supporting various product editions and custom feature sets that align with different pricing and packaging options

4. **Tenant Usage Analytics with Service-level Cost Attribution**
   - Develop tenant-level usage tracking across all platform services
   - Create cost attribution models that map resource consumption to specific tenants
   - This capability provides Jamal with detailed insights into how different customers use the platform, enabling data-driven product decisions and accurate cost allocation, essential for understanding profitability by customer segment

5. **Multi-tenancy Patterns with Service Instance Pooling Strategies**
   - Implement resource pooling with tenant affinity options
   - Create intelligent instance allocation based on tenant usage patterns
   - This feature allows Jamal to optimize infrastructure costs through efficient resource sharing while providing options for dedicated resources when needed, balancing the economic benefits of multi-tenancy with the performance and isolation needs of different customers

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All multi-tenant mechanisms must be testable in isolation
- Tenant isolation must be verifiable through security testing
- Rate limiting must be testable with simulated load scenarios
- Configuration management must be testable with various tenant scenarios
- Usage tracking must produce verifiable audit trails for testing

### Performance Expectations
- Framework must support at least 10,000 active tenants on shared infrastructure
- Tenant context switching overhead must not exceed 5ms per service call
- Rate limiting decisions must be made within 10ms
- Configuration lookups must complete within 20ms including tenant-specific overrides
- Usage analytics must handle 10,000+ events per second with tenant attribution

### Integration Points
- Integration with identity and access management systems
- Hooks for billing and subscription management systems
- Interfaces for tenant provisioning and onboarding
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems
- Export capabilities for business intelligence tools

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain strict logical isolation between tenant data
- Should minimize per-tenant overhead to enable efficient scaling
- Must support seamless tenant onboarding and offboarding
- Should accommodate various tenant sizes from small to enterprise
- Must provide operational visibility at both individual tenant and platform levels

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Tenant Identity and Context Management**
   - Tenant identity verification and authentication
   - Tenant context propagation across service boundaries
   - Tenant context association with events and messages

2. **Multi-tenant Event Bus**
   - Tenant-aware event routing and filtering
   - Tenant isolation enforcement for event consumption
   - Cross-tenant event patterns for platform-wide operations

3. **Tenant Configuration System**
   - Hierarchical configuration with tenant-specific overrides
   - Feature flag management by tenant
   - Dynamic service composition based on tenant entitlements

4. **Resource Governance**
   - Tenant-aware rate limiting and throttling
   - Resource quota management by tenant tier
   - Fair usage enforcement across shared resources

5. **Tenant Usage Analytics**
   - Per-tenant metrics collection across services
   - Usage aggregation by tenant, feature, and time dimensions
   - Cost attribution modeling for tenant profitability analysis

6. **Tenant-aware Service Management**
   - Service instance pooling with tenant awareness
   - Tenant-specific scaling and resource allocation
   - Tenant lifecycle management (onboarding, offboarding, migration)

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified
- Complete tenant data isolation across all operations
- Correct application of rate limits based on tenant subscription
- Proper application of tenant-specific configurations and features
- Accurate tracking and attribution of resource usage by tenant
- Efficient resource sharing with appropriate isolation guarantees

### Critical User Scenarios
- New tenant onboarding with correct service provisioning
- Tenant exceeds rate limits and experiences appropriate throttling
- Tenant-specific feature enablement based on subscription tier
- Platform administrator reviews per-tenant usage and cost metrics
- System scales individual components based on tenant-specific load

### Performance Benchmarks
- System supports target number of concurrent active tenants
- Rate limiting decision time remains within specified threshold
- Configuration resolution performs within latency requirements
- Resource sharing mechanisms demonstrate efficiency gains
- Platform scales economically with increasing tenant count

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Tenant data isolation during partial system failures
- Handling of tenants with extremely high volume requirements
- Migration of tenants between service instances or tiers
- Graceful degradation during resource contention
- Tenant offboarding with complete data cleanup

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of tenant isolation mechanisms
- 100% coverage of rate limiting and quota enforcement logic
- Complete testing of configuration resolution including inheritance
- Full verification of usage tracking and attribution
- Comprehensive testing of tenant lifecycle operations

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Complete tenant data isolation verified through security testing
- Platform efficiently serves 10,000+ tenants on shared infrastructure
- Resource usage per tenant is accurately tracked and attributed
- System can scale individual components based on tenant-specific demand
- New tenant onboarding completes in less than 5 minutes
- Resource utilization improved by at least 40% compared to non-tenant-aware architecture
- No single tenant can degrade performance for others regardless of usage volume
- Profitability can be assessed at individual tenant level

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment for this project:

1. Initialize the project using `uv`:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`

3. Run tests using `uv run pytest`

4. To execute specific Python scripts:
   ```
   uv run python your_script.py
   ```

5. For running linters and type checking:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to design the framework as a library with well-documented APIs, not as an application with user interfaces. All functionality should be exposed through programmatic interfaces that can be easily tested and integrated into larger systems.
