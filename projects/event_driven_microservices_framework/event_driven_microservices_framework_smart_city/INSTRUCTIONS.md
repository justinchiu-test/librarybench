# Smart City Integration Microservices Framework

## Overview
A flexible, secure event-driven microservices framework designed to connect diverse municipal services across transportation, utilities, and public safety departments. The framework enables critical information sharing between city departments while maintaining independent operation, implements geospatial event routing, and provides robust privacy controls to protect citizen data.

## Persona Description
Raj develops systems connecting various municipal services for a smart city initiative spanning transportation, utilities, and public safety. His primary goal is to implement a microservices architecture that enables different city departments to share critical information while maintaining independent operation and specialized functionality.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geospatial Event Routing Based on City Zones and Jurisdictions**
   - Event routing based on geographic boundaries and jurisdictions
   - Spatial query capabilities for location-based event filtering
   - Dynamic zone definition and management for evolving city areas
   - Time-sensitive geofencing for temporary event boundaries
   - This is critical for Raj as it ensures events are processed by the appropriate department based on physical location and jurisdictional responsibility

2. **Cross-department Event Subscription with Authorization Policies**
   - Department-specific access control policies for event types
   - Role-based subscription management across city services
   - Departmental authorization framework with fine-grained permissions
   - Auditable subscription governance
   - This enables controlled sharing of information between departments (like traffic management and emergency services) while respecting organizational boundaries

3. **Emergency Broadcast Patterns with Priority Message Handling**
   - Priority-based message distribution for emergency situations
   - Interrupt capabilities for urgent public safety communications
   - Escalation pathways for critical city events
   - Guaranteed delivery mechanisms for emergency notifications
   - This allows Raj to ensure critical emergency information immediately reaches all relevant city systems and personnel regardless of normal operational patterns

4. **Long-term Data Archiving with Selective Event Persistence**
   - Policy-driven event persistence and archiving
   - Customizable retention periods for different event categories
   - Historical event access and analysis capabilities
   - Storage optimization for large-scale event histories
   - This supports both immediate operational needs and long-term data requirements for planning, analysis, and legal compliance

5. **Public/Private Information Barriers with Citizen Privacy Controls**
   - Strict separation of public and private citizen information
   - Configurable data anonymization for public-facing services
   - Consent management for citizen data usage
   - Privacy-preserving data aggregation techniques
   - This ensures that citizen privacy is protected while still enabling data-driven city services and transparent public information sharing

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Comprehensive testing framework for cross-department interactions
- Geospatial event routing verification tools
- Privacy control validation suite
- Emergency broadcast system testing without public impact
- Long-term data storage and retrieval verification

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 1 million city residents
- Geospatial routing decisions made within 50ms
- Emergency broadcast delivery to all systems within 5 seconds
- Ability to process at least 10,000 events per second during peak periods
- Historical data queries completed within 5 seconds for recent data, 30 seconds for archived data

### Integration Points
- City department information systems
- Geographic information systems (GIS)
- Public safety and emergency response systems
- Utility management systems
- Public-facing city information portals

### Key Constraints
- Must respect departmental authority and independence
- Strict compliance with data privacy regulations
- Support for legacy municipal systems
- Public transparency requirements for government operations
- Budget constraints of municipal funding

## Core Functionality

The Smart City Integration Microservices Framework must provide:

1. **Geospatial Event System**
   - Location-aware event distribution
   - Jurisdiction-based routing
   - Geographic boundary management
   - Spatial indexing and filtering

2. **Inter-department Authorization**
   - Access control policy management
   - Cross-department subscription system
   - Departmental permission enforcement
   - Subscription audit and governance

3. **Emergency Communication System**
   - Priority messaging infrastructure
   - Emergency broadcast mechanisms
   - Escalation pathway management
   - Critical event distribution

4. **Data Archiving Infrastructure**
   - Event persistence policy engine
   - Tiered storage management
   - Historical data access APIs
   - Retention compliance enforcement

5. **Privacy Protection Framework**
   - Public/private data separation
   - Anonymization and pseudonymization tools
   - Citizen consent management
   - Privacy-preserving analytics methods

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Geospatial event routing accuracy across city zones
- Proper enforcement of department access controls
- Emergency broadcast delivery within SLA targets
- Long-term data archiving and retrieval capabilities
- Effectiveness of privacy protection mechanisms

### Critical User Scenarios
- Traffic incident triggering coordinated response across departments
- Planned city event requiring temporary jurisdiction changes
- Emergency situation with escalating priority levels
- Historical analysis of multi-year urban infrastructure patterns
- Citizen data access with proper privacy controls

### Performance Benchmarks
- Geospatial routing decisions made within 50ms
- Support for 10,000+ events per second during peak periods
- Emergency broadcasts delivered within 5 seconds to all systems
- System scales to support 1 million+ city residents
- Historical queries complete within time SLAs based on data age

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of events that cross multiple jurisdictional boundaries
- System behavior during emergency situations with partial outages
- Resolution of conflicting department authority over incidents
- Recovery from data archiving failures
- Handling of invalid or malformed geospatial data

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of emergency broadcast paths
- All privacy protection mechanisms must have dedicated tests
- Comprehensive geospatial routing scenario tests
- Long-term archiving tests simulating multiple years of operation

## Success Criteria
- All city departments can seamlessly share information within authorized boundaries
- Emergency communications reach all relevant systems within seconds
- Citizen privacy is demonstrably protected in all operations
- Historical data is accessible for urban planning and analysis
- System handles the full scale of city operations with defined performance
- Municipal services can operate independently while accessing shared information
- Public transparency requirements are met while protecting sensitive data
- System adapts to changing city geography and departmental structures
