# High-scale Media Streaming Microservices Framework

## Overview
A high-performance event-driven microservices framework designed for video streaming platforms handling millions of concurrent viewers. The framework provides robust backpressure handling, content metadata synchronization, viewer experience prioritization, efficient caching strategies, and advanced analytics processing to ensure seamless viewing experiences even during massive usage spikes.

## Persona Description
Olivia designs backend systems for a video streaming service handling millions of concurrent viewers. Her primary goal is to create a microservices framework that efficiently manages content delivery, user preferences, and viewing statistics while maintaining a seamless viewing experience during usage spikes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Backpressure Handling with Graceful Degradation Patterns**
   - Intelligent load shedding mechanisms during traffic spikes
   - Priority-based request handling during system overload
   - Adaptive throughput control across service boundaries
   - Graceful feature degradation strategies preserving core functionality
   - This is critical for Olivia as streaming platforms experience massive traffic surges during popular content releases, and the system must remain operational even when overwhelmed

2. **Content Metadata Synchronization Across Service Boundaries**
   - Efficient content catalog synchronization between services
   - Real-time metadata propagation for content updates
   - Consistency management for distributed content information
   - Version control for metadata changes
   - This ensures that all services across the platform work with consistent content information, preventing issues like mismatched thumbnails, incorrect episode information, or outdated availability status

3. **Viewer Experience Prioritization with Tiered Service Levels**
   - Differentiated service quality tiers for different user segments
   - Experience-focused resource allocation during constraints
   - Quality of service guarantees for premium subscribers
   - Adaptive streaming optimizations based on user importance
   - This allows Olivia to protect the experience of high-value users during system stress while fairly managing resources across the user base

4. **Caching Strategies with Invalidation Event Propagation**
   - Multi-level content and metadata caching framework
   - Cache invalidation event distribution system
   - Cache warming strategies for anticipated popular content
   - Cache efficiency analytics and optimization
   - This maximizes system efficiency by reducing redundant processing and database load, while ensuring users always see the most current content

5. **Analytics Event Batching with Real-time and Historical Processing Paths**
   - Dual-path analytics processing for streaming events
   - Real-time viewer metrics for operational decisions
   - Batched historical analysis for business intelligence
   - Adaptive sampling during traffic spikes
   - This provides Olivia with both immediate operational insights and comprehensive long-term analytics without overwhelming the system during peak usage

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements

   - Cache efficiency analytics

5. **Analytics Processing Engine**
   - Dual-path event processing (real-time and batch)
   - Adaptive event sampling
   - Metrics aggregation and distribution
   - Analytics data repository management

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- System behavior under extreme load conditions
- Content metadata consistency across services
- Tiered service level enforcement during constraints
- Cache invalidation effectiveness and timing
- Analytics processing accuracy and timeliness

### Critical User Scenarios
- Popular content release with millions of simultaneous viewers

- Real-time analytics available within 30 seconds of events

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Flash crowd scenarios (sudden 10x traffic increase)
- Regional infrastructure failures
- Content metadata corruption or inconsistency
- Cache poisoning or invalidation storms
- Analytics processing pipeline backpressure

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- Load testing covering up to 200% of expected peak traffic
- All degradation paths must have explicit tests
- Cache behavior tested across all invalidation scenarios
- Analytics accuracy verified against known test patterns

## Success Criteria
