# Cross-Organizational Supply Chain Microservices Framework

## Overview
A secure inter-enterprise microservices framework designed for manufacturing supply chain integration, enabling standardized communication between organizations with different technology stacks. This framework focuses on maintaining data sovereignty, implementing cross-company authentication, ensuring contractual event delivery, providing selective visibility, and supporting legacy system integration.

## Persona Description
Leila designs integration solutions connecting multiple companies in a manufacturing supply chain. Her primary goal is to implement a microservices framework that enables secure, standardized communication between organizations with different technology stacks while maintaining each company's data sovereignty.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-organization Event Schema Standardization with Mapping**
   - Implement standardized supply chain event schemas with versioning support
   - Create transformation mechanisms for mapping between proprietary and standard formats
   - This feature is critical for Leila as it enables consistent communication between disparate systems across organizational boundaries, providing a common language for supply chain events while allowing each company to maintain their internal data models

2. **Cross-company Authentication with Limited Trust Boundaries**
   - Develop federated authentication that respects organizational boundaries
   - Create security domains with controlled cross-domain communication permissions
   - This capability ensures Leila's integration maintains separation between companies' systems while enabling secure, authorized communication, essential for protecting intellectual property and sensitive business information across the supply chain

3. **Contractual Event Delivery with Non-repudiation Guarantees**
   - Implement reliable event delivery with cryptographic proof of receipt
   - Create event transaction logs suitable for contractual verification
   - This feature provides Leila with auditable evidence of supply chain communications for dispute resolution, ensuring all organizations in the chain can verify that critical business events (orders, shipments, receipts) are properly delivered and acknowledged

4. **Supply Chain Visibility Controls with Selective Event Sharing**
   - Develop granular data sharing policies based on business relationships
   - Create multi-tiered visibility rules that reflect supply chain agreements
   - This capability allows Leila to implement appropriate transparency in the supply chain while respecting commercial confidentiality, giving partners the visibility they need for coordination without exposing sensitive business information

5. **Integration Adapter Patterns for Legacy System Compatibility**
   - Implement adapters for connecting legacy manufacturing and ERP systems
   - Create communication bridges between modern event-driven and traditional systems
   - This feature enables Leila to incorporate both older manufacturing systems and modern platforms into a unified supply chain network, maximizing existing technology investments while providing a path to modernization

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All integration patterns must be testable using virtual partner simulation
- Schema transformation must be verifiable for accuracy and data integrity
- Authentication and security boundaries must be tested for proper isolation
- Event delivery guarantees must be verifiable through controlled fault injection
- Visibility controls must be testable for proper information filtering

### Performance Expectations
- Schema transformation must complete within 100ms per message
- Cross-company authentication must resolve within 200ms
- Event delivery with non-repudiation must process within 500ms end-to-end
- Visibility controls must apply within 50ms per request
- Legacy system adapters must not introduce more than 200ms of additional latency

### Integration Points
- Integration with industry standard supply chain protocols (EDI, GS1, etc.)
- Connections to enterprise ERP and MES systems
- Interfaces with logistics and transportation management systems
- Integration with supplier and customer portals
- Connectivity with blockchain or distributed ledger solutions

### Key Constraints
- Must respect legal and regulatory boundaries between organizations
- Should operate across varied network environments including restricted corporate networks
- Must accommodate different security policies across participating organizations
- Should support gradual adoption without requiring full-stack replacement
- Must operate with both real-time and batch processing systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Inter-organizational Event Exchange**
   - Standardized event formats with transformation capabilities
   - Cross-company routing and delivery guarantees
   - Supply chain event processing patterns

2. **Multi-enterprise Security Framework**
   - Federated identity across organizational boundaries
   - Cross-domain access control and authorization
   - Security boundary enforcement

3. **Business Transaction Management**
   - Non-repudiation evidence collection
   - Transaction logging with cryptographic verification
   - Audit trail generation for business events

4. **Visibility and Information Control**
   - Multi-tiered data sharing rules engine
   - Selective event publishing based on business relationships
   - Data redaction and sanitization for controlled transparency

5. **Legacy System Integration**
   - Protocol adapters for traditional enterprise systems
   - Batch-to-event translation mechanisms
   - Transaction mapping across system boundaries

6. **Supply Chain Coordination**
   - Order-to-fulfillment tracking across organizations
   - Exception management and notification
   - Distributed inventory visibility

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified
- Event schemas correctly transform between proprietary and standard formats
- Cross-company authentication maintains proper security boundaries
- Contractual event delivery provides verifiable proof of receipt
- Visibility controls correctly limit information based on business relationships
- Legacy system adapters accurately bridge between different communication patterns

### Critical User Scenarios
- Manufacturer places order with supplier through the framework
- Quality issue alert propagates across relevant supply chain partners
- Logistics provider updates shipment status visible to appropriate parties
- Legacy ERP system integrates with modern microservices
- Supply chain participants verify contractual fulfillment during dispute

### Performance Benchmarks
- System handles typical manufacturing supply chain volumes
- Response times meet requirements across typical manufacturing networks
- Authentication and security overhead remains within acceptable limits
- System scales to accommodate full multi-tier supply chain
- Legacy integration performs within required latency thresholds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network disruptions between organizations
- Schema version mismatches across partners
- Authentication system outages
- Disputed transactions requiring non-repudiation evidence
- Partial adoption scenarios with mixed integration approaches

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of schema transformation logic
- 100% coverage of cross-company authentication mechanisms
- Complete testing of non-repudiation functionality
- Full verification of visibility control rules
- Comprehensive testing of legacy adapters with various protocols

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment for this project:

1. Initialize the project using `uv`:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`

3. Run tests using `uv run pytest`

4. To execute specific Python scripts:
   ```
   uv run python your_script.py
   ```

5. For running linters and type checking:
   ```
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run pyright
   ```

Remember to design the framework as a library with well-documented APIs, not as an application with user interfaces. All functionality should be exposed through programmatic interfaces that can be easily tested and integrated into larger systems.
