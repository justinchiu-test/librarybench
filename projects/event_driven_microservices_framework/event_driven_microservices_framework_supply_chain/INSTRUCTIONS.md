# Cross-Organization Supply Chain Microservices Framework

## Overview
This project is a specialized event-driven microservices framework designed for supply chain integration across multiple organizations. It focuses on secure cross-company communication, standardized data exchange, contractual event delivery, selective visibility controls, and legacy system integration to create a robust platform for coordinating complex manufacturing and logistics workflows while respecting each participant's data sovereignty.

## Persona Description
Leila designs integration solutions connecting multiple companies in a manufacturing supply chain. Her primary goal is to implement a microservices framework that enables secure, standardized communication between organizations with different technology stacks while maintaining each company's data sovereignty.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-organization Event Schema Standardization with Mapping**
   - Implement standardized event schemas for cross-organization communication
   - Create schema mapping for translating between company-specific data models
   - Support for schema evolution with backward compatibility
   - Include validation for adherence to agreed-upon standards
   - This feature is critical for ensuring consistent communication between diverse organizations despite their different internal data representations

2. **Cross-company Authentication with Limited Trust Boundaries**
   - Develop secure authentication between organizations without requiring full trust
   - Create fine-grained authorization for specific event types and operations
   - Support for revocable access tokens with limited scope
   - Include audit logging of all cross-organization access
   - This feature enables secure collaboration while protecting sensitive company information by enforcing clear trust boundaries

3. **Contractual Event Delivery with Non-repudiation Guarantees**
   - Implement guaranteed delivery with acknowledgment and receipts
   - Create cryptographic non-repudiation for critical supply chain events
   - Support for delivery SLAs with compliance monitoring
   - Include dispute resolution evidence gathering
   - This feature ensures that critical supply chain events (orders, shipments, etc.) cannot be denied by either party, establishing a trustworthy foundation for business operations

4. **Supply Chain Visibility Controls with Selective Event Sharing**
   - Develop configurable visibility rules for upstream and downstream partners
   - Create selective event sharing based on need-to-know principles
   - Support for time-bound and context-sensitive visibility
   - Include aggregated insights without exposing raw data
   - This feature allows companies to share necessary information without exposing proprietary details about their internal operations

5. **Integration Adapter Patterns for Legacy System Compatibility**
   - Implement adapter patterns for various legacy system types
   - Create protocol translation for different communication methods
   - Support for batch/real-time conversion where required
   - Include graceful degradation when legacy systems are unavailable
   - This feature enables integration with existing enterprise systems regardless of their age or technology, avoiding costly replacements

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Support for simulating multi-organization communication
- Ability to test contract compliance and non-repudiation
- Testing of schema validation and translation
- Verification of security boundaries and access controls

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 50 connected organizations in a supply chain
- Maximum event delivery latency of 1 second for standard operations
- Ability to process 10,000+ supply chain events per hour
- Support for legacy system integration with up to 1-minute polling intervals

### Integration Points
- Support for common enterprise integration protocols (SFTP, AS2, API)
- Compatibility with EDI, XML, JSON, and other data formats
- Integration with identity and access management systems
- Support for existing ERP and supply chain management systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate across organizational boundaries with limited trust
- Must respect data sovereignty and privacy requirements
- Must provide legally binding event delivery guarantees
- Must work with heterogeneous technology environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Inter-organization Communication**
   - Standardized event schemas
   - Schema mapping and translation
   - Validation and compliance checking
   - Schema versioning and evolution

2. **Security and Trust Infrastructure**
   - Cross-company authentication
   - Limited trust authorization
   - Secure token management
   - Audit logging and monitoring

3. **Contractual Event Management**
   - Guaranteed delivery with acknowledgment
   - Non-repudiation mechanisms
   - SLA monitoring and enforcement
   - Dispute resolution support

4. **Visibility and Data Sharing**
   - Configurable visibility rules
   - Selective event sharing
   - Aggregation and anonymization
   - Time and context-bound access

5. **Legacy System Integration**
   - Adapter implementation
   - Protocol translation
   - Batch/real-time conversion
   - Resilient integration patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities that Must be Verified
- Schema standardization and mapping between organizations
- Secure cross-company authentication and authorization
- Contractual delivery with non-repudiation
- Selective visibility based on configurable rules
- Legacy system integration through adapters

### Critical User Scenarios
- End-to-end order-to-delivery process across multiple organizations
- Handling of exceptions in the supply chain (delays, shortages)
- Secure sharing of forecasts with limited visibility
- Integration with legacy ERP systems
- Dispute resolution with cryptographic evidence

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process 10,000+ cross-organizational events per hour
- Maintain event delivery latency under 1 second for standard events
- Support minimum 50 connected organizations
- Handle 1,000 concurrent cross-company users

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network issues between organizations
- Schema incompatibilities during evolution
- Repudiation attempts for delivered events
- Legacy system unavailability
- Security token revocation scenarios

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all code
- 100% coverage of schema validation and mapping
- 100% coverage of security and authentication mechanisms
- 100% coverage of contractual delivery functionality
- 100% coverage of legacy adapter patterns

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Organizations can exchange standardized events with proper schema translation
2. Cross-company authentication maintains appropriate trust boundaries
3. Events are delivered with contractual guarantees and non-repudiation
4. Supply chain visibility is properly controlled according to configured rules
5. Legacy systems are successfully integrated through appropriate adapters
6. Performance meets the specified benchmarks
7. All test cases pass with the required coverage

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

### Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the project in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Install test dependencies
uv pip install pytest pytest-json-report

# Run tests and generate the required JSON report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

CRITICAL: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a mandatory requirement for project completion. This file serves as evidence that all functionality has been implemented correctly and passes all tests.
