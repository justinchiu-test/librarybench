# Cross-organizational Supply Chain Microservices Framework

## Overview
A secure, standardized event-driven microservices framework designed for supply chain integration across multiple organizations with different technology stacks. The framework enables secure communication between companies while respecting data sovereignty, provides standardized event schemas with mapping capabilities, and implements contractual event delivery with non-repudiation guarantees.

## Persona Description
Leila designs integration solutions connecting multiple companies in a manufacturing supply chain. Her primary goal is to implement a microservices framework that enables secure, standardized communication between organizations with different technology stacks while maintaining each company's data sovereignty.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-organization Event Schema Standardization with Mapping**
   - Standardized event schema registry for supply chain events
   - Schema mapping capabilities for different organizations' data formats
   - Schema versioning and compatibility management
   - Validation mechanisms for schema compliance
   - This is critical for Leila as it allows different companies with varied systems to communicate using a common language while preserving their internal data structures

2. **Cross-company Authentication with Limited Trust Boundaries**
   - Cross-organizational identity and access management
   - Federated authentication with limited scope
   - Cryptographic verification of message origins
   - Trust boundary enforcement between organizations
   - This enables secure communication between companies in the supply chain without requiring full mutual trust, protecting each organization's systems

3. **Contractual Event Delivery with Non-repudiation Guarantees**
   - Guaranteed event delivery with acknowledgment mechanisms
   - Cryptographic proof of message receipt and processing
   - Digital signatures for event authenticity verification
   - Contractual SLA enforcement and monitoring
   - This provides Leila with auditable proof that critical supply chain communications have been delivered and processed, which is essential for contractual obligations

4. **Supply Chain Visibility Controls with Selective Event Sharing**
   - Configurable event visibility policies between organizations
   - Granular control over shared supply chain data
   - Multi-level access permissions for different partner types
   - Transparency level management based on partnership agreements
   - This allows companies to share the necessary supply chain information without exposing sensitive internal data or competitive information

5. **Integration Adapter Patterns for Legacy System Compatibility**
   - Flexible adapter architecture for diverse technology integration
   - Protocol translation for legacy supply chain systems
   - Batch-to-event transformation for traditional EDI systems
   - Minimal-impact integration strategies for existing systems
   - This helps Leila connect newer event-driven architectures with older supply chain systems that many manufacturing companies still rely on

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Comprehensive testing framework for cross-organization interactions
- Mock implementations for partner systems
- Validation tools for schema compliance
- Security testing for cross-company authentication
- Contract verification test suites

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 100 participating organizations
- Event processing throughput of at least 1000 supply chain events per minute
- Schema validation and transformation overhead under 50ms
- Authentication and authorization decisions within 100ms
- End-to-end delivery guarantee with maximum 15-minute SLA

### Integration Points
- ERP and supply chain management systems
- EDI and traditional B2B integration platforms
- Identity and access management systems
- Logistics tracking systems
- Manufacturing execution systems

### Key Constraints
- Must respect each organization's data sovereignty
- Minimal deployment footprint within each organization
- Support for diverse technology stacks and maturity levels
- Compliance with international trade and data regulations
- Offline operation capabilities for disconnected manufacturing environments

## Core Functionality

The Cross-organizational Supply Chain Microservices Framework must provide:

1. **Schema Management System**
   - Supply chain event schema registry
   - Schema mapping and transformation engine
   - Version compatibility management
   - Validation and compliance verification

2. **Cross-organizational Security**
   - Federated identity management
   - Cross-company authentication mechanisms
   - Cryptographic message verification
   - Trust boundary enforcement

3. **Contractual Messaging System**
   - Guaranteed delivery implementation
   - Non-repudiation through cryptographic receipts
   - SLA monitoring and enforcement
   - Dispute resolution evidence collection

4. **Visibility Control Framework**
   - Data sharing policy management
   - Selective event publication
   - Partner-specific data filtering
   - Transparency level configuration

5. **Legacy System Integration**
   - Adapter architecture for diverse systems
   - Protocol translation capabilities
   - Batch-to-event processing
   - Legacy system connection management

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Schema standardization and mapping between different formats
- Cross-company authentication and authorization
- Contractual delivery guarantees and non-repudiation
- Selective data sharing based on partnership level
- Legacy system integration through adapters

### Critical User Scenarios
- End-to-end order processing across multiple supply chain partners
- Manufacturing schedule adjustments propagated to suppliers
- Shipping status updates shared with relevant partners only
- Legacy EDI system integration with modern event-driven systems
- Supply chain disruption handling across organizational boundaries

### Performance Benchmarks
- Support for 100+ connected organizations
- Processing of 1000+ supply chain events per minute
- Schema validation and transformation in under 50ms
- Authentication decisions made within 100ms
- Maximum 15-minute delivery guarantee for critical events

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network disconnections between organizations
- Schema version conflicts between partners
- Authentication system outages
- Contractual delivery failures
- Legacy system format inconsistencies

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of security-related code paths
- All schema mapping scenarios must have specific tests
- Comprehensive contract verification test suite
- Connection resilience testing for all adapter types

## Success Criteria
- Seamless integration of 10+ organizations with different technology stacks
- End-to-end supply chain visibility agreed by all partners
- Verifiable delivery and processing of all contractual communications
- Successful integration with at least 5 different legacy system types
- Zero unauthorized data access between organizations
- Complete audit trail of all cross-organizational communications
- 99.9% successful event delivery within contractual SLAs
- Reduced integration time for new supply chain partners by 75%
