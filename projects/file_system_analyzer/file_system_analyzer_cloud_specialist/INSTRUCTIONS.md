# Cloud Migration Storage Analyzer

A specialized file system analysis library for cloud migration specialists to plan and optimize on-premises to cloud storage transitions

## Overview

The Cloud Migration Storage Analyzer is a specialized file system analysis library designed for professionals who help organizations migrate from on-premises infrastructure to cloud platforms. It provides cloud cost projection, migration complexity assessment, hybrid environment analysis, application-specific storage pattern detection, and data gravity analysis to plan efficient and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## Persona Description

Aisha helps organizations migrate on-premises infrastructure to cloud platforms. She needs to analyze existing storage usage to plan efficient and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Cost Projection Tools**
   - Implement analytics to compare on-premises storage costs with equivalent cloud storage tiers
   - Create detailed TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) models for various migration scenarios
   - This feature is critical for Aisha because accurate cost projections are essential for migration planning and budgeting, helping clients understand the financial implications of different cloud storage options compared to their current infrastructure

2. **Migration Complexity Scoring**
   - Develop analysis algorithms to identify data that may be challenging to transfer due to size, structure, or access patterns
   - Create a complexity assessment framework for prioritizing migration efforts
   - This capability is essential because not all data migrates equally well to cloud environments, and identifying potentially problematic datasets early allows for appropriate planning and mitigation strategies

3. **Hybrid Environment Analysis**
   - Implement tools for analyzing phased migrations with data dependencies between cloud and on-premises systems
   - Create visualization of cross-environment dependencies and access patterns
   - This feature is vital for Aisha because most large organizations require phased migrations where systems operate in hybrid mode, and understanding data dependencies between environments is crucial for maintaining operational continuity

4. **Application-Specific Storage Pattern Detection**
   - Design analysis capabilities to match appropriate cloud storage services (block, object, file) to application needs
   - Create recommendations for optimal cloud storage configurations
   - This functionality is critical because different applications have unique storage requirements, and mapping these to the appropriate cloud storage services ensures optimal performance and cost efficiency after migration

5. **Data Gravity Analysis**
   - Implement analytics to identify which datasets attract the most access and processing requirements
   - Create migration sequence recommendations based on data gravity
   - This feature is crucial for Aisha because datasets with high "gravity" (frequently accessed by multiple systems) significantly impact migration planning, affecting what should be migrated first, last, or potentially remain on-premises

## Technical Requirements
