# Cloud Migration Storage Assessment System

## Overview
A specialized file system analysis library for cloud migration planning that analyzes on-premises storage usage to plan efficient and cost-effective cloud deployments. This solution provides cloud cost projections, migration complexity analysis, and storage service matching.

## Persona Description
Aisha helps organizations migrate on-premises infrastructure to cloud platforms. She needs to analyze existing storage usage to plan efficient and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## Key Requirements
1. **Cloud cost projection tools**
   - Develop detailed analytics comparing on-premises storage with equivalent cloud storage tiers
   - Create accurate cost models for various cloud providers and storage options
   - Account for ingress/egress costs, operational overhead, and performance requirements
   - Generate multi-year cost projections with different growth scenarios

2. **Migration complexity scoring system**
   - Implement algorithms to identify data that may be challenging to transfer due to size or structure
   - Create complexity metrics based on dependencies, access patterns, and compliance requirements
   - Develop phased migration planning based on complexity scores
   - Generate risk assessments and mitigation strategies for migration challenges

3. **Hybrid environment analysis framework**
   - Design analytics for phased migrations with data dependencies between cloud and on-premises
   - Track cross-environment dependencies and access patterns
   - Identify potential performance or consistency issues in hybrid scenarios
   - Create optimization recommendations for hybrid storage configurations

4. **Application-specific storage pattern detection**
   - Develop detection algorithms for application-specific storage patterns
   - Match appropriate cloud storage services (block, object, file) based on access patterns
   - Identify optimization opportunities during migration
   - Generate application-specific migration recommendations

5. **Data gravity analysis engine**
   - Implement analytics to identify which datasets attract the most access and processing requirements
   - Track interdependencies between data sets and computing resources
   - Create optimization strategies for data placement across cloud regions and services
   - Generate recommendations for minimizing latency and transfer costs

## Technical Requirements
- **Accuracy**: Cost projections must be accurate within 10% of actual cloud provider pricing
- **Comprehensiveness**: Must support major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and their storage offerings
- **Adaptability**: Must accommodate various migration strategies (lift-and-shift, re-platforming, refactoring)
- **Risk Management**: Must identify and quantify migration risks with appropriate mitigation strategies
- **Performance**: Analysis operations must efficiently handle enterprise-scale storage environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.
