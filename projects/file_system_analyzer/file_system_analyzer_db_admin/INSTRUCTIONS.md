# Database Storage Optimization Analyzer

A file system analyzer specialized for database storage management and optimization.

## Overview

The Database Storage Optimization Analyzer is a Python library designed to help database administrators analyze and optimize how storage is used by database files, logs, and backups. It provides specialized tools for recognizing database file patterns, analyzing transaction logs, evaluating index efficiency, visualizing tablespace fragmentation, and measuring backup compression effectiveness.

## Persona Description

Elena manages large database deployments and needs to analyze how storage is used by database files, logs, and backups. Her goal is to optimize performance and minimize storage costs while ensuring data integrity.

## Key Requirements

1. **Database-Specific File Pattern Recognition**:
   Automatic detection and categorization of files associated with major database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.). This is critical for Elena because it provides immediate insight into how different database components consume storage, allowing her to separate data files from logs, configuration, and temporary files. The system must recognize patterns specific to each database engine.

2. **Transaction Log Analysis**:
   Correlation of log growth patterns with database operations and transactions. This feature is essential because transaction logs can consume significant storage and impact performance. Elena needs to understand how specific database workloads affect log growth to optimize retention policies and storage allocation for logs without compromising recoverability.

3. **Index Efficiency Metrics**:
   Analysis of storage overhead versus query performance benefits for database indexes. This capability is crucial since indexes improve query performance but consume additional storage. Elena needs data-driven insights to make informed decisions about which indexes provide sufficient performance benefits to justify their storage costs.

4. **Tablespace Fragmentation Visualization**:
   Detection and visualization of tablespace fragmentation with actionable optimization recommendations. This is vital for maintaining database performance as fragmented tablespaces lead to inefficient storage usage and degraded query performance. Elena needs to proactively identify and address fragmentation before it impacts users.

5. **Backup Compression Efficiency Reporting**:
   Comparison of various backup compression algorithms and strategies to identify optimal approaches. This feature is essential for minimizing the storage footprint of database backups while ensuring adequate recovery capabilities. Elena needs to balance storage efficiency with recovery time objectives across different database systems.

## Technical Requirements
