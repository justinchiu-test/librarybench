# CI/CD Storage Efficiency Analyzer

A specialized file system analyzer for optimizing CI/CD pipelines and build environments.

## Overview

The CI/CD Storage Efficiency Analyzer is a Python library that helps DevOps engineers understand and optimize how source code organization and build artifacts impact storage requirements and performance in continuous integration and delivery environments. It provides deep integration with code repositories, build artifact analysis, container optimization, cache effectiveness metrics, and pipeline-specific visualizations.

## Persona Description

Marcus is a DevOps engineer responsible for optimizing CI/CD pipelines and build environments. He needs to understand how source code organization and build artifacts impact storage requirements and performance.

## Key Requirements

1. **Repository Integration**:
   Tools that integrate with code repositories to correlate storage patterns with specific commits and branches. This is critical for Marcus because it allows him to understand how code changes impact storage over time and attribute storage usage to specific development activities. The system must identify patterns in how different types of changes affect storage requirements.

2. **Build Artifact Analysis**:
   Functionality to identify redundant or unnecessarily large compilation outputs. This feature is essential because build artifacts often consume significant storage in CI/CD environments. Marcus needs to pinpoint inefficient build processes that generate redundant intermediate files or fail to clean up temporary artifacts, leading to storage waste.

3. **Container Image Optimization**:
   Tools for analyzing Docker and container image layers to identify inefficient storage usage. This capability is crucial in modern CI/CD environments where container-based deployment is common. Marcus needs detailed insights into layer composition, duplication, and size to implement more storage-efficient containerization strategies.

4. **Cache Effectiveness Metrics**:
   Analytics showing hit/miss ratios and storage impact of various caching strategies. This is vital because caching is a key performance optimization in CI/CD pipelines, but it can also consume significant storage. Marcus needs to balance cache size with effectiveness to optimize both performance and storage usage.

5. **Pipeline Visualization**:
   Detailed visualizations showing storage impact of each stage in the CI/CD workflow. This feature is essential for identifying storage bottlenecks in complex pipelines. Marcus needs to understand which pipeline stages generate the most storage load to focus optimization efforts where they will have the greatest impact.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have clear interfaces that can be tested independently
- Repository scanning must support mock repositories for testing
- Build artifact analysis should work with predefined test datasets
- Container image analysis must support standard OCI format images
- Test coverage must exceed 90% for all core functionality

### Performance Expectations
- Repository analysis must process at least 10,000 commits per minute
- Build artifact scanning should handle 1GB of artifacts per minute
- Container image analysis should process at least 5 large images per minute
- Memory usage should not exceed 500MB during standard operations
- Analysis results should be cached with efficient incremental updates

### Integration Points
- Git, Mercurial, and SVN repository APIs
- Docker/OCI container image format support
- CI/CD system plugins (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Artifact repository integration (Artifactory, Nexus, etc.)
- Export formats for analysis results (JSON, CSV, HTML reports)

### Key Constraints
- Analysis must be non-destructive (read-only)
- Operations should be designed to minimize impact on running CI/CD systems
- Implementation must work across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
- Sensitive information like credentials must never be logged or exposed
- Analysis should scale from single developer setups to enterprise CI/CD farms

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The CI/CD Storage Efficiency Analyzer must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Repository Storage Analysis**:
   - Commit and branch size impact analysis
   - Historical storage growth tracking by component
   - File type and language statistics
   - Identification of large binary files in repositories
   - Detection of common repository anti-patterns

2. **Build Artifact Management**:
   - Artifact size and type classification
   - Temporal analysis of artifact creation and retention
   - Duplicate and redundant artifact detection
   - Artifact dependency mapping
   - Cleanup opportunity identification

3. **Container Optimization Engine**:
   - Layer-by-layer image analysis
   - Duplicate content detection across layers
   - Base image comparison and recommendations
   - Inefficient Dockerfile pattern detection
   - Multi-stage build optimization suggestions

4. **Cache Analysis Framework**:
   - Cache hit/miss ratio tracking over time
   - Storage consumption versus time saved metrics
   - Lifecycle management of cached objects
   - Optimal cache size recommendations
   - Cross-pipeline cache sharing opportunities

5. **Pipeline Storage Profiling**:
   - Stage-by-stage storage impact analysis
   - Identification of storage-intensive operations
   - Resource usage correlation with pipeline steps
   - Pipeline comparison across branches and projects
   - Trend analysis for pipeline storage efficiency

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of repository storage mapping to commits and branches
- Precision of build artifact redundancy detection
- Effectiveness of container image optimization recommendations
- Reliability of cache effectiveness metrics
- Correctness of pipeline stage storage attribution

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analysis of a large monorepo with diverse file types and languages
- Optimization of build processes generating numerous artifacts
- Container image analysis for applications with multiple dependency layers
- Cache optimization for matrix build scenarios
- Pipeline profiling for complex multi-stage deployment workflows

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete analysis of a repository with 10,000 commits in under 10 minutes
- Processing of 5GB of build artifacts in under 15 minutes
- Analysis of container images up to 5GB in size in under 5 minutes
- Memory usage below 500MB during all operations
- Response time under 200ms for cached analysis results

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling corrupted or incomplete repository data
- Graceful operation with restricted permissions
- Proper analysis of extremely large individual files (>2GB)
- Recovery from interrupted operations
- Appropriate handling of network failures during repository access

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of core analysis algorithms
- All public APIs must have integration tests
- Performance tests for resource-intensive operations
- Test cases for all supported repository and container formats

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

NOTE: To set up your development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`.

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY for project completion. Use the following commands:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
