# Academic Storage Resource Optimizer

A specialized file system analysis library for educational institutions to efficiently allocate and manage storage resources

## Overview

The Academic Storage Resource Optimizer is a specialized file system analysis library designed for educational IT coordinators managing storage resources across academic departments. It provides user quota analysis, educational content identification, semester-based usage pattern visualization, shared resource optimization, and administrative reporting to efficiently allocate limited storage resources across faculty, research, and student needs.

## Persona Description

Miguel manages IT resources for a university department with limited budget but diverse computing needs. He needs to efficiently allocate storage resources across faculty, research, and student needs.

## Key Requirements

1. **User Quota Analysis and Recommendation Engine**
   - Implement analytics to evaluate historical storage usage patterns by user type
   - Create a recommendation system for optimal quota allocations
   - This feature is critical for Miguel because educational environments have limited storage budgets, and data-driven quota allocation ensures resources are distributed fairly based on demonstrated need rather than arbitrary assignments

2. **Educational Content Identification**
   - Develop classification algorithms to distinguish course materials from personal files
   - Create organization recommendations for educational content
   - This capability is essential because academic storage often contains a mix of personal and educational files, and identifying course materials helps implement appropriate retention policies and ensure educational resources remain accessible

3. **Semester-Based Usage Pattern Visualization**
   - Implement analytics to visualize storage demand fluctuations throughout the academic year
   - Create predictive models for peak usage periods
   - This feature is vital for Miguel because academic storage usage follows patterns tied to the academic calendar, and understanding these cyclical demands helps with capacity planning and resource allocation

4. **Shared Resource Optimization**
   - Design analysis tools to identify opportunities for consolidated storage services
   - Create recommendations for optimizing shared resources
   - This functionality is critical because academic departments often have multiple overlapping storage systems, and identifying consolidation opportunities reduces costs and administrative overhead while improving service quality

5. **Administrative Reporting for Non-Technical Stakeholders**
   - Develop simple graphical reports designed for presentation to department administrators
   - Create non-technical summaries of storage utilization and recommendations
   - This feature is crucial for Miguel because securing budget and support for storage initiatives requires effectively communicating technical needs to non-technical department administrators who control funding

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock data representing typical academic storage patterns
- Test fixtures with synthetic semester cycles
- Verification of quota recommendation algorithms
- Parameterized tests for different department types
- Validation of content classification accuracy
- Integration testing with educational content samples

### Performance Expectations
- Support for departmental storage environments up to 100TB
- Analysis completion in under 4 hours for standard departments
- Efficient processing of user directories with high file counts
- Support for heterogeneous storage environments common in academia
- Low resource requirements to run on existing administrative systems
- Batch processing capabilities for overnight analysis jobs

### Integration Points
- Student information systems for enrollment data
- Course management systems (Moodle, Canvas, etc.)
- Directory services for user information
- Department budget tracking systems
- Resource allocation approval workflows
- Existing storage management tools

### Key Constraints
- Must operate within tight budget constraints
- Support for heterogeneous and aging storage infrastructure
- Privacy requirements for educational records (FERPA compliance)
- Accommodation of diverse departmental needs within a single institution
- Support for both centralized and decentralized IT governance models
- Minimal disruption to academic activities during implementation

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Academic Storage Resource Optimizer includes:

1. A user quota analysis system that evaluates historical usage patterns
2. A recommendation engine for optimal quota allocation by user type
3. A content classification system specialized for educational materials
4. A semester pattern detection system for academic usage cycles
5. A shared resource analyzer that identifies consolidation opportunities
6. A non-technical reporting system for administrative stakeholders
7. A visualization engine for academic storage patterns
8. A predictive modeling system for storage demand forecasting
9. A policy enforcement component for implementing storage guidelines
10. An API for integration with academic information systems

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of user quota recommendations
- Correctness of educational content classification
- Precision of semester pattern detection
- Validity of shared resource optimization recommendations
- Clarity and accuracy of administrative reports
- Performance with diverse academic storage environments
- Accuracy of predictive models for academic cycles

### Critical User Scenarios
- Allocating storage quotas across faculty, staff, and student users
- Identifying and organizing course-related materials
- Predicting storage needs for upcoming academic periods
- Finding opportunities to consolidate duplicate storage services
- Communicating storage utilization to department administrators
- Implementing storage policies aligned with academic needs
- Managing transitions between academic terms

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete analysis of 50TB departmental storage in under 4 hours
- User quota analysis for 5,000+ accounts in under 30 minutes
- Content classification at a rate of at least 10GB per minute
- Semester pattern detection across 5+ years of historical data
- Shared resource analysis completion in under 2 hours
- Report generation in under 5 minutes for standard departments

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling departments with unusual academic calendars
- Managing analysis during academic term transitions
- Processing storage with inconsistent naming conventions
- Dealing with legacy storage systems and formats
- Handling departments with specialized technical requirements
- Managing privacy requirements for sensitive academic data
- Processing storage with highly variable usage patterns

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >90% coverage of quota recommendation algorithms
- 100% coverage of educational content classification
- Thorough testing of semester pattern detection
- Comprehensive coverage of shared resource analysis
- Complete verification of administrative reporting
- Validation against multiple academic department profiles
- Full testing of policy enforcement mechanisms

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when it:

1. Provides quota recommendations that reduce both overallocation and storage shortages by at least 30%
2. Accurately identifies educational content with at least 90% precision
3. Correctly identifies semester-based usage patterns that correlate with academic calendars
4. Identifies viable shared resource consolidation opportunities that reduce overall storage costs
5. Generates clear, persuasive reports that non-technical administrators can understand
6. Accommodates the diverse needs of different academic users (faculty, researchers, students)
7. Integrates with existing academic information systems
8. Operates within constrained IT budgets typical of educational environments
9. Reduces storage management overhead for IT staff by at least 25%
10. Demonstrates measurable improvements in storage resource utilization
