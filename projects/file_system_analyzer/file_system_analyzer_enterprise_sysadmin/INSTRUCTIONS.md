# Enterprise Storage Analytics System

## Overview
A comprehensive file system analysis library specifically designed for enterprise environments with hundreds of servers. This solution enables proactive storage management by tracking usage patterns, predicting capacity issues, and integrating with enterprise monitoring platforms.

## Persona Description
Alex is a senior systems administrator managing storage infrastructure for a multinational corporation with hundreds of servers. His primary goal is to proactively identify storage trends and prevent capacity-related outages before they impact business operations.

## Key Requirements
1. **Automated scheduled scanning with configurable retention policies**
   - Enable configurable, automated scans across multiple server file systems on customizable schedules
   - Implement retention policies for historical scan data with options for compression and pruning
   - Support for defining scan boundaries, exclusion patterns, and resource utilization limits during scans

2. **Cross-server aggregation dashboard data model**
   - Generate comprehensive data structures representing holistic storage metrics across the entire infrastructure
   - Support for server grouping by role, department, location, or custom tags
   - Enable comparative analysis between servers and server groups with statistical variance reporting

3. **Monitoring platform integration interfaces**
   - Develop API interfaces compatible with enterprise monitoring platforms (Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Implement standardized alerting data formats for unified monitoring
   - Support for customizable thresholds and alert severity levels based on storage metrics

4. **Role-based access control framework**
   - Create a robust authorization system controlling read/write/execute permissions to reports and configurations
   - Implement hierarchical permission model supporting both individual users and group-based controls
   - Maintain detailed audit logs of all permission changes and access attempts

5. **Predictive analytics engine**
   - Develop time-series analysis algorithms to forecast storage growth based on historical patterns
   - Implement multiple prediction models with confidence scoring for various growth scenarios
   - Create actionable recommendations for hardware procurement based on predicted capacity needs

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability**: All components must have comprehensive unit and integration tests, including mocked file systems and time-series data for prediction testing
- **Performance**: Scanning operations must be optimized to minimize system impact, employing parallel processing where appropriate
- **Scalability**: The solution must efficiently handle hundreds of servers and millions of files without performance degradation
- **Data Integrity**: Implement checksums and validation for all stored historical data
- **Security**: All data must be handled securely with proper encryption for sensitive information

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
1. **Filesystem Scanning Engine**
   - Efficient recursive directory scanning optimized for minimal system impact
   - File metadata collection including size, timestamps, permissions, and ownership
   - Configurable scanning policies with exclusion filters and resource throttling

2. **Time-Series Data Management**
   - Storage and retrieval of historical scan data with efficient compression
   - Automated enforcement of retention policies based on age and significance
   - Delta analysis between scan points to identify changes and trends

3. **Cross-Server Analytics Engine**
   - Aggregation algorithms for consolidating data across multiple servers
   - Statistical analysis of usage patterns, outliers, and growth trajectories
   - Classification and categorization of storage consumers by type, owner, and growth rate

4. **Integration Framework**
   - Standardized interfaces for monitoring tool integration (REST API, SNMP, etc.)
   - Alert and notification system with configurable thresholds and conditions
   - Data export capabilities in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Prometheus metrics, etc.)

5. **Predictive Modeling System**
   - Time-series analysis algorithms for storage growth projection
   - Machine learning models for identifying cyclic patterns and anomalies
   - Confidence-scored predictions with multiple scenario modeling

## Testing Requirements
- **Scan Engine Testing**
  - Test with various file system structures including extremely deep hierarchies
  - Verify handling of special files (symlinks, device files, named pipes)
  - Validate resource throttling and constraint adherence
  - Test recovery from interrupted scans

- **Data Management Testing**
  - Verify data integrity through checksums and validation routines
  - Test retention policy enforcement and data lifecycle management
  - Validate compression and storage efficiency
  - Verify performance with large historical datasets

- **Analytics Testing**
  - Test statistical accuracy of aggregation algorithms
  - Validate outlier detection using known anomalous datasets
  - Benchmark performance with large multi-server datasets
  - Verify mathematical correctness of all analytical methods

- **Integration Testing**
  - Test compatibility with mock implementations of Nagios, Prometheus, and Grafana interfaces
  - Validate alert generation against defined thresholds
  - Verify correct data transformation for each target system

- **Prediction Testing**
  - Validate prediction accuracy using historical data with known outcomes
  - Test with various growth patterns (linear, exponential, seasonal)
  - Verify confidence scoring accuracy and calibration
  - Test model adaptation to changing growth patterns

## Success Criteria
1. Accurately forecast storage capacity needs with 90%+ confidence at least 60 days in advance
2. Successfully integrate with at least three major monitoring platforms (Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana)
3. Demonstrate scan efficiency with <5% system resource utilization during scanning operations
4. Process and analyze data from 200+ servers with sub-minute query response times
5. Achieve 99%+ accuracy in identifying storage usage patterns and trends
6. Provide comprehensive role-based access controls that pass security audit requirements
