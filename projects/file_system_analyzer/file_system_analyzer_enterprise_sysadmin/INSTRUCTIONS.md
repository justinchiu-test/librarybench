# Enterprise Storage Analytics System

A storage infrastructure monitoring and analytics library tailored for large-scale enterprise environments

## Overview

The Enterprise Storage Analytics System is a specialized file system analysis library designed for system administrators managing large enterprise storage infrastructures. It provides automated storage monitoring, historical trend analysis, cross-server aggregation, and predictive analytics to prevent capacity-related outages before they impact business operations.

## Persona Description

Alex is a senior systems administrator managing storage infrastructure for a multinational corporation with hundreds of servers. His primary goal is to proactively identify storage trends and prevent capacity-related outages before they impact business operations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automated Scheduled Scanning with Historical Data Retention**
   - Create a scheduler component that can automate file system scans according to configurable schedules (hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Implement configurable retention policies for historical scan data with compression options for older data
   - This feature is critical for Alex because manual scanning across hundreds of servers is impractical, and historical data allows for trend analysis to predict future problems

2. **Cross-Server Aggregation Dashboard Data**
   - Develop a data aggregation engine that can collect and correlate storage metrics from multiple servers
   - Create exportable data structures for holistic storage metrics across the entire infrastructure
   - This feature is essential because Alex needs a centralized view of storage usage across hundreds of servers to identify systemic problems and usage patterns

3. **Enterprise Monitoring Platform Integration**
   - Design APIs to integrate with common enterprise monitoring platforms (Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Implement standardized alert messaging for unified alerting
   - This integration is crucial for Alex to incorporate storage alerts into the company's existing monitoring infrastructure rather than maintaining a separate alert system

4. **Role-Based Access Control for Reports**
   - Implement a role-based permission system that controls access to report generation and configuration
   - Provide mechanisms to restrict junior admins to view-only access without modification privileges
   - This feature is important for Alex's team structure where senior admins need to delegate monitoring tasks without granting full administrative privileges

5. **Predictive Analytics for Storage Forecasting**
   - Develop statistical models that analyze historical storage growth to forecast future needs
   - Create procurement recommendation engine based on predicted storage requirements
   - This capability is vital for Alex to justify budget requests with data-driven forecasts and prevent capacity-related outages through proactive hardware procurement

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be designed with dependency injection to allow mocking of filesystem access and time-based functions
- Virtual filesystem implementation for testing without real storage systems
- Test fixtures for simulating historical data patterns
- Statistical models must be tested against known growth patterns to verify prediction accuracy
- API interfaces should include mock servers for testing integration points

### Performance Expectations
- Scan operations should support parallel processing to handle multi-terabyte storage environments
- Aggregation operations must scale to handle data from 500+ servers simultaneously
- Database operations should be optimized for time-series data
- Historical data should use efficient compression to minimize storage requirements
- Query performance should remain below 10-second response time even with 5+ years of historical data

### Integration Points
- Enterprise monitoring systems (Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana) via standard APIs
- Alerting systems via email, SMS, and messaging platforms
- Storage management systems for automatic provisioning recommendations
- Authentication systems (LDAP, Active Directory) for role-based access
- Backup systems to schedule scans outside of backup windows

### Key Constraints
- Must be suitable for air-gapped environments with no internet access
- Storage impact of the analysis tool itself must be minimal (<1% of monitored storage)
- CPU and memory usage must be configurable to limit impact on production systems
- Must support both Windows and Linux environments
- Must operate without elevated privileges when possible for security reasons

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Enterprise Storage Analytics System includes:

1. A scalable filesystem scanner that can efficiently traverse and analyze terabytes of data across multiple servers
2. A time-series database component to store and query historical storage metrics
3. An aggregation engine that consolidates metrics across server boundaries for unified analysis
4. A statistical analysis module that identifies trends and anomalies in storage usage
5. A predictive modeling system that forecasts future storage requirements based on historical patterns
6. A report generation engine that produces standardized outputs for different stakeholders
7. An alerting system that integrates with enterprise monitoring platforms to notify of potential issues
8. A role-based access control system to manage permissions for different administrative levels
9. A scheduling system to automate regular scans and reports
10. An API layer allowing integration with other enterprise systems

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Filesystem scanning accuracy compared to known reference systems
- Historical data retention and compression effectiveness
- Cross-server aggregation accuracy and performance
- Alerting system reliability and timing
- Prediction accuracy of storage forecasting
- Role-based permission enforcement
- Scheduler reliability across long time periods
- Integration with external monitoring systems

### Critical User Scenarios
- Daily scanning of 500+ servers without performance impact
- Accurate prediction of storage exhaustion 90+ days in advance
- Correct aggregation of mixed storage types (SAN, NAS, local disk)
- Proper access limitation for junior administrators
- Successful automated alerting when thresholds are approached
- Accurate identification of growth anomalies (sudden increases in usage)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete scan of 10TB filesystem in <4 hours
- Cross-server aggregation of 500 servers in <15 minutes
- Data compression achieving at least 10:1 ratio for historical data
- Query performance <10 seconds for 5-year trend analysis
- Alert generation <60 seconds from threshold breach detection
- Prediction model accuracy within 10% for 90-day forecasts

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitions between scanners and aggregation services
- Database corruption recovery
- Handling of scanner interruption and resumption
- Very large files (>100GB) scanning performance
- Extremely deep directory structures (>20 levels)
- Files with restricted permissions or access issues
- Storage systems nearing 100% capacity
- Sudden drastic changes in storage usage patterns

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core scanning and analysis logic
- 100% coverage of error handling paths
- 100% coverage of permission checking code
- Performance testing across all specified benchmarks
- Integration testing with all supported monitoring platforms
- Chaos testing for handling unexpected system failures

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when it:

1. Successfully predicts storage capacity exhaustion at least 60 days in advance with 90% accuracy
2. Reduces manual storage auditing time by at least 80%
3. Provides cross-server storage visibility through a single unified data structure
4. Integrates seamlessly with at least three major enterprise monitoring platforms
5. Enforces role-based access controls that comply with separation of duties requirements
