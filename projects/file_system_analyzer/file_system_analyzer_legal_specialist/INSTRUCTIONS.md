# Legal E-Discovery File Analysis System

## Overview
A specialized file system analysis library for legal e-discovery that enables efficient searching, analysis, and export of relevant documents from massive corporate archives. This solution provides advanced query capabilities, legally defensible exports, and comprehensive document timeline analysis.

## Persona Description
Jessica works for a law firm handling e-discovery requests that require searching through massive corporate archives. She needs to efficiently identify and export relevant documents while maintaining chain of custody.

## Key Requirements
1. **Advanced query language for complex file selection**
   - Develop a powerful, flexible query language that combines metadata and content criteria
   - Support complex boolean logic, proximity searches, and fuzzy matching
   - Enable time-based constraints and relationship queries
   - Include support for iterative query refinement and result filtering

2. **Legally defensible export functionality**
   - Implement export mechanisms that preserve all relevant metadata and chain of custody
   - Create comprehensive documentation of search parameters, processing steps, and results
   - Support for various export formats suitable for legal review platforms
   - Ensure cryptographic verification and tamper-evident packaging of exported data

3. **Document duplicate detection system**
   - Develop sophisticated algorithms for identifying exact and near-duplicate documents
   - Detect documents with minor variations, different formats, or partial content matches
   - Group related documents by similarity and relationship
   - Enable content-based clustering to identify thematically related materials

4. **Timeline visualization data model**
   - Create data structures representing document creation, modification, and access patterns
   - Enable filtering and analysis based on relevant case timeframes
   - Support for detection of anomalous temporal patterns (e.g., mass deletions, unusual access)
   - Develop temporal clustering to identify related document activities

5. **Legal document management system integration**
   - Design APIs compatible with popular legal document management systems
   - Implement standardized data exchange formats for seamless workflow integration
   - Support for preservation of hierarchical relationships and metadata
   - Enable bidirectional synchronization of tagging and annotations

## Technical Requirements
- **Accuracy**: Search and identification algorithms must achieve high precision and recall (above 95%)
- **Defensibility**: All processes must be fully documented and legally defensible in court
- **Performance**: Must efficiently process multi-terabyte document collections within reasonable timeframes
- **Scalability**: Architecture must scale to handle extremely large document sets (100M+ files)
- **Security**: Must maintain strict confidentiality and access controls for sensitive legal materials

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
1. **Advanced Query Engine**
   - Lexical analysis and parsing for query language
   - Metadata and full-text search capabilities
   - Query optimization and execution planning
   - Result relevance scoring and ranking

2. **Legal Export Framework**
   - Chain of custody preservation
   - Comprehensive process documentation
   - Format conversion and packaging
   - Cryptographic verification systems

3. **Duplicate Analysis System**
   - Content-based similarity algorithms
   - Near-duplicate detection and grouping
   - Version and derivative identification
   - Relationship mapping between documents

4. **Temporal Analysis Engine**
   - Timestamp extraction and normalization
   - Activity pattern detection and analysis
   - Anomaly identification in temporal data
   - Timeline correlation and clustering

5. **Integration Framework**
   - API interfaces for legal systems
   - Standardized data exchange formats
   - Relationship preservation mechanisms
   - Synchronization and notification systems

## Testing Requirements
- **Query Engine Testing**
  - Test query parsing with various complexity levels
  - Validate search accuracy with benchmark document collections
  - Verify handling of edge cases and malformed queries
  - Benchmark performance with large document sets

- **Export Testing**
  - Test chain of custody preservation under various scenarios
  - Validate documentation completeness and accuracy
  - Verify format compliance with legal review platforms
  - Test cryptographic verification systems

- **Duplicate Detection Testing**
  - Test with known sets of exact and near-duplicates
  - Validate precision and recall metrics for similarity detection
  - Verify performance with large document collections
  - Test with various document formats and content types

- **Temporal Analysis Testing**
  - Test timestamp extraction from various file formats
  - Validate pattern detection with known temporal sequences
  - Verify anomaly detection with simulated suspicious activities
  - Test timeline visualization data model with complex datasets

- **Integration Testing**
  - Test with mock implementations of legal document systems
  - Validate data exchange format compliance
  - Verify relationship preservation across systems
  - Test synchronization under various scenarios

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully identify relevant documents with at least 95% precision and 90% recall
2. Generate legally defensible exports that maintain complete chain of custody documentation
3. Identify at least 98% of duplicate and near-duplicate documents with less than 2% false positives
4. Accurately reconstruct document timelines and detect temporal anomalies with 90%+ accuracy
5. Seamlessly integrate with at least three major legal document management systems
6. Process and analyze document collections up to 10TB in size within 24 hours
