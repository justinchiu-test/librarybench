# Media Asset Storage Optimizer

A specialized file system analysis library for media production professionals to manage, analyze, and optimize digital media assets storage

## Overview

The Media Asset Storage Optimizer is a specialized file system analysis library designed for media production environments working with large video, audio, and image files. It provides media-specific metadata extraction, project-based organization analysis, render farm storage efficiency metrics, bandwidth analysis, and content-aware deduplication to optimize storage workflows in media production environments.

## Persona Description

Carlos oversees digital assets for a media production company working with large video, audio, and image files. His goal is to optimize storage workflows and ensure efficient organization of media projects.

## Key Requirements

1. **Media-Specific Metadata Extraction and Cataloging**
   - Implement specialized metadata extractors for video, audio, and image files
   - Create a cataloging system that indexes technical attributes like resolution, bitrate, codec, and color profiles
   - This feature is critical for Carlos because media files have specialized technical characteristics that general file analysis tools cannot properly interpret, leading to inefficient organization and difficulty in locating specific assets by their technical properties

2. **Project-Based Analysis and Orphaned Asset Detection**
   - Develop organization analysis algorithms that group files by production timeline and project structure
   - Create detection mechanisms for identifying orphaned assets no longer associated with active projects
   - This capability is essential because media projects generate numerous temporary and derivative files, and identifying which assets are still needed versus which can be archived or removed saves substantial storage space

3. **Render Farm Storage Efficiency Metrics**
   - Implement analytics that correlate output quality settings with storage requirements
   - Create visualization tools for understanding storage impact of different rendering configurations
   - This feature is vital for Carlos because render farms generate massive amounts of output data, and understanding how quality settings affect storage needs helps optimize the tradeoff between quality and storage consumption

4. **Bandwidth Analysis for Storage Subsystems**
   - Design tools to analyze storage bandwidth requirements for media workflows
   - Create metrics to ensure storage performance matches media playback and editing needs
   - This functionality is critical because media production requires high-bandwidth storage, and mismatches between storage performance and media file requirements lead to workflow bottlenecks and productivity loss

5. **Content-Aware Media Deduplication**
   - Develop specialized deduplication algorithms designed for slight variations in media files
   - Create visual comparison tools for near-duplicate media assets
   - This feature is crucial for Carlos because media workflows often generate multiple similar versions of assets with minor differences, and standard deduplication tools cannot effectively identify these near-duplicates, leading to substantial wasted storage

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Test fixtures with various media formats and metadata combinations
- Mock media project structures with known relationships
- Synthetic render output datasets for efficiency testing
- Benchmark datasets for storage bandwidth analysis
