# Open Source Repository Analytics System

## Overview
A specialized file system analysis library for open source project maintainers that provides insights into repository organization, contributor impact, and dependency management. This solution helps optimize project structure, ensure license compliance, and improve the experience for new contributors.

## Persona Description
Raj maintains several popular open source projects and needs to ensure the repositories remain efficient and well-organized. His goal is to understand how the project structure impacts new contributors and identify areas for optimization.

## Key Requirements
1. **Contributor impact analysis**
   - Develop analytics to measure how different developers affect repository size and organization
   - Track changes to project structure and file organization by contributor
   - Identify patterns in contribution styles and their effects on repository health
   - Generate insights on how contribution patterns affect project maintainability

2. **Cross-repository comparison framework**
   - Implement tools to highlight structural differences between similar projects
   - Compare organizational approaches, directory structures, and file distributions
   - Analyze differences in build artifacts, documentation, and testing approaches
   - Provide benchmarking against industry best practices for repository organization

3. **License compliance scanning system**
   - Create detection algorithms for identifying license information across the codebase
   - Flag missing, incomplete, or potentially incompatible license declarations
   - Track license coverage across all project components and dependencies
   - Generate compliance reports and remediation recommendations

4. **Dependency tree visualization model**
   - Develop a comprehensive dependency analysis framework
   - Track storage impact of included libraries and frameworks
   - Identify redundant, outdated, or security-vulnerable dependencies
   - Create optimization recommendations for dependency management

5. **Newcomer experience metrics**
   - Design metrics to evaluate the project's approachability for new contributors
   - Identify areas of the codebase that might confuse new contributors due to organization
   - Analyze documentation completeness relative to codebase complexity
   - Generate recommendations for improving navigation and onboarding experience

## Technical Requirements
- **Integration**: Must seamlessly integrate with common version control systems (Git, GitHub/GitLab APIs)
- **Accuracy**: Analysis and recommendations must be based on established open source best practices
- **Performance**: Must efficiently handle large repositories with complex histories
- **Extensibility**: Architecture must support easy addition of new analysis metrics and recommendations
- **Security**: Must respect access controls and securely handle repository content

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Commit history processing and attribution
   - Structural impact assessment algorithms
   - Pattern recognition for contribution styles
   - Maintainability impact scoring

2. **Repository Comparison Framework**
   - Structure similarity algorithms
   - Directory tree comparison tools
   - Best practice benchmarking system
   - Organization pattern analysis

3. **License Management System**
   - License detection and identification
   - Compatibility analysis algorithms
   - Coverage tracking and reporting
   - Remediation recommendation engine

4. **Dependency Analysis Framework**
   - Dependency discovery and tracking
   - Storage impact calculation
   - Redundancy and vulnerability detection
   - Optimization recommendation system

5. **Newcomer Experience Analyzer**
   - Complexity measurement algorithms
   - Documentation coverage analysis
   - Navigation path complexity metrics
   - Onboarding improvement suggestions

## Testing Requirements
- **Contributor Analysis Testing**
  - Test with repositories having diverse contributor patterns
  - Validate attribution accuracy with known contribution histories
  - Verify impact assessments against manually analyzed repositories
  - Test with various project sizes and team compositions

- **Repository Comparison Testing**
  - Test comparison algorithms with known similar and dissimilar projects
  - Validate structure similarity metrics against expert assessments
  - Verify benchmarking accuracy against established best practices
  - Test with repositories of varying complexity and organization

- **License Testing**
  - Test license detection with various license formats and declarations
  - Validate compatibility analysis with known license combinations
  - Verify coverage tracking with mixed-license repositories
  - Test remediation recommendations against expert solutions

- **Dependency Testing**
  - Test discovery algorithms with various dependency management systems
  - Validate impact calculations against actual storage measurements
  - Verify vulnerability detection against known CVE databases
  - Test optimization recommendations with complex dependency trees

- **Newcomer Experience Testing**
  - Test complexity metrics with repositories of varying approachability
  - Validate documentation coverage analysis with expert assessments
  - Verify navigation complexity metrics against new contributor surveys
  - Test improvement suggestions against established onboarding best practices

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully identify and analyze contributor impact patterns with 90%+ accuracy
2. Generate meaningful structural comparisons between repositories that align with expert assessments
3. Identify at least 98% of license compliance issues with recommendations for resolution
4. Accurately map dependency relationships and their storage impact within 5% margin of error
5. Generate newcomer experience metrics that correlate strongly with actual contributor feedback
6. Process and analyze repositories with 10+ years of history and thousands of contributors
