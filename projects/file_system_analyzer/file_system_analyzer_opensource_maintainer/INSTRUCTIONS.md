# Open Source Repository Analyzer

A specialized file system analysis library for open source project maintainers to optimize repository structure and improve contributor experience

## Overview

The Open Source Repository Analyzer is a specialized library designed for open source project maintainers to analyze, optimize, and improve project repository organization. It provides contributor impact analysis, cross-repository comparison, license compliance scanning, dependency tree visualization, and newcomer experience metrics to enhance repository structure and facilitate easier contribution from new developers.

## Persona Description

Raj maintains several popular open source projects and needs to ensure the repositories remain efficient and well-organized. His goal is to understand how the project structure impacts new contributors and identify areas for optimization.

## Key Requirements

1. **Contributor Impact Analysis**
   - Implement analytics to evaluate how different developers affect repository size and organization
   - Create visualization tools for understanding contributor impact patterns
   - This feature is critical for Raj because understanding how different contributors influence repository structure helps identify both positive practices to encourage and potentially problematic patterns that affect project maintainability

2. **Cross-Repository Comparison**
   - Develop tools to compare structure, organization, and patterns across similar projects
   - Create benchmarking capabilities for repository organization best practices
   - This capability is essential because comparing project organization with similar successful repositories helps identify structural improvements that align with community standards and expectations

3. **License Compliance Scanning**
   - Implement detection of incompatible or missing license information
   - Create validation against open source licensing requirements
   - This feature is vital for Raj because open source projects must maintain clear licensing to be usable by others, and detecting license issues early prevents legal complications and ensures project adoption

4. **Dependency Tree Visualization**
   - Design analytics to show storage impact of included libraries and frameworks
   - Create visualization of dependency relationships and their footprint
   - This functionality is critical because dependencies significantly impact repository size and complexity, and understanding their storage footprint helps maintain an efficient project structure

5. **Newcomer Experience Metrics**
   - Implement analysis to identify areas of the codebase that might confuse new contributors
   - Create metrics for evaluating repository organization friendliness
   - This feature is crucial for Raj because improving the experience for new contributors is essential for project growth and sustainability, and quantifying organizational barriers helps prioritize improvements

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Mock repositories with controlled contributor patterns
- Synthetic project structures for organization analysis
- Test fixtures with various license scenarios
- Parameterized tests for different repository types
- Verification of metrics against known repository patterns
- Integration testing with actual version control systems

### Performance Expectations
- Support for repositories up to 10GB in size
- Analysis completion in under 30 minutes for large repositories
- Efficient handling of repositories with 10,000+ commits
- Support for analyzing multiple repositories in parallel
- Memory-efficient processing to support large project histories
- Minimal impact on local development environments

### Integration Points
- Version control systems (Git, Mercurial, SVN)
- GitHub, GitLab, and other hosting platforms
- Package management systems for dependencies
- License scanning tools and databases
- Contribution analytics platforms
- Documentation generation systems

### Key Constraints
- Analysis must be non-destructive to repositories
- Support for various open source project types (libraries, applications, frameworks)
- Cross-platform compatibility for diverse contributor environments
- Handle multilingual codebases with mixed programming languages
- Support for both centralized and distributed version control
- Privacy-respecting analysis of contributor patterns

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Open Source Repository Analyzer includes:

1. A contributor analysis system that evaluates impact on repository structure
2. A cross-repository comparison engine for benchmarking against similar projects
3. A license compliance scanner that detects and validates licensing information
4. A dependency analyzer that evaluates storage impact and relationships
5. A newcomer experience evaluation system to identify contribution barriers
6. A repository structure visualization engine
7. A metric collection system for quantifying organizational aspects
8. A recommendation engine for repository optimization
9. A historical analysis component for tracking organizational changes over time
10. An API for integration with version control platforms and hosting services

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of contributor impact assessment
- Correctness of cross-repository comparisons
- Reliability of license compliance detection
- Precision of dependency tree analysis
- Validity of newcomer experience metrics
- Performance with large repositories
- Accuracy of recommendations for repository optimization

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing how specific contributors have influenced repository structure
- Comparing repository organization with similar successful projects
- Identifying licensing issues across the codebase
- Understanding storage impact of dependencies
- Evaluating repository organization for newcomer-friendliness
- Tracking organizational improvements over time
- Generating actionable recommendations for optimization

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete repository analysis in under 30 minutes for 10GB repositories
- Support for repositories with 10,000+ commits and 1,000+ contributors
- Cross-repository comparison of 10+ repositories in under 60 minutes
- License scanning at a rate of at least 1,000 files per minute
- Dependency analysis completion in under 15 minutes for complex projects
- Memory usage under 4GB for standard operations

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling repositories with unusual structures
- Managing analysis of monorepo projects
- Processing repositories with complex submodule structures
- Dealing with mixed version control systems
- Handling incomplete or corrupted repository histories
- Processing repositories with non-standard licensing
- Managing analysis of highly distributed project structures

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >90% coverage of contributor analysis algorithms
- 100% coverage of license scanning functionality
- Comprehensive testing of dependency analysis logic
- Thorough testing of newcomer metrics calculation
- Complete verification of cross-repository comparison
- Full testing of recommendation generation
- Validation against actual open source repositories of different types

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when it:

1. Accurately identifies how different contributors impact repository organization
2. Provides meaningful comparisons between similar projects to highlight structural differences
3. Detects license compliance issues with at least 95% accuracy
4. Clearly visualizes dependency relationships and their storage impact
5. Identifies areas of the codebase that present barriers for new contributors
6. Generates specific, actionable recommendations for repository optimization
7. Effectively analyzes repositories from various domains and programming languages
8. Provides metrics that can track organizational improvements over time
9. Integrates with common open source project workflows and platforms
10. Demonstrably improves the contributor experience when recommendations are implemented

To get started with development:

1. Use `uv init --lib` to set up the project structure and create pyproject.toml
2. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run development tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run individual tests with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Execute modules with `uv run python -m opensource_repo_analyzer.module_name`
