# Sensitive Data Discovery and Compliance Analyzer

A specialized file system analysis library for security auditors to detect, track, and report on sensitive data for regulatory compliance

## Overview

The Sensitive Data Discovery and Compliance Analyzer is a specialized file system analysis library that helps security auditors identify potentially sensitive information stored in unauthorized locations, verify data retention policy compliance, and generate comprehensive audit reports for regulatory frameworks. It provides pattern-based scanning, immutable audit logging, compliance reporting, differential analysis, and cryptographic verification for exported reports.

## Persona Description

Priya works as an information security specialist conducting regular audits for regulatory compliance. She needs to identify potentially sensitive files stored in unauthorized locations and verify that data retention policies are being properly enforced.

## Key Requirements

1. **Pattern-Based Sensitive Data Detection**
   - Implement content scanning capabilities to detect personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data based on configurable content signatures
   - Support for regular expressions, checksums, entropy analysis, and other detection methods
   - This feature is critical for Priya because manually searching for sensitive data across large file systems is impractical, and automated detection significantly improves the accuracy of compliance audits

2. **Comprehensive Audit Logging System**
   - Design an immutable logging mechanism that records all scan operations with cryptographic verification
   - Provide detailed audit trails suitable for compliance evidence
   - This capability is essential because security audits require verifiable evidence that scanning was performed correctly and completely, with logs that cannot be tampered with after the fact

3. **Customizable Compliance Report Templates**
   - Create a flexible reporting engine that generates compliance documentation mapped to specific regulatory frameworks
   - Support for multiple frameworks including GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and others
   - This feature is vital for Priya because different audits require different reporting formats, and having standardized templates ensures consistency and completeness

4. **Differential Scanning for New Sensitive Content**
   - Implement capabilities to compare current scan results with previous audits
   - Highlight newly added sensitive content since previous scans
   - This functionality is critical for ongoing compliance monitoring, allowing Priya to quickly identify new compliance risks without reassessing previously cleared content

5. **Chain-of-Custody Tracking for Reports**
   - Develop cryptographic verification for exported reports
   - Implement digital signatures and verification mechanisms
   - This feature is crucial for maintaining the integrity of audit findings, ensuring that exported reports cannot be modified without detection and providing a verifiable chain of evidence for regulatory purposes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All sensitive data detection algorithms must be testable with synthetic data
- Mock file systems with controlled sensitive data patterns
- Verification of detection accuracy with known test cases
- Simulation of various file formats containing sensitive data
- Testing of cryptographic signature verification

### Performance Expectations
- Scan rates of at least 50GB per hour on standard hardware
- Support for distributed scanning to increase throughput on large file systems
- Memory efficient pattern matching that can handle terabytes of data
- Resource throttling to minimize impact on production systems
- Optimized scanning algorithms that can skip known-safe file types
- Incremental scanning capabilities to reduce subsequent scan times

### Integration Points
- Regulatory compliance management systems
- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Data loss prevention (DLP) platforms
- Enterprise document management systems
- Digital signature and certificate management systems
- Existing security audit frameworks and tools

### Key Constraints
- Must not exfiltrate any sensitive data during scanning or reporting
- All sensitive data references must be securely hashed in logs and reports
- Analysis processes must be transparent and documentable for audit purposes
- Compliance with legal requirements for digital evidence
- Support for air-gapped environments with no external connectivity
- All operations must be non-destructive and read-only

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Sensitive Data Discovery and Compliance Analyzer includes:

1. A pattern-based scanning engine that can detect various types of sensitive data (PII, financial data, health information, etc.)
2. A cryptographically secured audit logging system that maintains tamper-evident records of all operations
3. A compliance reporting engine that generates documentation mapped to specific regulatory frameworks
4. A differential analysis system that compares current scan results with previous audits
5. A chain-of-custody system that ensures the integrity of exported reports through cryptographic verification
6. A classification engine that categorizes detected sensitive data according to regulatory requirements
7. A policy verification system that checks compliance with data retention and storage policies
8. A secure API for integration with other security and compliance systems
