# File System Analyzer Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for refactoring the file system analyzer libraries to create a unified common library that can be used by both personas: the Database Admin and the Security Auditor.

## 1. Common Patterns Identified

After analyzing both implementations, the following common patterns were identified:

### 1.1 Core Scanning Functionality
- Both implementations scan directories recursively for files
- Both apply filtering rules to include/exclude certain files
- Both collect file metadata (size, creation time, modification time)
- Both have pattern-based detection mechanisms
- Both use multithreaded processing for efficiency
- Both need to handle large directory structures efficiently

### 1.2 Common Data Structures
- File metadata representation
- Scan options/configuration
- Results aggregation and reporting
- Pattern definitions with categories and severity/priority
- Scan results with common attributes (file info, matches, timestamps)

### 1.3 Common Utilities
- File utility functions (size calculation, stat collection)
- Path manipulation and filtering
- Crypto/hashing utilities for file integrity
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, HTML)

### 1.4 Common Patterns in Testing
- Tests for pattern detection
- Tests for directory scanning
- Tests for result aggregation
- Mock file system generation

## 2. Core Architecture

The unified library will be organized as follows:

```

│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py            # Core base classes and interfaces
