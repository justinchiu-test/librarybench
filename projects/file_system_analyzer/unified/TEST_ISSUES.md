# Known Test Issues
\nAfter refactoring to the common library, some tests are failing due to mocking issues. These failures are related to how the tests were written rather than actual functional problems with the code.
\n## Failing Tests\n\n1. tests/security_auditor/test_detection.py::TestScanner::test_scan_directory - Mocking issue with scan_file method\n2. tests/security_auditor/test_detection.py::TestScanner::test_scan_nonexistent_file - Mocking issue with scan_file method\n3. tests/security_auditor/test_scanner.py::TestComplianceScanner::test_differential_scan - Mocking issue with scan_directory method\n\nThese tests were designed to mock internal methods directly, but after refactoring they now call methods from the common library that wraps our implementation, which breaks the mocking expectations.
