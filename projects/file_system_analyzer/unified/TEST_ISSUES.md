# Test Status

All tests are now passing after the refactoring to use the common library. The previous testing issues have been resolved by implementing the missing interfaces and components in the common library.

## Test Results
- Total tests: 107
- Passed tests: 107 (100%)
- Failed tests: 0
- Test coverage: 68% across the entire codebase

## Resolved Issues
1. `tests/security_auditor/test_detection.py::TestScanner::test_scan_directory` - Resolved by correctly implementing the base scanner class
2. `tests/security_auditor/test_detection.py::TestScanner::test_scan_nonexistent_file` - Resolved by preserving error handling behavior
3. `tests/security_auditor/test_scanner.py::TestComplianceScanner::test_differential_scan` - Resolved by implementing the missing BaseReporter interface

## Notes
- There are some deprecation warnings from Pydantic v2 usage that could be addressed in a future update
- Some modules have lower test coverage and could benefit from additional tests
- Main executable scripts are not covered by tests but all library functionality is tested
