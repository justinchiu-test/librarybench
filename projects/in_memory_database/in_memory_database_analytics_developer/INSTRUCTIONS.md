# LiveViewDB: In-Memory Database for Real-Time Analytics Dashboards

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database designed for powering interactive business intelligence dashboards with live data, focusing on materialized views, efficient caching strategies, and multi-tenant isolation to deliver responsive analytical capabilities without impacting transactional performance.

## Persona Description
Elena builds interactive dashboards for business intelligence showing live data. She needs to support concurrent analytical queries without impacting transactional performance.

## Key Requirements

1. **Materialized view maintenance with incremental updates**
   - Critical for providing pre-computed results for common dashboard queries
   - Must implement materialized views that update incrementally as underlying data changes
   - Should support complex aggregations, window functions, and multi-table joins
   - Must include dependency tracking to cascade updates appropriately
   - Should provide monitoring and metrics for view freshness and update performance

2. **Time-window caching strategies for report periods**
   - Essential for efficiently serving time-based reports with different granularities
   - Must implement caching for common time periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
   - Should support sliding windows and calendar-aligned periods (week-to-date, month-to-date, etc.)
   - Must include automatic invalidation based on data changes and time progression
   - Should provide configurable trade-offs between freshness and performance

3. **Progressive query results with initial approximations**
   - Vital for responsive dashboards when dealing with large datasets
   - Must support streaming initial approximations that refine as computation completes
   - Should implement sampling techniques for quick estimates on aggregate queries
   - Must include confidence intervals or error bounds with approximate results
   - Should provide user experience oriented timeouts and refinement strategies

4. **Multi-tenant isolation for performance stability**
   - Important for enterprise dashboards serving multiple business units or customers
   - Must implement resource isolation between tenants to prevent noisy neighbor problems
   - Should support configurable resource allocation and query priorities
   - Must include monitoring and alerting for tenant resource usage
   - Should provide throttling mechanisms for preventing tenant monopolization

5. **Visual query builder integration with cost estimation**
   - Critical for empowering business users to create effective dashboards
   - Must provide query analysis with cost and performance estimation
   - Should offer alternative query suggestions for improving performance
   - Must include explain plans in user-friendly formats
   - Should support query templates with parameterization for common dashboard patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be thoroughly testable with pytest
- Tests must verify materialized view consistency with underlying data changes
- Caching tests must validate correctness and performance for various time windows
- Progressive query tests must confirm approximation accuracy and refinement behavior
- Multi-tenant tests must verify proper isolation under concurrent load

### Performance Expectations
- Dashboard queries must return initial results in under 200ms even for large datasets
- Materialized view updates must complete within 1 second of underlying data changes
- Cached time-window queries must return in under 50ms for common periods
- Query cost estimation must complete in under 100ms with 90% accuracy
- System must maintain performance guarantees even with 100+ concurrent users

### Integration Points
- Must provide Python APIs for integration with dashboard frameworks
- Should support standard BI connection protocols (ODBC, JDBC)
- Must include connectors for popular visualization libraries and tools
- Should offer hooks for custom metrics and analytics extensions

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - purely APIs and libraries for integration into dashboards
- Must operate without external database dependencies - self-contained Python library
- All operations must prioritize read performance while maintaining data freshness
- Must support multi-tenant deployment scenarios with proper isolation

## Core Functionality

The implementation must provide:

1. **Materialized View Engine**
   - Definition and management of pre-computed result sets
   - Incremental update mechanisms for efficient maintenance
   - Dependency tracking between views and base data
   - Freshness monitoring and update scheduling

2. **Time-Window Cache System**
   - Specialized caching for time-based reporting periods
   - Automatic cache management for sliding windows
   - Calendar-aligned period support for business reporting
   - Cache invalidation and refresh strategies

3. **Progressive Query Framework**
   - Approximate query processing with result streaming
   - Sampling techniques for large dataset estimation
   - Confidence interval calculation for approximations
   - Query cancellation and early termination support

4. **Multi-Tenant Resource Manager**
   - Workload isolation between tenants
   - Resource allocation and query prioritization
   - Usage monitoring and quota enforcement
   - Performance guarantee mechanisms

5. **Query Analysis Tools**
   - Cost estimation for complex analytical queries
   - Performance optimization suggestions
   - User-friendly query explanation
   - Parameterized template support for common patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Consistency of materialized views with underlying data
- Correctness of time-window caches for various reporting periods
- Accuracy of progressive query approximations
- Effectiveness of multi-tenant isolation under load
- Precision of query cost estimation and optimization

### Critical User Scenarios
- Interactive dashboard usage with multiple concurrent users
- Real-time data updates reflected in live dashboards
- Complex analytical queries over large datasets
- Resource-intensive operations from one tenant not affecting others
- Business users creating and modifying their own visualizations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure query response time for various complexity levels and data sizes
- Verify materialized view update latency after underlying data changes
- Benchmark time-window cache hit rates and response times
- Validate progressive query approximation quality over time
- Test system stability with simulated multi-tenant workloads

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely complex analytical queries that push system limits
- Rapid data changes affecting multiple dependent materialized views
- Resource exhaustion scenarios with many concurrent users
- Conflicting priorities among tenants with limited resources
- Invalid query constructions from visual query builders

### Required Test Coverage
- 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of materialized view consistency logic
- Comprehensive tests for cache invalidation scenarios
- Performance tests validating progressive query behavior
- Multi-tenant isolation tests with various workload patterns
