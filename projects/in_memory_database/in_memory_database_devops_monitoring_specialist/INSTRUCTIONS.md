# MetricStoreDB: High-Performance In-Memory Metrics Database

## Overview
MetricStoreDB is a specialized in-memory database designed for DevOps monitoring systems, focusing on high-throughput storage and analysis of metrics collected from thousands of cloud services. It provides optimized storage formats, multi-dimensional filtering, statistical analysis, and intelligent data retention policies essential for modern observability platforms.

## Persona Description
Carlos maintains observability systems for a cloud platform, collecting metrics from thousands of services. He needs a high-throughput solution for recent metrics that supports complex analytical queries before data is archived.

## Key Requirements

1. **Bit-Packed Storage for Metrics**
   - Implement a specialized, memory-efficient storage format for timestamp-value pairs
   - Critical for Carlos's monitoring systems which process billions of data points daily from thousands of services
   - Must optimize memory usage while maintaining query performance through bit-packing, run-length encoding, and delta compression

2. **Multi-dimensional Metrics Filtering**
   - Develop a label-based indexing system for efficient filtering across multiple dimensions
   - Essential for Carlos's platform where metrics must be filtered by service, region, instance, metric type, and other attributes
   - Should support high-cardinality label sets with minimal memory overhead and fast filtering operations

3. **Statistical Downsampling**
   - Create a downsampling system that preserves important statistical properties (min, max, avg, percentiles)
   - Vital for Carlos's long-term storage strategy where raw data must be reduced while maintaining statistical validity
   - Must support multiple resolution levels and automatic aggregation policies based on data age

4. **Alerting Expression Engine**
   - Implement an alerting expression syntax embedded within the query language
   - Important for Carlos's monitoring workflows where metric anomalies must trigger immediate operational responses
   - Should include threshold evaluation, trend analysis, and anomaly detection with minimal latency

5. **Configurable Retention Policies**
   - Develop automatic tiering to cold storage based on configurable rules
   - Critical for Carlos's data lifecycle management across hot, warm, and cold storage tiers
   - Must include flexible policy definition, automatic enforcement, and seamless query access across tiers

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Support for generating high-volume synthetic metric data
- Benchmarking tools for measuring ingest and query performance
