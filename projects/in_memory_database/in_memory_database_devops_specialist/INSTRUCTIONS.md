# MetricsDB: High-Throughput In-Memory Database for DevOps Monitoring

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database designed for collecting, storing, and analyzing high-volume metrics from thousands of cloud services with optimized storage, fast analytical queries, and intelligent data lifecycle management.

## Persona Description
Carlos maintains observability systems for a cloud platform, collecting metrics from thousands of services. He needs a high-throughput solution for recent metrics that supports complex analytical queries before data is archived.

   - Critical for efficiently storing millions of time-series metrics with minimal memory footprint
   - Must implement bit-packing techniques optimized for common metric data patterns
   - Should support various numeric types with configurable precision/compression tradeoffs
   - Must include adaptive encoding based on data characteristics (sparse/dense, range, distribution)
   - Should provide detailed memory efficiency metrics for optimization

2. **Multi-dimensional metrics filtering with label-based indexing**
   - Essential for quickly locating relevant metrics among thousands of services and dimensions
   - Must implement label-based indexing for efficient filtering by service, instance, region, etc.
   - Should support complex boolean expressions for combining multiple label conditions
   - Must include cardinality control to prevent explosion from high-cardinality labels
   - Should provide query optimization suggestions for inefficient label queries

3. **Downsampling with statistical function preservation**
   - Vital for maintaining query performance while preserving critical statistical properties

   - Must implement various aggregation methods appropriate for different metric types
   - Should include anomaly-aware downsampling that preserves significant deviations

4. **Alerting expressions embedded within query language**
   - Important for detecting and responding to operational issues in real-time
   - Must extend query language with alerting expressions and threshold definitions
   - Should support complex alert conditions incorporating multiple metrics and time windows
   - Must include hysteresis and dampening to prevent alert flapping
   - Should provide alert preview and testing capabilities

5. **Retention policies with automatic tiering**
   - Critical for managing the lifecycle of metrics data with varying retention requirements
   - Must implement configurable retention policies based on time and importance
   - Should support automatic tiering to cold storage for historical data
