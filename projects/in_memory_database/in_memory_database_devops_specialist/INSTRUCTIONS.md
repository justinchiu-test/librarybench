# MetricStore: High-Throughput In-Memory Database for DevOps Monitoring

## Overview
A specialized high-throughput in-memory database designed for storing, processing, and analyzing metrics from large-scale cloud infrastructure. This system optimizes for efficient storage of time-series metrics, multi-dimensional filtering, statistical analysis, alerting capabilities, and automatic data tiering to support DevOps observability requirements.

## Persona Description
Carlos maintains observability systems for a cloud platform, collecting metrics from thousands of services. He needs a high-throughput solution for recent metrics that supports complex analytical queries before data is archived.

## Key Requirements

1. **Bit-Packed Storage Optimization for Metrics**
   - Implementation of specialized bit-packed storage formats for timestamp-value pairs
   - Optimized compression techniques for different metric types (counters, gauges, histograms)
   - Memory-efficient indexing strategies for time-series data
   - This feature is critical for Carlos as efficient storage directly impacts the volume of metrics that can be kept in-memory for fast querying, allowing more comprehensive monitoring of cloud services without excessive hardware costs

2. **Multi-Dimensional Metrics Filtering**
   - Implementation of label-based indexing for efficient filtering of metrics by multiple dimensions
   - Support for complex boolean expressions combining multiple label criteria
   - Optimized query execution for high-cardinality label spaces
   - Cloud environments involve metrics with multiple dimensions (service, instance, region, customer, etc.), and Carlos needs to quickly filter these to isolate issues or analyze specific segments of infrastructure

3. **Statistical Downsampling with Function Preservation**
   - Implementation of downsampling algorithms that preserve important statistical properties
   - Support for various statistical functions (min, max, avg, percentiles) during downsampling
   - Configurable resolution levels for different retention periods
   - Carlos needs to analyze metric patterns over various time ranges, requiring downsampled data that accurately represents the original measurements' statistical characteristics to identify anomalies and trends

4. **Embedded Alerting Expressions**
   - Implementation of an alerting expression language embedded within the query system
   - Support for threshold-based, trend-based, and anomaly-based alert conditions
   - Efficient evaluation of alert expressions over large metric sets
   - Proactive alerting is essential for Carlos to identify and respond to infrastructure issues before they impact services, requiring expressions that can be efficiently evaluated against incoming metrics

5. **Automatic Tiering to Cold Storage**
   - Implementation of configurable retention policies for different metric categories
   - Automatic tiering of aging data to more cost-effective storage
   - Seamless query access across hot and cold data tiers
   - Carlos must balance performance and cost by keeping recent metrics in-memory while automatically archiving older data to cold storage, with consistent query access regardless of where data resides

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Compression efficiency must be measurable with different metric patterns
- Query performance must be benchmarkable across various filtering scenarios
- Downsampling accuracy must be verifiable against original data
- Alert expression evaluation must be testable with historical metric patterns
- Data tiering must be analyzable for both performance and storage efficiency

### Performance Expectations
- System must ingest at least 100,000 metric points per second
- Filtering queries must return results in under 100ms for common cases
- Downsampling operations must complete in under 500ms for 1M data points
- Alert expressions must evaluate in under 50ms against current metric state
- Data tiering must have no visible impact on query performance

### Integration Points
- Standard interfaces for metric collection systems (Prometheus, StatsD, etc.)
- Query API compatible with common visualization tools
- Alerting integration with notification systems
- Export functionality for long-term storage systems
- API for configuration and administration

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must use only Python standard library with no external dependencies
- Memory usage must be optimized for high metric volume
- The system must maintain performance as the metric volume grows
- All operations must have predictable resource usage patterns

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Metric Storage Engine**
   - Efficient in-memory storage optimized for time-series metrics
   - Specialized compression for different metric types
   - High-throughput ingestion pipeline

2. **Multi-Dimensional Query System**
   - Implementation of label-based indexing
   - Query parser and execution engine
   - Optimization for common filtering patterns

3. **Statistical Analysis Framework**
   - Implementation of statistical functions for downsampling
   - Accurate calculation of percentiles and other aggregates
   - Temporal aggregation over configurable windows

4. **Alerting Subsystem**
   - Expression language for defining alert conditions
   - Efficient evaluation engine for alert expressions
   - State tracking for alert transitions

5. **Tiering and Retention System**
   - Policy-based data lifecycle management
   - Automatic migration between storage tiers
   - Query federation across hot and cold data

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Efficient storage and retrieval of time-series metrics
- Accurate filtering based on multi-dimensional label criteria
- Statistical integrity during downsampling operations
- Correct evaluation of alert expressions
- Proper function of automatic tiering based on policies

### Critical User Scenarios
- Ingestion of high-volume metrics from a large service fleet
- Analysis of performance trends across multiple dimensions
- Detection of anomalies through statistical analysis
- Alerting on critical threshold violations
- Historical analysis spanning hot and cold data tiers

### Performance Benchmarks
- Ingest at least 100,000 metric points per second on reference hardware
- Support at least 10,000 concurrent metric time series in memory
- Complete common filtering queries in under 100ms
- Calculate percentiles over 1M data points in under 500ms
- Evaluate at least 1,000 alert expressions per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Behavior under memory pressure
- Handling of corrupt or invalid metric data
- Recovery from ingestion pipeline failures
- Operation during cold tier unavailability
- Performance with extremely high cardinality label sets

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of alert expression evaluation code
- All error recovery paths must be tested
- Performance tests must cover varying load conditions
- Data integrity tests must verify no loss during tiering

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It efficiently stores metrics with significantly reduced memory footprint
2. Multi-dimensional queries accurately filter metric data with high performance
3. Downsampling preserves statistical characteristics of the original data
4. Alert expressions correctly identify conditions requiring attention
5. Data tiering automatically manages metric lifecycle according to policies

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
5. Run tests with:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

CRITICAL REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a MANDATORY requirement for project completion.
