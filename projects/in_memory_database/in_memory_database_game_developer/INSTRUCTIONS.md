# GameStateDB: In-Memory Database for Game State Persistence

## Overview
GameStateDB is a specialized in-memory database optimized for game development, focusing on rapid save/load operations, complex object relationships, and efficient state management. It provides specialized serialization, spatial indexing, and checkpointing capabilities essential for modern game development across mobile and desktop platforms.

## Persona Description
Yulia creates mobile and desktop games that need to persist player state and game world data. She requires a database solution that minimizes save/load times while supporting complex game object relationships.

## Key Requirements

1. **Optimized Game Object Serialization**
   - Implement a specialized serialization system for complex nested game objects with inheritance hierarchies
   - Critical for Yulia's games which contain numerous interrelated entities with complex inheritance structures and cross-references
   - Must preserve object relationships, handle polymorphism, and support custom serialization hooks for game-specific types

2. **Spatial Indexing**
   - Develop an efficient spatial indexing system for querying game world entities based on location
   - Essential for Yulia's games with large worlds where entities interact based on proximity and position
   - Should support common spatial queries (point, range, nearest neighbor) with configurable dimensions and boundaries

3. **Automatic State Checkpointing**
   - Create an automatic state snapshot system with rapid restore capabilities
   - Vital for Yulia's games that need to implement save points, undo functionality, and crash recovery
   - Must include incremental checkpointing, checkpoint tagging, and efficient diff-based storage

4. **Progressive Loading**
   - Implement strategies for large game worlds with proximity-based prioritization
   - Important for Yulia's open-world games where the entire game state cannot be loaded at once
   - Should include background loading, priority queues based on player position, and prediction algorithms

5. **Memory Footprint Control**
   - Develop configurable compression for different game asset types
   - Critical for Yulia's cross-platform games that run on devices with varying memory constraints
   - Must balance access speed with memory usage and include adaptive policies based on available resources

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Support simulation of game state CRUD operations at scale
- Benchmarking tools for measuring save/load performance
- Memory utilization tracking during various operations
- Spatial query testing frameworks with visualization
- Asset compression ratio and quality assessment

### Performance Expectations
- Save operations complete in under 100ms for typical game states
- Load operations restore critical state in under 200ms
- Spatial queries return results in under 10ms for up to 10,000 entities
- Progressive loading prioritizes visible entities within 16ms (one frame at 60fps)
- Memory compression reduces footprint by at least 50% with minimal CPU overhead

### Integration Points
- Simple API for serializing/deserializing game objects
- Spatial query interface for entity discovery
- Event hooks for state changes and checkpoint creation
- Background loading system with prioritization controls
- Memory management interface for tuning compression settings

### Key Constraints
- Must work within strict frame time budgets (no operations over 16ms on main thread)
- All critical operations must be atomic to prevent corrupted game state
- Serialization format must be backward compatible for save file loading
- Must support cross-platform operation (desktop, mobile, console)
- Low-level operations should be optimizable for target platforms

## Core Functionality

The GameStateDB solution should provide:

1. **Game Object Storage Engine**
   - Schema-flexible storage supporting polymorphic game objects
   - Reference preservation for complex object graphs
   - Custom type handlers for game-specific data types
   - Versioning support for backward compatibility

2. **Spatial Query System**
   - Multi-dimensional spatial index (2D/3D)
   - Range and proximity query optimization
   - Dynamic updates as entities move in the game world
   - Partitioning for large open worlds

3. **Checkpoint Management**
   - Automatic and manual checkpoint triggering
   - Incremental state saving using diffs
   - Rapid state restoration from checkpoints
   - Checkpoint navigation (undo/redo capability)

4. **Progressive Loading Framework**
   - Background loading with priority queues
   - Chunk-based world segmentation
   - Distance-based prioritization from player position
   - Prefetching based on movement prediction

5. **Memory Optimization System**
   - Type-specific compression algorithms
   - Transparent compression/decompression
   - Memory usage monitoring and throttling
   - Adaptive policies based on device capabilities

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate serialization and deserialization of complex game objects
- Correct spatial query results for various entity arrangements
- Reliable checkpoint creation and restoration
- Efficient progressive loading of game world segments
- Effective memory usage reduction through compression

### Critical User Scenarios
- Saving and loading complete game states with complex object relationships
- Querying for entities within interaction range of the player
- Creating and restoring from checkpoints during gameplay
- Entering new areas in a large game world with progressive loading
- Operating on devices with different memory constraints

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure save/load times for game states of various sizes (1MB, 10MB, 100MB)
- Benchmark spatial query performance with different entity counts and distributions
- Test checkpoint creation and restoration speed under various game conditions
- Evaluate loading time for game world segments with different prioritization strategies
- Measure memory usage with different compression settings

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling corrupted save data during loading
- Recovery from interrupted save operations
- Behavior when reaching memory limits
- Performance under extreme entity density in spatial regions
- Graceful degradation when running on minimum-spec hardware

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core serialization components
- All spatial query types must have dedicated test cases
- Performance tests covering typical and worst-case scenarios
- Stress tests for memory management under constrained conditions
- Cross-platform testing verifying consistent behavior

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance Efficiency**
   - Game state saving completes in under 100ms for 95% of test cases
   - Full game state loading initializes critical elements in under 200ms
   - Spatial queries execute in under 10ms even with 10,000+ entities
   - Memory compression reduces footprint by at least 50% for test assets

2. **Gameplay Experience**
   - No frame drops (operations staying under 16ms) during normal gameplay
   - Progressive loading keeps pace with player movement without visible pop-in
   - Checkpoint restoration appears instantaneous to the player
   - Game operates smoothly across target platforms with different memory profiles

3. **Developer Usability**
   - Game entities can be persisted with minimal custom code
   - Spatial queries have intuitive API matching game development patterns
   - Checkpoints and progressive loading require minimal integration effort
