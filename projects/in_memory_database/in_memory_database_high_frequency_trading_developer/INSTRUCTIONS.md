   - Implements adaptive memory policies to maintain system stability under extreme conditions
   - Provides configurable thresholds for graceful degradation instead of catastrophic failure
   - Crucial for maintaining trading system availability during high-volume market events
   - Ensures critical operations remain functional even under resource pressure

5. **Circuit-breaker patterns for preventing cascading failures**
   - Detects and isolates problematic queries or transactions before they impact the entire system
   - Implements automatic fallback mechanisms during peak load periods
   - Provides configurable thresholds for different failure scenarios
