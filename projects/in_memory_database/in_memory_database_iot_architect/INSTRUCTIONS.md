   - Must automatically maintain multiple resolution levels as data arrives
   - Should include policies for pruning/archiving older data based on resolution

2. **Schema evolution for new sensor types**
   - Essential for accommodating new sensors added to the network without downtime
   - Must support automatic schema adaptation when new sensor types are detected
   - Should maintain backward compatibility with existing data and queries
