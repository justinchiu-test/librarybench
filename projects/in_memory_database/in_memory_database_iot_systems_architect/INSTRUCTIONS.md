# EdgeTimeDB: In-Memory Time-Series Database for IoT Systems

## Overview
EdgeTimeDB is a specialized in-memory database optimized for IoT deployments, designed to efficiently store, process, and manage time-series sensor data on edge computing devices. It provides automatic data aggregation, schema flexibility, and bandwidth-aware synchronization features essential for industrial IoT applications with thousands of connected sensors.

## Persona Description
Raj designs systems for industrial IoT deployments with thousands of sensors. He needs a lightweight database that can run on edge computing devices while efficiently handling time-series sensor data.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automatic Data Aggregation**
   - Implement time-series downsampling with configurable resolution levels
   - Critical for Raj's industrial IoT systems that generate massive amounts of sensor data which must be efficiently stored and analyzed at different time granularities
   - Must support various aggregation functions (min, max, avg, sum, count) with automatic roll-up as data ages

2. **Adaptive Schema Evolution**
   - Develop a flexible schema system that can adapt to new sensor types without requiring explicit migration
   - Essential for Raj's continuously evolving IoT deployments where new devices and sensors are frequently added to the system
   - Should handle new fields, data types, and sensor configurations without downtime or data loss

3. **Circular Buffer Storage**
   - Implement a fixed-size historical data retention system with configurable time windows
   - Vital for Raj's edge devices which have limited storage capacity but need to maintain recent historical data for analysis
   - Must include tunable parameters for retention periods by data importance and automatic cleanup

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Create built-in statistical analysis capabilities to identify sensor data outside normal operating parameters
   - Critical for Raj's industrial systems where early detection of sensor anomalies can prevent equipment failure or safety incidents
   - Should include configurable thresholds, statistical methods, and notification mechanisms

5. **Edge-to-Cloud Synchronization**
   - Develop intelligent data transfer mechanisms that optimize bandwidth usage based on network conditions
   - Important for Raj's distributed IoT architecture where edge devices must selectively synchronize the most relevant data to cloud systems
   - Should prioritize critical data, anomalies, and requested time periods while managing limited connectivity
