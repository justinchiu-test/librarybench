# ResilientDB: Event-Sourced In-Memory Database for Microservices

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database designed for microservices architecture that maintains local data consistency during network partitions, implements event sourcing for state reconstruction, and provides configurable consistency models for distributed operations.

## Persona Description
Anika designs distributed systems using microservices architecture. She needs local data storage for services that remains performant during network partitions while eventually synchronizing with other services.

## Key Requirements

1. **Event sourcing capabilities for state reconciliation**
   - Critical for maintaining a complete history of all state transitions
   - Must implement an append-only event log as the source of truth for all data changes
   - Should support replaying events to reconstruct state at any point in time
   - Must include event versioning and migration for schema evolution
   - Should provide utilities for event log compaction while preserving correctness

2. **Configurable consistency models with explicit tradeoffs**
   - Essential for managing the balance between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
   - Must implement multiple consistency models (strong, causal, eventual, etc.)
   - Should provide explicit configuration of consistency-performance tradeoffs per operation
   - Must include monitoring to detect and alert on consistency violations
   - Should offer simulation tools for testing behavior under different consistency settings

3. **Circuit breaker patterns for service failure handling**
   - Vital for maintaining system stability during partial failures
   - Must implement circuit breakers that detect downstream service failures
   - Should support configurable fallback strategies when services are unavailable
   - Must include automatic service health checking and circuit reset
   - Should provide detailed metrics on circuit state transitions and failure rates

4. **Service mesh integration for distributed transactions**
   - Important for coordinating operations across multiple microservices
   - Must provide integration with common service mesh solutions for transaction coordination
   - Should support two-phase commit and saga patterns for distributed transactions
   - Must include recovery mechanisms for interrupted multi-service operations
   - Should offer monitoring interfaces for transaction success/failure rates

5. **Schema registry integration for service compatibility**
   - Critical for ensuring data compatibility across service boundaries
   - Must implement schema versioning and compatibility checking
   - Should provide integration with external schema registry services
   - Must include forward and backward compatibility verification
   - Should offer automatic schema evolution strategies for common changes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be thoroughly testable with pytest
- Tests must verify behavior under various network conditions (partitions, latency, etc.)
- Consistency model tests must validate correct operation across distributed scenarios
- Circuit breaker tests must confirm proper handling of service failures
- Transaction tests must verify data integrity across simulated service boundaries

### Performance Expectations
- Event append operations must complete in under 5ms even under high load
- State reconstruction from events must process at least 10,000 events per second
- Transactions must maintain throughput of at least 1,000 operations per second per node
- Circuit breakers must detect service failures within 100ms
- Schema compatibility checks must add no more than 5ms overhead to operations

### Integration Points
- Must provide Python APIs for integration with microservice frameworks
- Should support standard protocols for service communication (gRPC, REST, etc.)
- Must include adapters for popular service mesh solutions
- Should offer integration with external schema registries
- Must support common messaging systems for event distribution

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - purely APIs and libraries for integration into microservices
- Must operate without external database dependencies - self-contained Python library
- All operations must be designed for resilience to network failures
- Must support both local development and production deployment scenarios

## Core Functionality

The implementation must provide:

1. **Event Sourcing System**
   - Append-only event log for recording all state transitions
   - Event replay mechanism for state reconstruction
   - Versioning and migration support for schema evolution
   - Log compaction utilities for managing storage growth

2. **Consistency Management**
   - Multiple consistency model implementations with clear tradeoffs
   - Per-operation consistency level configuration
   - Consistency monitoring and violation detection
   - Conflict resolution strategies for eventual consistency

3. **Resilience Framework**
   - Circuit breaker implementation for downstream service failure handling
   - Health check mechanisms with automatic circuit reset
   - Fallback strategy configuration for degraded operation
   - Detailed failure and recovery metrics

4. **Distributed Transaction Coordination**
   - Transaction primitives supporting distributed operations
   - Integration with service mesh for coordination
   - Recovery mechanisms for handling partial failures
   - Monitoring and observability for transaction status

5. **Schema Management**
   - Schema versioning and compatibility verification
   - Integration with external schema registries
   - Forward and backward compatibility checking
   - Schema evolution strategies and guidance

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure event append and replay performance under various loads
- Verify transaction throughput with different consistency settings
- Benchmark circuit breaker response time to service failures
- Measure overhead of schema compatibility checking

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Complete network isolation with subsequent reconnection
- Conflicting concurrent operations under eventual consistency
- Cascading service failures affecting multiple dependencies
- Incompatible schema changes between communicating services
- Event log corruption or partial data loss scenarios

### Required Test Coverage
- 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of critical consistency and transaction logic
