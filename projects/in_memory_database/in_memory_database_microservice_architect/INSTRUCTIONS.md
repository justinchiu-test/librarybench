# MicroStateDB: Resilient In-Memory Database for Microservices

## Overview
MicroStateDB is a specialized in-memory database designed for distributed microservice architectures, providing local data persistence that remains performant during network partitions while supporting eventual consistency with other services. It features event sourcing, configurable consistency models, circuit breaker patterns, and service mesh integration essential for modern distributed systems.

## Persona Description
Anika designs distributed systems using microservices architecture. She needs local data storage for services that remains performant during network partitions while eventually synchronizing with other services.

## Key Requirements

1. **Event Sourcing System**
   - Implement a comprehensive event sourcing capability that preserves all state transitions for later reconciliation
   - Critical for Anika's microservices that must maintain complete state history to resolve conflicts after network partitions
   - Must include efficient event storage, replay functionality, and snapshot support for performance optimization

2. **Configurable Consistency Models**
   - Develop adjustable consistency levels with explicit trade-offs between speed and consistency guarantees
   - Essential for Anika's distributed systems where different operations have different consistency requirements
   - Should support linearizable, causal, and eventual consistency with clear semantics and verification mechanisms

3. **Circuit Breaker Patterns**
   - Create intelligent circuit breaker mechanisms for detecting and responding to downstream service failures
   - Vital for Anika's microservice deployments to prevent cascading failures and maintain system stability
   - Must include configurable thresholds, half-open states, and failure tracking across service boundaries

4. **Service Mesh Integration**
   - Implement seamless integration with service mesh technologies for coordinated distributed transactions
   - Important for Anika's architecture to maintain data consistency across service boundaries without tight coupling
   - Should support major service mesh implementations and provide transaction coordination primitives

5. **Schema Registry Integration**
   - Develop compatibility verification with schema registries to ensure interoperability across service boundaries
   - Critical for Anika's evolving microservices which must maintain compatibility despite independent deployment cycles
   - Must include schema validation, versioning, and backward/forward compatibility enforcement

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Support for simulating network partitions and service failures
- Verification tools for consistency model guarantees
- Distributed tracing integration for transaction monitoring
- Benchmarking capabilities for performance under various failure scenarios
- Schema compatibility testing with version evolution

### Performance Expectations
- Local operations complete in under 5ms regardless of network conditions
- Event sourcing overhead adds no more than 20% compared to direct state operations
- Circuit breaker decisions execute in under 1ms
- Recovery and reconciliation after partitions complete within seconds, not minutes
- Schema validation adds less than 5ms to transaction time

### Integration Points
- Service mesh protocols for distributed coordination
- Schema registry APIs for compatibility verification
- Distributed tracing for operation transparency
- Metrics and monitoring for system health
- External event sourcing stores for long-term persistence

### Key Constraints
- Must operate correctly under all network partition scenarios
- All consistency guarantees must be provably correct
- Circuit breaker behavior must be predictable and testable
- Performance degradation under failure must be graceful and bounded
- Memory usage must be controllable even with unbounded event history

## Core Functionality

1. **Event-Sourced Storage Engine**
   - Append-only event log capturing all state transitions
   - Efficient event storage with compression
   - Snapshot mechanisms for performance optimization
   - Replay functionality for reconstruction and recovery

2. **Consistency Management System**
   - Implementation of multiple consistency models
   - Clear semantics for operation guarantees
   - Verification mechanisms for consistency properties
   - Tunable parameters trading consistency for performance

3. **Resilience Framework**
   - Circuit breaker implementation with configurable thresholds
   - Failure detection across service boundaries
   - Graceful degradation during partial outages
   - Recovery strategies after service restoration

4. **Distributed Transaction Coordinator**
   - Service mesh protocol integration
   - Two-phase commit implementation for atomic operations
   - Saga pattern support for long-running transactions
   - Compensation mechanisms for partial failures

5. **Schema Management**
   - Integration with external schema registries
   - Compatibility verification during data operations
   - Version negotiation between services
   - Migration support for evolving schemas

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct event sourcing behavior under normal and failure conditions
- Proper implementation of claimed consistency guarantees
- Accurate circuit breaker operation during service degradation
- Successful coordination of distributed transactions
- Effective schema validation and compatibility enforcement

### Critical User Scenarios
- Microservice operating through complete network isolation
- Recovery and reconciliation after network partition heals
- Gradual degradation as downstream dependencies fail
- Distributed transaction spanning multiple service boundaries
- Schema evolution across multiple service versions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure local operation latency under various network conditions
- Evaluate throughput impact of different consistency levels
- Test recovery time after simulated partitions of varying duration
- Benchmark transaction coordination overhead across services
- Assess schema validation performance with complex schemas

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- System behavior during "split-brain" network partitions
- Recovery from corrupted event logs or inconsistent snapshots
- Operation during partial service mesh failure
- Handling of incompatible schema versions
- Performance under extreme event log growth

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core components
- Explicit tests for each consistency level guarantee
- Chaos testing with simulated network and service failures
- Performance tests under normal and degraded conditions
- Integration tests with actual service mesh implementations

## Success Criteria

1. **Resilience Metrics**
   - Maintains operation during all simulated network partition scenarios
   - Successfully recovers and reconciles state after partitions heal
   - Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures in all test cases
   - System remains partially operational during severe degradation

2. **Consistency Guarantees**
   - All implemented consistency models provably meet their formal guarantees

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Local operations complete in under 5ms for 99th percentile
   - Event sourcing overhead remains under 20% in benchmarks
   - Recovery time proportional to partition duration, within acceptable bounds

   - Simple configuration model for resilience parameters
   - Comprehensive metrics for monitoring system health
   - Transparent debugging for distributed transaction issues
