# FeatureDB: In-Memory Feature Store for Machine Learning

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database designed as a feature store for machine learning operations, providing efficient vector data storage, versioning, transformation, and optimized retrieval for ML inference workloads.

## Persona Description
Wei builds prediction systems that need to quickly access feature data during inference. He requires efficient storage of model features with specialized query patterns for machine learning operations.

## Key Requirements

   - Should support multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine, Manhattan, Hamming, etc.)
   - Must include optimized implementations of vector operations using SIMD where available
   - Should provide indexing structures for accelerating similarity searches (KD-trees, HNSW, etc.)

2. **Feature store functionality with versioning and lineage**
   - Essential for reproducibility and governance in machine learning pipelines
   - Must track feature definitions, transformations, and versions
   - Should maintain lineage information linking features to source data and transformations
   - Must support point-in-time feature retrieval for training/serving consistency

   - Must support standard transformations (normalization, standardization, encoding)
   - Should automatically apply registered transformations during feature retrieval
   - Must preserve transformation parameters for consistency between training and serving
   - Should include monitoring for feature distribution shifts

5. **A/B testing support with randomized selection**
   - Critical for evaluating model changes in production
