# MobileSyncDB: In-Memory Database for Mobile App Backend Synchronization

## Overview
MobileSyncDB is a specialized in-memory database designed specifically for mobile app backend infrastructure, focusing on efficient data synchronization between server and mobile clients with intermittent connectivity. It provides optimized data transfer mechanisms, conflict resolution strategies, and schema flexibility essential for modern mobile application architectures.

## Persona Description
Miguel builds backend services for mobile applications with intermittent connectivity. He needs a database solution that can efficiently synchronize data between server and client-side storage while minimizing transfer size.

## Key Requirements

1. **Differential Sync Protocol**
   - Implement a mechanism that tracks record changes and sends only modified data since the last synchronization
   - This feature is critical for Miguel's work as mobile devices often have limited bandwidth and data plans, requiring minimization of data transfer sizes during synchronization events
   - Must include support for timestamp-based change tracking and client-specific synchronization states

2. **Conflict Resolution Strategies**
   - Develop configurable conflict resolution strategies for handling concurrent modifications made by multiple clients
   - Essential for maintaining data integrity in Miguel's distributed mobile application ecosystem where users may make changes while offline
   - Should support last-write-wins, custom merge functions, and client-priority resolution options

3. **Payload Compression**
   - Implement data type-specific compression algorithms optimized for different kinds of data (text, numeric, binary)
   - Crucial for Miguel's applications that need to minimize data transfer sizes over potentially slow or metered mobile connections
   - Must achieve significant reduction in payload size while maintaining acceptable CPU usage on mobile devices

4. **Automatic Schema Migration**
   - Create a schema versioning system that supports evolving application requirements without breaking client compatibility
   - Vital for Miguel's development workflow as mobile applications frequently update and need to maintain backward compatibility with older app versions still in use
   - Must handle addition/removal of fields and data type changes seamlessly

5. **Battery-Aware Operation Modes**
   - Develop configurable performance profiles that adjust database operations based on device power status
   - Important for Miguel's mobile applications where battery life is a critical user experience factor
   - Should include modes for aggressive caching, reduced polling, and deferred operations when devices are in low-power states

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must support isolated testing without requiring actual mobile devices
- Simulate network conditions including throttling, disconnection, and reconnection
- Support mocking of client-side state for testing synchronization scenarios
- Include tests for measuring compression ratios and performance impact

### Performance Expectations
- Initial synchronization should complete in under 10 seconds for databases up to 10MB
- Incremental synchronization should transfer data proportional only to the changes made
- Compression should reduce payload size by at least 40% for typical mobile app data
- Operations should not increase battery consumption more than 5% above baseline

### Integration Points
- RESTful API for client-server communication with authentication support
- Webhooks for notifying connected clients about data changes
- Export/import interfaces for bulk data operations
- Integration with standard mobile platform libraries

### Key Constraints
- Maximum memory usage must be configurable to prevent excessive resource consumption
- All operations must be resilient to network interruptions
- Compression/decompression CPU overhead must be balanced against bandwidth savings
- Client-side operations must be asynchronous to prevent UI blocking

## Core Functionality

The MobileSyncDB solution should provide:

1. **Server-Side Database Engine**
   - In-memory relational database with table creation, querying, and indexing
   - Change tracking for each record with modification timestamps
   - Client session management to track sync states for each connected device
   - Configurable retention policies for change history

2. **Synchronization Protocol**
   - API endpoints for requesting full and incremental synchronization
   - Batched data transfer with pagination support
   - Checksums for data integrity verification
   - Resume capability for interrupted sync operations

3. **Conflict Management System**
   - Detection of concurrent modifications through version vectors
   - Configurable resolution strategies including automatic and manual
   - Conflict metadata persistence for audit and debugging
   - Notification mechanism for applications to handle complex conflicts

4. **Compression Engine**
   - Data type detection and optimal compression algorithm selection
   - Configurable compression levels trading CPU usage for size reduction
   - Transparent compression/decompression during sync operations
   - Statistics collection for compression effectiveness monitoring

5. **Schema Management**
   - Version-controlled schema definitions
   - Automatic migration generation between schema versions
   - Backward compatibility layer for supporting multiple client versions
   - Schema diff tools for developers to understand changes

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct synchronization of data between server and simulated clients
- Proper handling of concurrent modifications with various conflict resolution strategies
- Effective compression of different data types
- Successful schema migration between versions
- Appropriate adjustment of operation modes based on simulated power conditions

### Critical User Scenarios
- Initial sync of a new client with bulk data transfer
- Incremental sync after small changes to database
- Handling of network interruptions during synchronization
- Resolution of concurrent edits to the same record by different clients
- Migration of client from old schema version to new version

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure sync time for databases of varying sizes (100KB, 1MB, 10MB)
- Compare transfer sizes with and without compression
- Evaluate CPU and memory usage during synchronization operations
- Benchmark performance of query operations under different simulated network conditions
- Test battery consumption simulation under different operation modes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Client attempting sync with extremely outdated state
- Corrupted data during transfer
- Network dropping repeatedly during synchronization
- Schema changes that cannot be automatically migrated
- Extreme cases of many clients modifying the same records concurrently
- Database approaching memory limits during operation

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core synchronization components
- All conflict resolution strategies must have dedicated test cases
- Performance tests must cover all operation modes
- Negative test cases for all error handling paths
- Integration tests simulating realistic mobile app usage patterns

## Success Criteria

1. **Data Transfer Efficiency**
   - Incremental sync transfers are at least 80% smaller than full dataset size
   - Compression reduces payload size by minimum 40% for typical mobile data
   - Synchronization resumption works without duplicating already transferred data

2. **Reliability Metrics**
   - Zero data loss during synchronization interruptions
   - Consistent conflict resolution across all test scenarios
   - Successful recovery from all simulated error conditions

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Initial sync of 10MB database completes in under 10 seconds on standard hardware
   - Incremental syncs complete in under 2 seconds for up to 1000 changed records
   - Schema migrations apply in under 5 seconds regardless of database size

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear API for integration with mobile applications
   - Detailed logging of synchronization operations for debugging
   - Comprehensive documentation of conflict resolution strategies
   - Simple configuration for different deployment environments

To implement this project, use `uv init --lib` to set up the virtual environment and create the `pyproject.toml` file. You can run Python scripts with `uv run python script.py`, install dependencies with `uv sync`, and run tests with `uv run pytest`.
