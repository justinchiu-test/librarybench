# SyncDB: In-Memory Database for Mobile App Synchronization

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database designed for efficient client-server synchronization in mobile applications with intermittent connectivity, focusing on minimizing data transfer size while ensuring data consistency between server and client-side storage.

## Persona Description
Miguel builds backend services for mobile applications with intermittent connectivity. He needs a database solution that can efficiently synchronize data between server and client-side storage while minimizing transfer size.

## Key Requirements

1. **Differential sync protocol sending only changed records**
   - Essential for mobile applications where bandwidth and data usage are constrained
   - Must track changes since the last synchronization point for each client
   - Should support bidirectional synchronization with the client sending local changes to the server
   - Must handle various network conditions and partial sync failures gracefully
   - Change tracking must have minimal performance impact on normal database operations

2. **Conflict resolution strategies for concurrent modifications**
   - Critical when multiple clients modify the same data while offline
   - Must implement configurable strategies (last-write-wins, custom merge functions, etc.)
   - Should preserve all conflicting versions for potential manual resolution when needed
   - Must provide detailed metadata about conflicts (timestamps, originating devices, etc.)
   - Should include built-in strategies for common data types (lists, counters, text)

3. **Payload compression specialized for different data types**
   - Vital for reducing data transfer sizes in mobile environments
   - Must apply optimal compression algorithms based on content type (text, numeric, binary)
   - Should support incremental/delta compression for large text or documents
   - Must include compression ratio metrics and automatic algorithm selection
   - Compression/decompression must be efficient to minimize battery impact on mobile devices

4. **Automatic schema migration support**
   - Mobile apps frequently update their data models with each app version
   - Must support versioned schema definitions with backward compatibility
   - Should automatically apply migrations during synchronization as needed
   - Must handle clients on different schema versions simultaneously
   - Should include utilities for defining and testing migrations

5. **Battery-aware operation modes**
   - Mobile devices prioritize battery life over performance in many scenarios
   - Must implement configurable operation modes with different power/performance tradeoffs
   - Should detect device power status and adjust behavior accordingly
   - Must batch operations to minimize radio activation on mobile devices
   - Should include metrics for power impact of different operation modes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be thoroughly testable with pytest without requiring actual mobile devices
- Tests must verify sync behavior under various network conditions (poor connectivity, intermittent failures)
- Conflict resolution tests must validate correct behavior with complex concurrent modifications
- Schema migration tests must confirm backward and forward compatibility
- Performance and battery impact tests should validate efficiency claims with metrics

### Performance Expectations
- Sync operations must complete in under 1 second for typical data changes (<=100 records)
- Compression should achieve at least 50% size reduction for text data
- Schema migrations must complete in under 500ms for typical schema changes
- Conflict detection and resolution must add no more than 10% overhead to normal operations
- Battery-saving mode should reduce power requirements by at least 30% compared to standard mode

### Integration Points
- Must provide a Python client library for mobile app developers to integrate with
- Should support common SQLite operations for easy integration with mobile platforms
- Must offer webhooks or notification mechanisms for push-based synchronization
- Should provide adapters for common API frameworks (Flask, FastAPI) for server-side integration
- Must include serialization formats compatible with major mobile platforms

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - purely APIs and libraries for integration
- Must function without external database dependencies - self-contained Python library
- All operations must be designed for minimal battery impact on mobile devices
- Must support operation in offline mode with full functionality

## Core Functionality

The implementation must provide:

1. **Data Storage Layer**
   - Efficient in-memory relational storage with schema validation
   - Change tracking mechanism recording modifications since last sync
   - Transaction support ensuring data consistency during sync operations
   - Versioned storage for schema migrations and conflict resolution

2. **Synchronization Engine**
   - Differential sync protocol identifying and transmitting only changed records
   - Bidirectional sync supporting both pull and push operations
   - Conflict detection comparing server and client modification timestamps
   - Resumable sync operations that can continue after network interruptions

3. **Compression System**
   - Type-specific compression algorithms optimized for different data types
   - Compression ratio monitoring and algorithm selection
   - Delta compression for efficiently synchronizing large text changes
   - Configurable compression levels based on network conditions and battery status

4. **Schema Management**
   - Versioned schema definitions supporting evolution over time
   - Migration path definitions for transforming data between schema versions
   - Compatibility checking between client and server schema versions
   - Runtime schema application ensuring clients can always sync regardless of version

5. **Operational Modes**
   - Standard mode optimized for performance and consistency
   - Battery-saving mode reducing power requirements at cost of performance
   - Offline mode for local operations without connectivity
   - Emergency mode prioritizing critical operations during extreme resource constraints

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct synchronization of changes between client and server instances
- Proper conflict detection and resolution according to configured strategies
- Effectiveness of compression for different data types and content
- Successful schema migration across multiple versions
- Appropriate behavior adaptation based on battery status

### Critical User Scenarios
- First-time sync of a new client with complete data download
- Incremental sync after small local and remote changes
- Recovery from interrupted sync operations
- Conflict resolution when multiple clients modify the same data
- App upgrade with schema changes requiring migration

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure data transfer size reduction compared to full synchronization
- Time to complete sync operations under various network conditions
- Compression ratios achieved for different data types
- Schema migration performance for typical version upgrades
- CPU and memory usage in different operational modes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network disconnection during synchronization
- Extreme conflicts with many clients modifying the same data
- Invalid data that doesn't conform to schema requirements
- Backwards compatibility with very old client versions
- Recovery from corrupted client-side database state

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage of conflict resolution and schema migration logic
