# AnalyticDB - Real-Time Analytics Database Engine

## Overview
AnalyticDB is a specialized in-memory database optimized for powering real-time business intelligence dashboards with support for materialized views, time-window caching, progressive query results, multi-tenant isolation, and integration with visual query builders. It enables high-concurrency analytical workloads without sacrificing transactional performance.

## Persona Description
Elena builds interactive dashboards for business intelligence showing live data. She needs to support concurrent analytical queries without impacting transactional performance.

## Key Requirements

1. **Materialized view maintenance with incremental updates**
   - Critical for maintaining pre-computed dashboard queries that refresh automatically
   - Enables near-instant dashboard refreshes even for complex analytical queries
   - Provides incremental update capabilities that only recompute affected portions of views
   - Supports dependency tracking to cascade updates across interconnected views
   - Essential for responsive dashboards that show real-time data without expensive recalculations

2. **Time-window caching strategies for report periods**
   - Optimizes performance for time-based reports on commonly requested intervals (last hour, day, week, month)
   - Implements specialized caching for rolling time windows with efficient updates
   - Provides automatic expiration and refresh policies for different time granularities
   - Supports business calendar aware time windows (business days, quarters, fiscal years)
   - Crucial for consistent performance on time-series analytics common in business dashboards

3. **Progressive query results with approximations**
   - Delivers initial approximate results quickly before exact calculations complete
   - Implements progressive refinement of results with confidence intervals
   - Enables interactive exploration of large datasets without waiting for full query execution
   - Provides cancel/refine options for users to control precision vs. speed tradeoffs
   - Essential for maintaining dashboard responsiveness with large datasets or complex calculations

4. **Multi-tenant isolation for query impact control**
   - Ensures one dashboard's complex queries don't impact performance for other users
   - Implements resource allocation and throttling on a per-tenant basis
   - Provides configurable resource quotas and prioritization mechanisms
   - Tracks and limits resource utilization for individual queries and users
   - Critical for enterprise deployments where multiple departments share the same analytics platform

5. **Visual query builder integration with cost estimation**
   - Provides query cost estimation API for integration with visual builders
   - Enables dashboard designers to understand performance implications before execution
   - Returns detailed cost breakdowns for query components with optimization suggestions
   - Offers alternative query formulations that produce equivalent results more efficiently
   - Essential for helping dashboard creators build responsive, efficient data visualizations

## Technical Requirements
