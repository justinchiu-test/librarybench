# High-Performance In-Memory Database for Trading Systems

## Overview
A specialized in-memory relational database implementation focused on ultra-low latency access to financial market data, supporting complex trading calculations while maintaining strict consistency for trading operations.

## Persona Description
Sarah develops algorithms for a quantitative trading firm where milliseconds matter in market analysis. Her primary goal is to minimize data access latency for real-time financial calculations while maintaining transactional integrity for trading operations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Microsecond-level performance benchmarking tools**
   - Critical for quantitative trading systems where microseconds can determine trade profitability
   - Must include detailed metrics collection for query execution time, broken down by execution phases
   - Should provide historical performance comparisons to detect degradation over time
   - Must have minimal impact on actual database performance when enabled

2. **Specialized numeric data types with precision control**
   - Essential for financial calculations that must maintain exact precision without rounding errors
   - Support for decimal types with configurable precision for different asset classes
   - Operations must preserve precision according to financial calculation standards
   - Must include standard financial functions (VWAP, moving averages, etc.) that respect precision requirements

3. **Time-series optimizations for market data**
   - Trading systems process massive volumes of time-ordered market data requiring specialized storage
   - Implement timestamp-based indexing optimized for range scans and latest-value queries
   - Support data retention policies where older data is automatically compressed or pruned
   - Must maintain performance even with continuous high-frequency inserts during market hours

4. **Memory usage throttling during market volatility**
   - Market volatility can cause unexpected spikes in data volume that could exhaust system resources
   - Implement configurable memory limits with adaptive throttling mechanisms
   - Provide predictive memory usage warnings before critical thresholds are reached
   - Include prioritization mechanisms to ensure critical market data is preserved during memory pressure

5. **Circuit-breaker patterns for system stability**
   - Trading systems must degrade gracefully under extreme load rather than fail completely
   - Implement query circuit breakers that cancel long-running operations exceeding time thresholds
   - Provide automatic detection and prevention of cascading failures during peak load
   - Include self-healing capabilities that can recover from partial system failures without data loss

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be thoroughly testable using pytest without external dependencies
- Performance tests must validate microsecond-level latency guarantees under various load conditions
- Tests must verify correct behavior under simulated market volatility and peak trading periods
- Memory usage tests must confirm throttling mechanisms activate appropriately at defined thresholds
- Circuit breaker tests must validate system stability during simulated failure scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Query latency under 100 microseconds for point lookups under typical load
- Support for at least 100,000 write operations per second for market data ingestion
- Time-series range queries must complete in under 500 microseconds for common window sizes
- Memory usage must remain within configured limits even during 10x normal data volume
- No more than 0.001% of queries may be terminated by circuit breakers under normal conditions

### Integration Points
- Must provide interfaces for seamless integration with popular Python financial libraries (NumPy, pandas)
- Must support ingest from and export to common financial data formats (CSV, FIX, custom binary)
- Should include adapters for time-series visualization tools for monitoring and analysis
- Must provide hooks for custom financial calculation extensions without modifying core code

### Key Constraints
- No external database dependencies - must be fully self-contained Python library
- Must operate entirely in-memory with optional persistence for disaster recovery
- No UI components - purely APIs and libraries for integration into trading systems
- All operations must prioritize consistency and correctness - losing or corrupting trade data is unacceptable

## Core Functionality

The implementation must provide:

1. **Data Storage Layer**
   - Efficient in-memory storage for relational financial data with schema enforcement
   - Specialized storage for time-series market data (ticks, bars, order book updates)
   - Custom numeric types that preserve decimal precision for financial calculations
   - Memory management with configurable limits and throttling capabilities

2. **Query Execution Engine**
   - SQL-like query interface supporting financial calculations and time-series operations
   - High-performance indexing strategies optimized for financial data access patterns
   - Query planner that optimizes execution paths for common financial queries
   - Circuit breaker implementation that cancels operations exceeding time/resource thresholds

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Microsecond-precision benchmarking tools with minimal performance impact
   - Detailed performance metrics for each component of query execution
   - Historical tracking to detect performance regressions over time
   - Real-time alerting when performance falls below configured thresholds

4. **Reliability Mechanisms**
   - Transaction support with ACID guarantees for trading operations
   - Automatic failure detection with circuit breaker implementation
   - Memory pressure handling with configurable throttling policies
   - Recovery mechanisms to maintain system stability during peak load

5. **Financial Extensions**
   - Domain-specific functions for common financial calculations (VWAP, TWAP, etc.)
   - Time-series analysis capabilities (moving averages, momentum indicators)
   - Order book reconstruction and analysis utilities
   - Statistical functions relevant to trading strategies

## Testing Requirements

- Correctness of financial calculations with precision requirements
- Performance meeting latency targets under various load conditions
- Memory throttling activating correctly at configured thresholds
- Circuit breakers preventing cascading failures during overload
- Transaction integrity maintained during simulated market volatility

### Critical User Scenarios

- Measure memory usage under normal and 10x load conditions
- Test transaction throughput for typical trading operations

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extreme market volatility causing 100x normal data volume
- Partial system failures during peak trading periods
- Malformed queries or invalid financial calculations
