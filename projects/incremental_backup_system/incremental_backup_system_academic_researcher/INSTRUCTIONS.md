# ProvenanceBackup - Incremental Backup System for Academic Research

## Overview
ProvenanceBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for academic researchers who generate large experimental datasets and need to preserve both raw data and analysis scripts. The system provides comprehensive provenance tracking, research notebook integration, citation-ready snapshots, collaborative backup policies, and data validation tools to ensure academic integrity and reproducibility of computational research.

## Persona Description
Dr. Rivera conducts computational research generating large datasets from experiments. He needs to preserve both raw data and analysis scripts with proper attribution and provenance tracking for academic integrity and reproducibility.

## Key Requirements

1. **Provenance tracking between data, scripts, and results**
   - Implement a comprehensive provenance tracking system that records and maintains the relationships between input data, analysis scripts, and output results throughout the backup history
   - This feature is essential for academic integrity, allowing researchers to definitively prove the lineage of their results, track how outputs were derived from inputs, and demonstrate the exact code that transformed data, ensuring reproducibility of findings

2. **Research notebook integration**
   - Develop integration with research notebook formats (Jupyter, R Markdown, etc.) that captures the context, parameters, and narrative explanations of experiments alongside the code and data
   - This integration preserves the critical scientific context of experiments, ensuring that future researchers can understand not just what was done but why specific approaches were chosen, preserving the complete intellectual process

3. **Citation-ready backup snapshots**
   - Create a system for generating citable, immutable snapshots of research data and code with persistent identifiers suitable for academic citations in publications
   - These citable snapshots are crucial for the academic publication process, allowing researchers to reference specific versions of datasets and code in papers while providing reviewers and readers with verifiable access to the exact materials used

4. **Collaborative backup policies**
   - Implement secure, role-based backup policies that allow controlled sharing and collaborative access for research team members while maintaining version history and attribution
   - This collaborative functionality supports the reality of modern research teams, enabling multiple researchers to work on the same datasets and code while maintaining clear records of individual contributions and preventing accidental overwrites

5. **Data validation tools**
   - Develop specialized validation tools that verify the integrity and consistency of scientific datasets during backup and restoration processes
   - These validation capabilities are vital for research integrity, ensuring that data remains uncorrupted throughout its lifecycle and that any inadvertent changes or corruption are immediately detected before they can affect research outcomes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Test suites must include sample research datasets of various types (tabular, image, time series, etc.)
- Mock research notebooks must be used to test integration with various notebook formats
- Provenance tracking must be verifiable through graph traversal and dependency validation
- Collaborative scenarios must be tested with simulated multi-user interactions

### Performance Expectations
- Backup of research datasets up to 100GB should complete in under 4 hours
- Provenance graph generation should process at least 1,000 file relationships per minute
- Restoration of specific experiment versions should complete in under 15 minutes
- Citation snapshot generation should complete in under 5 minutes
- The system should handle research datasets with up to 10 million files efficiently

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with common research notebook formats (Jupyter, R Markdown, Observable)
- Should provide plugins for scientific computing environments (Python, R, Julia)
- Must support common scientific file formats and domain-specific data structures
- Should interface with academic repositories and citation systems (DOI, ORCID)

### Key Constraints
- The solution must maintain cryptographic verification of data integrity
- All provenance relationships must be immutable once established
- The system must preserve exact computational environments for reproducibility
- Storage format must be non-proprietary and accessible with standard tools
- Citation mechanisms must comply with academic publishing standards

## Core Functionality

The ProvenanceBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **Research Data Versioning System**
   - Specialized handling for large scientific datasets
   - Efficient storage of different data types (tabular, matrix, image, sequence)
   - Delta encoding optimized for common scientific data formats

2. **Provenance Graph Manager**
   - Tracking and recording of all relationships between files
   - Dependency management for inputs, scripts, and outputs
   - Visualization and query capabilities for provenance relationships

3. **Notebook Integration Framework**
   - Parsers and processors for research notebook formats
   - Context extraction from narrative and computational cells
   - Version control specifically designed for notebook structures

4. **Citation and Publication Engine**
   - Generation of immutable research snapshots
   - Assignment of persistent identifiers for citation
   - Export formats suitable for academic publishing requirements

5. **Collaborative Access Control**
   - Multi-user permission model appropriate for research teams
   - Contribution tracking and attribution mechanisms
   - Conflict resolution for collaborative editing scenarios

6. **Scientific Data Validation**
   - Format-specific validators for different types of research data
   - Consistency checking between related data files
   - Statistical outlier detection for potential data corruption

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify accurate tracking of provenance relationships across multiple generations of analysis
- Confirm proper integration with various research notebook formats
- Test citation snapshot generation and persistence
- Validate collaborative access controls and contribution tracking
- Verify data integrity validation for various scientific file formats

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete research project backup with code, data, and notebooks
- Reproduction of previously published experimental results
- Collaborative analysis with multiple researchers modifying the same dataset
- Creating and publishing citable snapshots for journal submission
- Audit trail generation for research integrity verification

### Performance Benchmarks
- Provenance tracking overhead should not exceed 5% of total backup time
- Backup operations should process at least 100GB of scientific data per hour
- Restoration of specific experiment versions should take less than 10 minutes
- The system should support at least 20 concurrent researchers collaborating
- Citation snapshot generation should complete in under 3 minutes for datasets up to 50GB

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle circular dependencies in analysis workflows
- Proper handling of very large individual files (100GB+) common in some scientific domains
- Correct operation with heterogeneous file formats within the same research project
- Graceful handling of corrupted or partially available research data
- Recovery from interrupted collaborative editing sessions

### Required Test Coverage
- All provenance tracking functions must have 100% test coverage
- Tests must include all supported scientific data formats
- Collaborative scenarios must test all possible permission combinations
- Citation and publication workflows must be fully verified
- All data validation methods must be tested with both valid and corrupted datasets
