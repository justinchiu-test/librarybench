# ComplianceGuard - Regulatory-Compliant Backup System for Financial Services

## Overview
ComplianceGuard is a specialized incremental backup system designed for accounting firms and financial services businesses that must maintain secure, auditable, and regulation-compliant backups of client financial data. The system provides tamper-evident storage, granular retention policies, simplified operations for non-technical staff, and comprehensive compliance reporting.

## Persona Description
Priya runs a small accounting firm and must maintain secure, compliant backups of client financial data. She needs a system that ensures regulatory compliance while being simple enough for non-technical staff to verify backups are working properly.

## Key Requirements

1. **Compliance-Oriented Retention Policies**
   - Implement configurable retention rules based on document types and financial regulations
   - Support different retention schedules for tax returns, financial statements, client correspondence, and working papers
   - Create automated enforcement of minimum and maximum retention periods based on jurisdiction
   - Enable legal hold capabilities that override normal retention policies
   - This feature is critical for Priya as it ensures her firm meets the varying regulatory requirements for different types of financial documents, protecting the firm from compliance violations

2. **Tamper-Evident Backups with Verification**
   - Develop cryptographic verification for all backed-up files
   - Implement digital signatures and checksums to detect unauthorized modifications
   - Create verification certificates with timestamps for audit purposes
   - Support for third-party verification of backup integrity
   - This requirement is essential because Priya needs to prove to regulators and clients that financial records remain unchanged and authentic, providing evidence that records haven't been altered since backup

3. **Simplified Restoration Interface for Non-Technical Users**
   - Design programmer-friendly APIs for building intuitive restoration tools
   - Implement powerful search capabilities by client, date range, document type, and content
   - Create clear file preview and verification mechanisms
   - Support batch restoration operations with comprehensive logging
   - This feature ensures that all staff members, regardless of technical expertise, can reliably retrieve client records when needed, reducing dependence on IT specialists

4. **Role-Based Access Controls**
   - Develop a comprehensive permission system for backup and restoration operations
   - Support different access levels for administrators, accountants, and support staff
   - Implement detailed audit logging of all access attempts and actions
   - Enable temporary access grants with automatic expiration
   - Access controls are vital to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive client financial information, maintaining client confidentiality and regulatory compliance

5. **Automated Compliance Reports**
   - Create comprehensive reporting on backup status, integrity, and retention compliance
   - Implement scheduled report generation for different regulatory frameworks
   - Develop exception reporting for backup failures or policy violations
   - Support export in formats suitable for regulatory submissions
   - These reports provide Priya with documentation to demonstrate compliance during audits and give her visibility into the backup system's operation without requiring technical knowledge

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All compliance rules must be verifiable through automated test suites
- Access control mechanisms must be thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities
- Reporting functionality must be verifiable with predetermined datasets
- Tamper detection must be proven effective against various modification scenarios
- Restoration accuracy must be validated across all supported file types

### Performance Expectations
- Backup operations must complete within defined maintenance windows
- Verification of backup integrity must be performable within 4 hours for 7 years of records
- Search and retrieval operations must return results in under 5 seconds
- Report generation should complete in under 10 minutes for full compliance reports
- System must efficiently handle at least 100GB of financial records with full versioning

### Integration Points
- Financial software data formats (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.)
- Document management systems via standard APIs
- Secure storage mechanisms including local and compliant cloud options
- Timestamp authorities for independent verification
- Reporting tools for compliance documentation

### Key Constraints
- Must comply with financial industry regulations (SOX, GDPR, GLBA, etc.)
- All operations must maintain chain of custody for legal purposes
- Storage must be encrypted both at rest and in transit
- System must function within strict security boundaries
- Backup and verification processes must not interfere with normal business operations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Compliance Engine**
   - Document classification and categorization
   - Retention policy definition and enforcement
   - Regulatory framework implementation
   - Jurisdictional rules management

2. **Tamper-Evidence System**
   - Cryptographic signature generation and verification
   - Hash chain implementation for backup history
   - Timestamp integration with secure sources
   - Verification certificate generation

3. **Access Control Framework**
   - User and role management
   - Permission definition and enforcement
   - Detailed activity logging
   - Authentication integration

4. **Search and Restoration**
   - Metadata and full-text indexing
   - Query processing and optimization
   - Preview generation for common financial document formats
   - Batch operation handling

5. **Compliance Reporting**
   - Status monitoring and aggregation
   - Exception detection and alerting
   - Report template management
   - Automated schedule execution

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct application of retention policies for different document types
- Effectiveness of tamper detection for various modification scenarios
- Proper enforcement of access controls based on user roles
- Accuracy and performance of search and restoration operations
- Completeness and correctness of compliance reports

### Critical User Scenarios
- End-of-year archiving of client tax returns with appropriate retention policies
- Regulatory audit requiring verification of record integrity
- Staff member searching for and restoring specific client documents
- Administrator configuring access permissions for new team members
- Generating compliance reports for board review or regulatory submission

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process daily incremental backup of 5GB of new financial documents in under 1 hour
- Complete integrity verification of 1TB archive within 8 hours
- Return search results across 7 years of client records in under 3 seconds
- Generate comprehensive compliance report in under 5 minutes
- Support at least 25 concurrent users performing search and restoration operations

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Attempted tampering with backed-up financial records
- Conflicting retention policies between jurisdictions
- Recovery from infrastructure failure during backup operations
- Handling of corrupt or partially damaged backup files
- Unauthorized access attempts and security breach scenarios

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of compliance rule implementation
- 100% coverage of access control mechanisms
- 95% coverage of search and restoration functionality
- 100% coverage of tamper detection capabilities
- 90% coverage of reporting components

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The system correctly applies appropriate retention policies to different types of financial documents based on regulatory requirements
2. Tamper-evident features reliably detect any unauthorized modifications to backed-up files and provide verification certificates suitable for audit purposes
