# ComplianceBackup - Incremental Backup System for Small Business Financial Data

## Overview
ComplianceBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for small accounting firms and businesses that must maintain secure, compliant backups of financial data. The system enforces regulatory compliance, provides tamper-evident verification, offers simplified restoration for non-technical users, implements role-based access controls, and generates automated compliance reports to ensure proper data management and retention.

## Persona Description
Priya runs a small accounting firm and must maintain secure, compliant backups of client financial data. She needs a system that ensures regulatory compliance while being simple enough for non-technical staff to verify backups are working properly.

## Key Requirements

1. **Compliance-oriented retention policies**
   - Implement configurable retention policies that automatically enforce different regulatory requirements for various document types (tax returns, financial statements, engagement letters, etc.)
   - This feature is critical for accounting firms that must adhere to complex, jurisdiction-specific retention rules varying from 3-10+ years depending on document type, ensuring legal compliance while automating the complex task of tracking retention periods

2. **Tamper-evident backups with verification certificates**
   - Develop a cryptographic verification system that generates tamper-evident backups and digital verification certificates for each backup set, suitable for audit purposes
   - This security measure is essential for proving to regulators and clients that financial data has remained unchanged since backup, providing cryptographic proof that records haven't been altered retroactively

3. **Simplified restoration interface for non-technical users**
   - Create an API that enables simple, intuitive search and preview of backed-up documents, designed specifically for non-technical accounting staff who need to locate and restore files
   - This user-friendly approach ensures that all staff members can independently recover needed documents without IT assistance, supporting business continuity even when technical staff aren't available

4. **Role-based access controls**
   - Implement a comprehensive permissions system that enforces role-based access controls for backup administration and restoration privileges across the organization
   - These granular permissions are crucial for maintaining the principle of least privilege in financial environments, ensuring staff can only access or restore data appropriate to their role and responsibilities

5. **Automated compliance reports**
   - Develop a reporting engine that automatically generates detailed compliance documentation of backup status, retention adherence, and verification status suitable for audit purposes
   - These automated reports are vital for demonstrating due diligence during regulatory audits or client inquiries, providing comprehensive evidence that data protection obligations are being fulfilled

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 95% code coverage
- Compliance-critical functions must have 100% test coverage
- Test suites must include simulation of regulatory audits and compliance verification
- Role-based access controls must be verified with authorization test matrices
- Mock auditors must be used to validate reporting functionality against regulatory requirements

### Performance Expectations
- Daily incremental backups of up to 10GB of financial data should complete in under 30 minutes
- Report generation should complete in under 1 minute for standard compliance reports
- Verification of backup integrity should process at least 1GB per minute
- Search and restoration operations should return results in under 5 seconds for typical queries
- The system should handle at least 100 concurrent user sessions without performance degradation

### Integration Points
- Must interface with standard financial document formats and accounting software
- Must provide secure API endpoints for integration with practice management systems
- Should support export of compliance reports in formats suitable for regulators (PDF, CSV)
- Must integrate with standard authentication systems for role-based access controls

### Key Constraints
- All operations must be logged with immutable audit trails
- The solution must comply with relevant financial regulations (SOX, GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted to financial industry standards
- Backup verification must be mathematically provable using cryptographic methods
- The system must not allow unauthorized bypass of retention policies, even for administrators

## Core Functionality

The ComplianceBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **Document Classification System**
   - Intelligent categorization of financial documents based on content and metadata
   - Configuration framework for defining document types and their retention requirements
   - Validation mechanisms to ensure proper classification

2. **Compliance Policy Engine**
   - Rule-based system for defining and enforcing retention policies
   - Jurisdictional framework for managing different regulatory requirements
   - Policy verification and conflict resolution

3. **Cryptographic Verification System**
   - Secure hashing and signing of backup sets
   - Certificate generation and management for backup verification
   - Tamper detection and alerting mechanisms

4. **Access Control Framework**
   - Role definition and permission management system
   - Authentication and authorization for all backup operations
   - Audit logging of all access and restoration attempts

5. **Restoration Service Layer**
   - Search and indexing for efficient document location
   - Preview capabilities for various document types
   - Controlled restoration workflow with appropriate approvals

6. **Compliance Reporting Engine**
   - Automated generation of regulatory compliance reports
   - Evidence collection for audit purposes
   - Configurable reporting templates for different requirements

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify correct application of retention policies for various document types
- Confirm tamper detection for modified backup contents
- Test search and restoration functionality with various document types and user roles
- Validate role-based access control enforcement for different operations
- Verify accuracy and completeness of generated compliance reports

### Critical User Scenarios
- Preparation for regulatory audit with comprehensive compliance reports
- Recovery of specific client documents by accounting staff
- Security breach simulation and tamper detection
- Routine verification of backup integrity and compliance
- Multi-jurisdiction client handling with different retention requirements

### Performance Benchmarks
- Backup operations must complete within scheduled maintenance windows (typically 6 hours)
- Verification certificate generation must take less than 10 seconds per backup set
- Search operations must return results in under 3 seconds for 95% of queries
- Report generation must complete in under 2 minutes for annual compliance summaries
- System must support at least 50 simultaneous users during peak tax season

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle conflicting retention requirements gracefully
- Proper handling of corrupted backup data with clear notifications
- Correct operation during permission changes and role transitions
- Graceful handling of storage space limitations with prioritized retention
- Recovery from interrupted backup operations without compliance violations

### Required Test Coverage
- 100% code coverage for all compliance-critical components
- All administrator and user roles must be tested with complete permission matrices
- All supported document types must be verified for proper retention handling
- Error recovery scenarios must be tested for all critical operations
- Performance tests must simulate peak usage during tax season and audit periods

## Success Criteria
