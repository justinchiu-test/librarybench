# InfraGuard - Environment-Aware Backup System for Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
InfraGuard is a specialized incremental backup system designed for DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure as code. It provides environment-aware backups, understands relationships between configuration files, securely handles sensitive information, supports automated recovery testing, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines to capture known-good configurations.

## Persona Description
Alex manages infrastructure as code for a medium-sized SaaS company. They need to back up configuration files, deployment scripts, and infrastructure state while maintaining consistency between related components.

## Key Requirements

1. **Environment-Aware Backup System**
   - Implement intelligent parsing of configuration files to understand relationships
   - Create dependency graphs between related infrastructure components
   - Support for detecting configuration inconsistencies across related files
   - Enable environment-specific backup policies (dev, staging, production)
   - This feature is critical for Alex because it ensures that backups maintain the relationships between interdependent configuration files, preventing partial or inconsistent restoration that could break infrastructure

2. **State File Handling for Infrastructure Tools**
   - Develop specialized handling for state files from infrastructure tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
   - Implement version control compatible with tool-specific state formats
   - Create state file locking and conflict prevention mechanisms
   - Support comparison and differential analysis of state changes
   - This feature is essential because it properly manages the critical state files that represent the actual deployed infrastructure, allowing reliable restoration of environments to known states

3. **Secret Detection and Secure Handling**
   - Create pattern matching for identifying credentials in configuration files
   - Implement secure storage for detected secrets
   - Support integration with external secret management systems
   - Enable policy-based handling of secrets during backup and restoration
   - Secure handling of credentials is vital as it prevents accidentally exposing sensitive information in backups while still maintaining the ability to restore complete and functional configurations

4. **Disaster Recovery Testing**
   - Design automated verification of restored configurations
   - Implement sandbox environments for testing recovered configurations
   - Create validation rules for testing infrastructure functionality
   - Support scheduled recovery tests with reporting
   - This testing capability ensures that Alex can verify backups are actually usable for recovery, not just complete, providing confidence that systems can be restored in a real emergency

5. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Develop hooks for capturing configurations after successful deployments
   - Implement tagging of "known-good" configuration states
   - Create rollback capabilities to specific pipeline-verified states
   - Support correlation between deployment artifacts and configuration backups
   - This integration ensures that the backup system captures known-working configurations after successful deployments, providing reliable recovery points that are known to function correctly

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All environment-awareness logic must be testable with sample configuration sets
- State file handling must be verifiable with tool-specific test fixtures
- Secret detection must be validated against common credential patterns
- Recovery testing must be automatable without manual intervention
- CI/CD integration must be testable with simulated pipeline events

### Performance Expectations
- Configuration analysis should complete in under 30 seconds for typical deployments
- State file operations should add minimal overhead to regular tool operations
- Secret scanning should process 10MB of configuration in under 5 seconds
- Recovery testing should provide actionable results within 10 minutes
- System should handle configuration sets for 500+ infrastructure components

### Integration Points
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, etc.)
- CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, etc.)
- Cloud provider APIs for verification
- Monitoring systems for recovery testing validation

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain exact fidelity of state files without corruption
- All operations must be non-intrusive to existing infrastructure
- Secret handling must comply with security best practices
- Recovery testing must not impact production systems
- System must support multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructure

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Configuration Analysis Engine**
   - Parser modules for common configuration formats
   - Relationship detection and mapping
   - Dependency graph construction
   - Consistency checking algorithms

2. **State Management**
   - Tool-specific state file handlers
   - State version control
   - Differential analysis
   - Locking and conflict prevention

3. **Security Framework**
   - Pattern-based secret detection
   - Secure storage implementation
   - External vault integration
   - Policy enforcement

4. **Recovery Validation**
   - Automated recovery environment provisioning
   - Verification test execution
   - Result analysis and reporting
   - Failure diagnosis

5. **CI/CD Connector**
   - Pipeline event handling
   - Known-good state tagging
   - Deployment artifact correlation
   - Rollback capability

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate detection of relationships between configuration files
- Proper handling of infrastructure tool state files
- Effective identification and secure handling of secrets
- Reliable execution of recovery testing
- Successful integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Critical User Scenarios
- Infrastructure update with changes across multiple related components
- State file corruption requiring restoration from backup
- Configuration containing secrets requiring secure handling
- Disaster recovery drill with full environment restoration
- Post-deployment capture of known-good configuration

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process and analyze 1000 configuration files in under 2 minutes
- Handle state files up to 100MB with minimal performance impact
- Scan 100MB of configuration for secrets in under 30 seconds
- Complete recovery test cycle within 15 minutes
- Backup capture after CI/CD deployment in under 5 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Partial or corrupted state files
- Circular dependencies in configurations
- Encrypted secrets in unexpected formats
- Failed recovery tests with unclear causes
- Concurrent modifications to infrastructure during backup

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for configuration analysis components
- 100% coverage for state file handling
- 100% coverage for secret detection and handling
- 90% coverage for recovery testing
- 95% coverage for CI/CD integration

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The system correctly identifies and maintains relationships between interdependent configuration files
2. State files from infrastructure tools are properly versioned and can be restored without corruption
3. Sensitive information is automatically detected and securely handled according to policies
4. Recovery tests successfully verify that backed-up configurations can be properly restored
5. CI/CD pipeline integration captures known-good configurations after successful deployments
6. All backed-up configurations can be restored with their complete context and relationships
7. The system provides clear visibility into the backup status of critical infrastructure components
8. Recovery operations consistently result in fully functional infrastructure
9. The system meets performance benchmarks while handling enterprise-scale configuration sets
