# InfraBackup - Incremental Backup System for Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
InfraBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure as code. The system provides environment-aware backups that understand relationships between configuration files, specialized handling for infrastructure state files, secret detection and secure handling, automated disaster recovery testing, and integration with CI/CD pipelines for capturing known-good configurations.

## Persona Description
Alex manages infrastructure as code for a medium-sized SaaS company. They need to back up configuration files, deployment scripts, and infrastructure state while maintaining consistency between related components.

## Key Requirements

1. **Environment-aware backups for configuration relationships**
   - Implement an intelligent backup system that understands the relationships and dependencies between configuration files across different environments (development, staging, production)
   - This feature is critical for DevOps engineers as it ensures that interdependent configurations are backed up consistently, preventing partial or inconsistent recoveries that could lead to system failures or security issues

2. **State file handling for infrastructure as code tools**
   - Develop specialized handling for infrastructure state files from tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, and other IaC platforms, including proper versioning and consistency protection
   - This capability is essential because state files represent the actual deployed infrastructure and must be carefully preserved with their corresponding code to enable reliable infrastructure recovery without orphaned or unmanaged resources

3. **Secret detection and secure handling**
   - Create a system that automatically detects secrets and credentials in configuration files, properly secures them during backup, and manages their restoration safely
   - This security feature prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials in backups while ensuring they can be securely restored when needed, addressing a critical security concern in infrastructure management

4. **Disaster recovery testing with automated verification**
   - Implement automated disaster recovery testing that can restore configurations to isolated environments and verify their correctness through functional testing
   - This testing capability is vital for ensuring that backups can actually be used to recover infrastructure in an emergency, providing confidence that disaster recovery plans will work when needed

5. **CI/CD pipeline integration**
   - Develop integration with CI/CD systems to automatically capture known-good configurations after successful deployments, creating reliable restoration points
   - This integration with development workflows ensures that only verified, functioning configurations are marked as reliable backup points, streamlining recovery to known-working states

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must verify correct handling of various infrastructure tools and formats
- Security tests must confirm proper handling of detected secrets and credentials
- Recovery testing must validate the functionality of restored configurations
- CI/CD integration must be verified with mock pipeline scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Initial backup of a complete infrastructure codebase should complete in under 10 minutes
- Incremental backups should process changes in under 2 minutes after deployments
- Secret detection should add no more than 15% overhead to backup operations
- Configuration relationship analysis should complete in under 3 minutes for large environments
- Disaster recovery testing should provision and verify test environments in under 30 minutes

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with major infrastructure as code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, etc.)
- Should provide hooks into common CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Must interface with secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, etc.)
- Should support integration with configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.)

### Key Constraints
- The solution must never store secrets unencrypted, even temporarily
- All operations must be fully auditable with detailed logs
- The system must not interfere with active infrastructure deployments
- Recovery operations must be atomic to prevent partial application of configurations
- The implementation must work in air-gapped environments where needed

## Core Functionality

The InfraBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **Configuration Relationship Analyzer**
   - Parsing and analysis of configuration files across various formats
   - Dependency mapping between related configuration components
   - Environment differentiation and relationship tracking

2. **Infrastructure State Manager**
   - Specialized handling for state files from various IaC tools
   - Version control optimized for infrastructure state history
   - Consistency verification between code and state

3. **Secrets Handling Engine**
   - Detection of secrets and credentials in configuration files
   - Secure encryption and storage of sensitive information
   - Safe restoration process for protected secrets

4. **Disaster Recovery Testing Framework**
   - Automated environment provisioning for recovery testing
   - Functional verification of restored configurations
   - Reporting and validation of recovery success

5. **CI/CD Integration Service**
   - Hooks and plugins for various CI/CD platforms
   - Event-based backup triggering after successful deployments
   - Known-good state marking and metadata

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify correct identification of relationships between configuration files
- Confirm proper handling of state files from various infrastructure tools
- Test detection and secure handling of secrets and credentials
- Validate disaster recovery testing in isolated environments
- Verify integration with CI/CD pipelines for capturing known-good states

### Critical User Scenarios
- Full infrastructure recovery after catastrophic failure
- Selective restoration of specific services while maintaining dependencies
- Secret rotation and update across multiple environments
- Migration of infrastructure between cloud providers
- Forensic analysis of configuration changes after security incidents

### Performance Benchmarks
- Configuration relationship analysis must process at least 1,000 files per minute
- Secret detection must scan at least 10MB of configuration data per second
- Disaster recovery testing must provision test environments in under 15 minutes
- CI/CD integration must add no more than 30 seconds to successful pipeline runs
- Full infrastructure restoration must complete within defined recovery time objectives (typically 1-4 hours)

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle circular dependencies in configurations
- Proper handling of malformed or invalid configuration files
- Correct operation with partial or incomplete information
- Graceful handling of failed disaster recovery tests
- Recovery from interrupted backup or restoration processes

### Required Test Coverage
- All secret handling code must have 100% test coverage
- Tests must include all supported infrastructure as code tools
- Disaster recovery testing must be verified for each supported environment type
