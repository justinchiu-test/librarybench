# ConfigVault - Incremental Backup System for Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
A specialized incremental backup system designed for DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure as code. The system enables tracking of configuration files, deployment scripts, and infrastructure state while ensuring consistency between related components and providing secure handling of sensitive credentials in backup sets.

## Persona Description
Alex manages infrastructure as code for a medium-sized SaaS company. They need to back up configuration files, deployment scripts, and infrastructure state while maintaining consistency between related components.

## Key Requirements
1. **Environment-aware Backup System**: Implement an intelligent system that understands relationships between configuration files across different environments (development, staging, production). This feature ensures that Alex can back up and restore configuration sets that maintain consistency across related components, preventing the partial update problems that can occur when configuration files have interdependencies.

2. **State File Management**: Create specialized handling for infrastructure as code state files (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.) that preserves both the state and the code that generated it while tracking correlations between them. This capability allows Alex to restore not just infrastructure definitions but also their deployed state, providing complete recovery capabilities for cloud resources.

3. **Secret Detection and Secure Handling**: Develop advanced pattern recognition that identifies credentials, keys, and other sensitive information in configuration files with secure vault integration for proper storage. This ensures that sensitive information is never stored in plaintext within backups while still allowing authorized restoration of complete configurations.

4. **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Implement functionality for automated verification of restored configurations to validate that they will function correctly if deployed. This feature enables Alex to proactively test backup integrity and restoration procedures, ensuring that backups will actually work when needed during critical recovery scenarios.

5. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Create seamless integration with continuous integration systems to automatically capture known-good configurations after successful deployments. This capability allows backup points to be automatically created at verified stable states, ensuring that Alex always has recoverable configurations that are known to work properly.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have isolated unit tests with dependency injection for external systems
- Environment relationship tracking must be testable with simulated configuration sets
- State file handling must be tested with various IaC tool outputs and versions
- Secret detection must be verifiable with diverse credential patterns and formats
- Recovery testing must validate against actual deployment checkpoints
- CI/CD integration must be testable without requiring actual pipeline execution

### Performance Expectations
- The system must efficiently handle configuration repositories with 100,000+ files
- Relationship analysis must complete in under 30 seconds for complex environment sets
- State file processing must handle files up to 100MB with delta compression
- Secret scanning must process at least 10MB of configuration text per second
- Recovery testing simulations must complete within 5 minutes per environment
- CI/CD integration must add less than 10 seconds to successful pipeline completion

### Integration Points
- Version control systems (Git, SVN)
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi, etc.)
- Secret management vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Cloud provider APIs for state verification

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms
- All operations must be automatable for integration into existing workflows
- The system must accommodate both plaintext configurations and binary state files
- Storage formats must be independent of specific IaC tools or cloud providers
- Secret handling must comply with common security standards (SOC2, ISO27001)
- System must operate efficiently in both cloud and on-premises environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Incremental Backup Engine**: A core module handling configuration file change detection, efficient delta storage, and versioned backup creation with infrastructure state preservation.

2. **Environment Relationship Analyzer**: Intelligence for identifying and preserving connections between related configuration elements across different environments and deployment targets.

3. **IaC State Manager**: Specialized components for handling the unique requirements of infrastructure state files, including parsing, delta compression, and correlation with defining code.

4. **Secrets Scanner and Vault**: Advanced pattern detection for identifying sensitive information with secure handling through encryption and integration with external secret management systems.

5. **Deployment Validator**: Functionality for simulating deployment of restored configurations to verify recoverability and consistency without affecting production environments.

6. **CI/CD Connector Framework**: Integration adapters for capturing configuration states from continuous integration pipelines at verified checkpoints of successful deployment.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by various DevOps tools (though implementing a UI is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Environment relationship tracking with accurate dependency mapping
- State file delta storage with proper version correlation
- Secret detection and secure storage with appropriate access controls
- Recovery testing with validation of configuration consistency
- CI/CD integration with proper capture of successful deployments
- Incremental backup efficiency for large configuration repositories

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete infrastructure migration between cloud providers
- Recovery from failed deployment with automatic rollback to last known good state
- Secure restoration of configurations including sensitive credentials
- Cross-environment consistency verification before deployment
- Audit trail generation for compliance and security reviews
- Quick comparison between environment configurations to identify drift

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial backup of a 50,000-file repository completing in under 10 minutes
- Incremental backup completing in under 5 minutes for daily configuration changes
- Relationship analysis processing complex environments at 1000 files per minute
- Secret scanning with 99.9% detection rate and less than 0.1% false positives
- Recovery testing completing full validation cycles in under 10 minutes per environment
- Storage efficiency achieving at least 80% reduction for configuration history through deduplication

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of partial infrastructure deployments with incomplete state
- Recovery from corrupted state files with minimal data loss
- Proper functioning with extremely large infrastructure states (thousands of resources)
- Correct behavior with circular dependencies between configuration components
- Appropriate handling of third-party modules and external dependencies
- Graceful operation during rapid configuration changes (GitOps workflows)

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Integration tests must verify all external system interfaces

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system demonstrates proper environment relationship tracking with consistency maintenance.
3. Infrastructure state files are properly managed with their defining code.
4. Sensitive information is securely handled throughout the backup lifecycle.
5. Recovery testing correctly validates restored configuration consistency.
6. CI/CD integration properly captures configurations at successful deployment checkpoints.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. Code quality meets professional standards with appropriate documentation.

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
