# CreativeBackup - Incremental Backup System for Digital Artists

## Overview
CreativeBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for digital artists working with complex project files and asset libraries. The system provides visual difference comparison between versions, timeline-based browsing with thumbnails, selective element restoration, asset library deduplication, and workspace state preservation to help artists track iterations while efficiently managing large creative assets.

## Persona Description
Sofia creates digital art for animation studios, working with complex project files and reference materials. She needs to track iterations of creative works while maintaining large texture and asset libraries.

## Key Requirements

1. **Visual difference comparison for creative files**
   - Implement a visual comparison system that can show differences between file versions for images, 3D models, and other visual assets, highlighting what has changed between iterations
   - This capability is crucial for artists to visually understand the evolution of their work, identify specific changes between versions, and make informed decisions about which elements to keep, revert, or modify without having to manually open multiple versions

2. **Timeline-based browsing with thumbnail previews**
   - Create an interactive version history system that presents file evolution as a visual timeline with thumbnail previews of each version, allowing artists to see the progression of their work
   - This visual history provides artists with an intuitive way to track creative development, helping them find specific versions based on visual appearance rather than timestamps or technical metadata, aligning with their visual thinking process

3. **Selective restoration of specific elements**
   - Develop a system for extracting and restoring specific elements or layers from previous versions without losing recent changes to other parts of the file
   - This granular restoration capability allows artists to recover specific creative decisions or elements from earlier versions while preserving other recent work, supporting non-linear creative processes and experimentation

4. **Asset library deduplication for creative projects**
   - Implement intelligent deduplication specifically designed for creative asset libraries that understands references and linked files within complex project structures
   - This specialized deduplication is essential for managing the large texture and asset libraries digital artists maintain, significantly reducing storage requirements while preserving all unique creative assets

5. **Workspace state preservation**
   - Create a system that captures application layouts, tool configurations, and other workspace settings along with the creative files, preserving the complete working environment
   - This context preservation ensures artists can restore not just their files but their exact working environment, maintaining productivity by eliminating the need to reconfigure complex software settings with each restoration

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 85% code coverage
- Visual difference algorithms must be tested with various creative file formats and content types
- Timeline generation must be verified for accuracy and performance with long version histories
- Selective restoration must be tested across multiple file formats and complexity levels
- Workspace state capture must be validated across supported creative applications

### Performance Expectations
- Visual difference generation should complete in under 30 seconds for files up to 1GB
- Timeline browsing should load thumbnails in under 2 seconds for projects with 100+ versions
- Selective restoration should extract elements in under 1 minute even from complex files
- Deduplication should reduce storage requirements by at least 40% for typical asset libraries
- Workspace state capture should add no more than 5% overhead to backup operations

### Integration Points
- Must support major creative file formats (PSD, AI, XCF, 3DS, FBX, Blender, etc.)
- Should integrate with common digital art applications via plugin architecture
- Must work with standard file systems and cloud storage platforms
- Should provide a Python API for custom workflow integration

### Key Constraints
- The solution must never modify original creative files during analysis
- Version history must be accessible without the original creative applications
- The system must handle very large files (10GB+) common in 3D and animation work
- Backup and restoration operations must preserve all metadata and color profiles
- The implementation must maintain file fidelity with no quality loss or conversion artifacts

## Core Functionality

The CreativeBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **Creative File Format Analyzer**
   - Parsing and interpretation of various creative file formats
   - Layer and element extraction for complex file types
   - Metadata and attribute preservation during backup

2. **Visual Difference Engine**
   - Image and model comparison algorithms for creative assets
   - Visual highlighting of changed elements and regions
   - Output generation in formats suitable for artist review

3. **Visual Timeline Generator**
   - Thumbnail creation for various file types and versions
   - Interactive timeline data structure and organization
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of preview assets

4. **Selective Restoration Framework**
   - Element isolation and extraction from previous versions
   - Intelligent merging of restored elements with current files
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping modifications

5. **Asset Library Manager**
   - Reference detection and tracking in creative projects
   - Specialized deduplication for textures and other assets
   - Link maintenance and repair during restoration

6. **Workspace Capture System**
   - Application configuration and layout preservation
   - Tool and preference settings capture
   - Environment restoration for creative applications

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify accurate visual difference detection between file versions
- Confirm proper timeline generation with appropriate thumbnails
- Test selective element restoration across various file complexities
- Validate asset deduplication with reference preservation
- Verify workspace state capture and restoration for supported applications

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complex animation project with character iterations and shared assets
- Multi-layer digital painting with numerous revision history
- 3D model development with texture and material variations
- Cross-application workflow involving multiple creative tools
- Collaborative project with multiple artists contributing to shared files

### Performance Benchmarks
- Visual difference comparison must process at least 100MB per minute
- Timeline generation must support projects with 500+ versions
- Selective restoration must successfully extract elements from 95% of test cases
- Deduplication must achieve at least 40% storage reduction for standard test assets
- The system must handle at least 10TB of creative assets efficiently

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle proprietary and uncommon file formats gracefully
- Proper handling of corrupted files without affecting the backup process
- Correct operation with unusual layer structures and naming
- Graceful handling of files larger than available memory
- Recovery from interrupted operations without data loss
