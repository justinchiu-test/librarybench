# ArtisticVault - Visual Asset Backup System for Digital Artists

## Overview
ArtisticVault is a specialized incremental backup system designed for digital artists creating content for animation studios. It provides visual differencing tools, timeline-based browsing, selective restoration capabilities, efficient asset library management, and workspace state preservation to maintain the complex creative workflow of digital art production.

## Persona Description
Sofia creates digital art for animation studios, working with complex project files and reference materials. She needs to track iterations of creative works while maintaining large texture and asset libraries.

## Key Requirements

1. **Visual Difference Comparison**
   - Implement visual comparison tools for images and 3D model versions
   - Create side-by-side and overlay comparison modes
   - Generate visual heatmaps highlighting changes between versions
   - Support comparison of file metadata and layer structure
   - This feature is critical for Sofia as it allows her to visually identify changes between iterations of her artwork, helping her track the evolution of her designs and recover specific visual elements from previous versions

2. **Timeline-Based Version Browsing**
   - Develop an API for chronological organization of file versions
   - Implement efficient thumbnail generation for visual previews
   - Create metadata extraction for meaningful version labeling
   - Support filtering and searching across the version timeline
   - This timeline browsing capability enables Sofia to visualize the progression of her artwork over time, making it easy to locate specific iterations based on visual appearance rather than just dates or filenames

3. **Selective Element Restoration**
   - Design a system for identifying and extracting specific elements from backup versions
   - Implement layer-aware restoration for layered file formats
   - Create merge capabilities for combining elements from different versions
   - Support non-destructive restoration workflows
   - This selective restoration is essential as it allows Sofia to recover specific elements or details from previous versions without losing all the progress made in her current version, preserving her creative workflow

4. **Asset Library Deduplication**
   - Develop content-aware deduplication for creative assets
   - Implement reference tracking for linked files and embedded resources
   - Create intelligent identification of derivative assets
   - Support customizable organization of asset references
   - Efficient asset management is vital because Sofia works with large libraries of textures and reference materials that are often reused across projects, requiring smart storage that understands relationships between assets

5. **Workspace State Preservation**
   - Implement capture of application layouts and configurations
   - Create backup for tool presets and custom brushes
   - Support for saving viewport settings and camera positions
   - Enable restoration of complete working environment
   - This workspace preservation ensures that Sofia can restore not just her files but her entire creative environment, including custom tools, layouts, and viewport settings that are critical to her workflow

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Visual comparison algorithms must be testable with standard image test sets
- Timeline functionality must be verifiable with simulated version histories
- Selective restoration must be tested across various file formats
- Asset reference tracking must be validated with complex project structures
- Workspace state capture must be tested for compatibility with major creative applications

### Performance Expectations
- Generate visual difference comparisons in under 3 seconds for typical image sizes
- Produce thumbnails for timeline browsing in under 1 second per image
- Support asset libraries with 100,000+ files and complex relationships
- Handle project files up to 2GB with multi-layer complexity
- Complete workspace capture in under 10 seconds

### Integration Points
- Common creative file formats (PSD, AI, FBX, OBJ, etc.)
- Creative application APIs for workspace state
- Asset management systems and libraries
- Metadata standards for creative content
- Rendering and preview generation tools

### Key Constraints
- Must preserve exact fidelity of creative assets including color precision
- Storage format must maintain all layers and non-destructive edits
- System must be efficient with large media files (10GB+ project files)
- Operations must be non-disruptive to creative applications
- Must support industry-standard creative workflows

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Visual Comparison Engine**
   - Format-specific parsers for creative file types
   - Pixel-level comparison algorithms
   - Difference visualization generation
   - Metadata and structure comparison

2. **Version Timeline Management**
   - Chronological version tracking
   - Thumbnail generation and caching
   - Metadata extraction and indexing
   - Timeline query and filtering

3. **Selective Restoration Framework**
   - Element identification and extraction
   - Version merging and conflict resolution
   - Layer and component management
   - Non-destructive workflow support

4. **Asset Reference System**
   - Content-based identification
   - Reference graph construction
   - Duplicate detection and management
   - Storage optimization

5. **Workspace Capture**
   - Application state serialization
   - Configuration and preset management
   - Environment variable preservation
   - Cross-application compatibility

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of visual difference detection between file versions
- Proper organization and display of version timelines with previews
- Successful selective restoration of specific elements from backup versions
- Effective deduplication and reference management for asset libraries
- Complete capture and restoration of workspace states

### Critical User Scenarios
- Iterative development of complex multi-layered artwork
- Exploration of design alternatives with timeline browsing
- Recovery of specific elements from previous versions
- Management of large texture and reference libraries
- Restoration of complete working environment after system failure

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process visual differences for 100MB layered file in under 5 seconds
- Generate and display 100 thumbnails for timeline browsing in under 10 seconds
- Handle selective restoration from 1GB+ project files in under 30 seconds
- Achieve 50% or better storage savings through asset deduplication
- Complete workspace capture and restoration in under 15 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely complex file structures with hundreds of layers
- Proprietary or unusual file formats
- Corrupt or partially damaged creative files
- Broken references in asset libraries
- Incompatible workspace states between software versions

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage for visual comparison components
- 95% coverage for timeline management
- 90% coverage for selective restoration
- 95% coverage for asset reference management
- 90% coverage for workspace capture

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
