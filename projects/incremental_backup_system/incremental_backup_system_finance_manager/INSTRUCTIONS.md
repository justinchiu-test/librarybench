# FinanceVault - Personal Financial Document Backup System

## Overview
FinanceVault is a specialized incremental backup system designed for meticulous management of personal financial records and tax documents. It automatically classifies financial documents, implements calendar-aware retention, provides simplified yearly archiving, optimizes receipt images, and integrates with personal financial software to ensure complete and organized preservation of financial history.

## Persona Description
Chen meticulously tracks personal finances and tax documents for their family. They need a reliable backup system for financial records that simplifies tax preparation and protects against data loss.

## Key Requirements

1. **Financial Document Classification**
   - Implement intelligent categorization of statements, receipts, and tax forms
   - Create automatic metadata extraction from financial documents
   - Develop hierarchical organization by institution, account, and document type
   - Support custom tagging and categorization rules
   - This classification is critical for Chen as it automatically organizes the many financial documents their family receives, making it easy to locate specific records when needed for tax preparation or financial planning

2. **Calendar-Aware Retention Policies**
   - Design retention rules that understand tax deadlines and fiscal years
   - Implement jurisdiction-specific tax record requirements
   - Create automatic policy adjustment during tax seasons
   - Support for special handling of documents near retention thresholds
   - These intelligent retention policies ensure that Chen keeps tax records for the legally required period in their jurisdiction, automatically adjusting retention during tax season to prevent premature deletion of potentially needed documents

3. **Simplified Yearly Archiving**
   - Develop automated year-end financial record bundling
   - Implement tax-year organization and labeling
   - Create verification and completeness checking for yearly archives
   - Support for annotating and documenting yearly financial summaries
   - This archiving feature allows Chen to create permanent, organized records at the end of each tax year, simplifying future lookups and ensuring that complete financial history is preserved in a structured manner

4. **Receipt Image Optimization**
   - Design specialized handling for smartphone photos of paper receipts
   - Implement image enhancement, cropping, and text extraction
   - Create storage optimization for receipt images
   - Support correlation between receipt images and transaction records
   - This optimization is essential because Chen regularly captures paper receipts with their smartphone; the system ensures these images are properly processed for legibility, storage efficiency, and integration with their financial records

5. **Financial Software Integration**
   - Implement specialized backup for personal finance application data files
   - Create consistency checking between application data and document backups
   - Develop detection of financial application schema changes
   - Support for preserving transaction history across application versions
   - This integration ensures that Chen's financial application data (from software like Quicken or YNAB) is properly backed up alongside related documents, maintaining the relationship between transactions and supporting documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Document classification must be testable with standard financial document types
- Retention policy application must be verifiable throughout simulated tax years
- Yearly archiving must be tested for completeness and consistency
- Receipt optimization must be validated with various image qualities and formats
- Software integration must be tested with common financial application data formats

### Performance Expectations
- Classify 1000+ financial documents per hour with 95%+ accuracy
- Process retention policy application for 10,000+ documents in under 10 minutes
- Complete yearly archive creation for 5,000 documents in under 30 minutes
- Optimize and process 100 receipt images in under 5 minutes
- Handle financial software databases up to 1GB with consistent performance

### Integration Points
- Financial document formats (PDF, CSV, OFX, QFX, etc.)
- Personal finance software data files (Quicken, YNAB, Mint, etc.)
- Image processing libraries for receipt optimization
- OCR systems for text extraction
- Calendar and tax deadline databases

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain absolute data integrity for financial records
- System must operate within personal computing resource limitations
- All operations must be secure for sensitive financial information
- Storage format must remain accessible for long-term record keeping (7+ years)
- Must respect privacy and data security for family financial information

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Document Classification Engine**
   - Format-specific parsers for financial documents
   - Metadata extraction and indexing
   - Hierarchical organization implementation
   - Custom rule processing

2. **Retention Management**
   - Calendar-aware policy definition
   - Tax deadline integration
   - Automatic policy adjustment
   - Threshold detection and handling

3. **Archiving System**
   - Year-end bundling mechanism
   - Tax-year organization
   - Verification and completeness checking
   - Summary generation and annotation

4. **Receipt Processing**
   - Image enhancement algorithms
   - Text extraction and recognition
   - Storage optimization
   - Transaction correlation

5. **Application Integration**
   - Financial software data parsing
   - Consistency verification
   - Schema change handling
   - Transaction history preservation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate classification of various financial document types
- Proper application of retention policies based on tax calendars
- Successful creation and verification of yearly archives
- Effective optimization and processing of receipt images
- Reliable backup and restoration of financial software data

### Critical User Scenarios
- Monthly processing of bank statements, credit card statements, and receipts
- Approach of tax season with automatic retention policy adjustments
- Year-end archiving of complete financial records
- Capturing and processing receipts from everyday purchases
- Backing up financial software after significant transaction entry

### Performance Benchmarks
- Classify 100 mixed financial documents in under 5 minutes with 95% accuracy
- Update retention status of 5,000 documents based on tax calendar in under 5 minutes
- Create verified yearly archive for 1,000 documents in under 10 minutes
- Process and optimize 20 receipt images in under 2 minutes
- Backup and verify financial software data (100MB) in under 5 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Ambiguous or unusual financial document formats
- Documents with conflicting retention requirements
- Incomplete document sets for yearly archiving
- Very poor quality receipt images
- Corrupted or inconsistent financial software databases
- Multiple financial software versions with schema changes

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for document classification components
- 100% coverage for retention policy implementation
- 95% coverage for yearly archiving system
- 90% coverage for receipt optimization
- 95% coverage for financial software integration

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
