# FinanceBackup - Incremental Backup System for Personal Finance Management

## Overview
FinanceBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for individuals who meticulously track personal finances and tax documents. The system provides automatic financial document classification, calendar-aware retention policies, simplified yearly archiving, receipt image optimization, and financial software integration to help protect financial records and simplify tax preparation.

## Persona Description
Chen meticulously tracks personal finances and tax documents for their family. They need a reliable backup system for financial records that simplifies tax preparation and protects against data loss.

## Key Requirements

1. **Financial document classification**
   - Implement an intelligent classification system that automatically categorizes financial documents into appropriate types (statements, receipts, tax forms, invoices, etc.) based on content and layout
   - This automatic categorization is crucial for personal finance management as it eliminates tedious manual sorting, ensures consistent organization across years, and dramatically simplifies tax preparation and financial review by grouping similar documents together

2. **Calendar-aware retention policies**
   - Develop retention policies that automatically adjust based on tax seasons, fiscal years, and document types, applying appropriate preservation rules for different financial records
   - This temporal awareness is essential for properly maintaining financial records that have different legal retention requirements (7 years for tax documents, longer for property records, shorter for routine statements), ensuring compliance without requiring manual tracking

3. **Simplified yearly archiving**
   - Create an automated system for generating comprehensive year-end archives that bundle all financial records for a completed tax year into a permanent, well-organized collection
   - This yearly consolidation is vital for personal finance management, creating clear separation between tax years, simplifying future reference, and ensuring that complete yearly records remain intact and accessible for tax audits or financial planning

4. **Receipt image optimization**
   - Develop specialized handling for smartphone photos of paper receipts, including enhancement, text extraction, standardization, and storage optimization
   - This receipt-specific functionality addresses the reality that many important financial records begin as hastily-captured phone photos, ensuring these documents remain legible over time while minimizing storage requirements and improving searchability

5. **Financial software integration**
   - Implement integration with personal accounting applications to back up their database files, transaction history, and configuration in a consistent, application-aware manner
   - This software integration is critical because financial data often resides in specialized applications with proprietary formats, requiring application-specific knowledge to properly capture and preserve complete financial records that can be restored without data loss

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Document classification must be tested with a diverse corpus of financial document types
- Calendar-aware policies must be verified across multiple fiscal years and tax jurisdictions
- Receipt processing must be tested with varied image quality and lighting conditions
- Financial software integration must be validated with common accounting applications

### Performance Expectations
- Document classification should process at least 10 documents per second
- Yearly archive generation should complete in under 10 minutes for typical personal finance volumes
- Receipt optimization should process images in under 3 seconds per receipt
- The system should handle at least 10,000 financial documents efficiently
- Incremental backups should identify and store only changed financial records to minimize backup time

### Integration Points
- Must support common personal finance software formats (Quicken, YNAB, GnuCash, etc.)
- Should provide plugins for financial document scanners and capture applications
- Must interface with common cloud storage platforms for secure offsite backup
- Should support import/export with tax preparation software

### Key Constraints
- The solution must maintain strict privacy for sensitive financial information
- All operations must preserve document fidelity for potential audit purposes
- The system must function without requiring accounting expertise
- Storage format must remain accessible for long-term record retention (7+ years)
- The implementation must be suitable for non-technical users while maintaining robust functionality

## Core Functionality

The FinanceBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **Financial Document Analyzer**
   - Content-based classification of financial documents
   - Metadata extraction from various document formats
   - Organizational schema for different financial document types

2. **Calendar-Based Retention Engine**
   - Time-aware policy definition and enforcement
   - Tax calendar integration and awareness
   - Document lifespan management across multiple years

3. **Archival Management System**
   - Year-end consolidation and organization
   - Permanent record creation and verification
   - Searchable archive generation with appropriate metadata

4. **Receipt Processing Pipeline**
   - Image enhancement for smartphone-captured receipts
   - Text extraction and recognition for search capabilities
   - Storage optimization for image-based financial records

5. **Financial Application Connector**
   - Database and configuration backup for finance applications
   - Format-specific handling for various financial software
   - Consistent point-in-time capture of financial data

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify accurate classification of various financial document types
- Confirm proper application of calendar-aware retention policies
- Test yearly archive creation and organization
- Validate receipt image processing and enhancement
- Verify financial software integration for data consistency

### Critical User Scenarios
- Tax preparation requiring access to previous year's documents
- IRS audit requiring retrieval of specific financial records
- Financial review spanning multiple years of data
- Recovery after financial software corruption or failure
- Migration of financial records between different systems

### Performance Benchmarks
- Document classification must achieve at least 95% accuracy for common financial documents
- Calendar-aware retention must correctly apply policies to 100% of test documents
- Yearly archiving must successfully consolidate complete financial records within 5 minutes
- Receipt image processing must improve legibility for at least 90% of test images
- Financial software integration must capture all essential data for successful restoration

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle documents with ambiguous classification characteristics
- Proper handling of documents spanning multiple tax years or fiscal periods
- Correct operation with unusually formatted financial documents
- Graceful processing of severely degraded receipt images
- Recovery from interrupted backup operations without data loss

### Required Test Coverage
- Document classification must be tested with documents from major financial institutions
- Calendar awareness must be verified across different fiscal year definitions
- Receipt processing must be tested with various image qualities and capture conditions
- Financial software integration must be verified with actual application databases
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested for data safety
