# GameVault - Iterative Game Development Backup System

## Overview
GameVault is a specialized incremental backup system designed for indie game developers who need to track build versions alongside player feedback, efficiently manage game assets, preserve playtest sessions, mark development milestones, and handle cross-platform configurations, all while minimizing storage requirements and maximizing restoration capabilities.

## Persona Description
Mateo creates indie games with frequent iterations and extensive playtesting feedback. He needs to track game builds alongside player feedback data to reference when making design decisions.

## Key Requirements

1. **Build Correlation with Player Feedback**
   - Implement linking system between specific game builds and related feedback
   - Create metadata tagging for build-feedback relationships
   - Develop search and filtering capabilities across feedback datasets
   - Support for statistical analysis of feedback across build versions
   - This correlation is critical for Mateo as it allows him to track how specific changes impact player experience, giving context to feedback and enabling data-driven design decisions based on how players respond to different builds

2. **Asset Bundle Tracking and Optimization**
   - Design specialized handling for game engine asset bundles
   - Implement content-aware deduplication for large binary resources
   - Create delta compression optimized for common game asset types
   - Support for dependency tracking between assets
   - This feature is essential because game projects contain large binary assets that require significant storage space; efficient tracking and storage of these resources enables Mateo to maintain a complete version history without excessive storage requirements

3. **Playtesting Session Preservation**
   - Develop capture mechanisms for in-game states and player progression
   - Implement session replay data storage and indexing
   - Create analytics preservation for playtest metrics
   - Support correlation between player actions and game state
   - Session preservation allows Mateo to reconstruct exactly what happened during playtests, giving vital context to player feedback and enabling him to reproduce and understand specific gameplay scenarios that led to player reactions

4. **Development Milestone Snapshots**
   - Implement significant milestone marking and annotation
   - Create comprehensive project state capture at key development points
   - Develop comparison tools between milestone versions
   - Support for milestone-specific metadata and documentation
   - These milestone snapshots allow Mateo to mark and preserve important stages in his game's development, creating stable reference points with context that he can return to when needed for design decisions or troubleshooting

5. **Cross-Platform Configuration Management**
   - Design backup for settings across multiple deployment targets
   - Implement platform-specific configuration tracking
   - Create conflict detection and resolution for cross-platform settings
   - Support synchronization of compatible settings
   - This configuration management is vital because Mateo develops for multiple platforms, and needs to track platform-specific settings while maintaining consistency where appropriate, ensuring his game works correctly across all target platforms

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All feedback correlation must be testable with simulated player data
- Asset bundle optimization must be verifiable with representative game assets
- Playtesting capture must be testable with recorded game sessions
- Milestone snapshots must be validatable for completeness
- Configuration management must be testable across simulated platforms

### Performance Expectations
- Support projects up to 100GB with thousands of assets
- Process and correlate feedback for 1000+ playtest sessions
- Handle asset bundles up to 2GB with efficient delta storage
- Complete milestone snapshots within 15 minutes for full project
- Manage configurations for 5+ target platforms simultaneously

### Integration Points
- Game engine asset pipelines (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.)
- Playtest feedback collection systems
- Analytics and telemetry platforms
- Build automation systems
- Cross-platform deployment tools

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain exact binary reproduction of game builds
- Storage optimization is critical for large asset files
- System must handle both source assets and compiled bundles
- Operations must not interfere with development or build processes
- Must support common game development workflows and tools

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Feedback Correlation Engine**
   - Build-feedback relationship tracking
   - Metadata tagging and organization
   - Search and filtering implementation
   - Statistical analysis tools

2. **Asset Management System**
   - Game-engine specific asset handling
   - Content-aware deduplication
   - Delta compression for binary assets
   - Dependency graph construction

3. **Playtest Capture Framework**
   - Session state recording
   - Player progression tracking
   - Analytics data preservation
   - Correlation and indexing

4. **Milestone Management**
   - Significant point marking
   - Comprehensive state capture
   - Version comparison tools
   - Documentation and annotation

5. **Platform Configuration Handler**
   - Multi-platform settings tracking
   - Platform-specific organization
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Settings synchronization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate correlation between game builds and player feedback
- Efficient storage and retrieval of large game assets
- Complete preservation of playtesting sessions and player progression
- Reliable creation and restoration of development milestones
- Proper management of cross-platform configuration settings

### Critical User Scenarios
- Release of game build for playtesting with subsequent feedback collection
- Iteration on game with significant asset changes requiring efficient storage
- Analysis of player behavior across multiple builds to inform design decisions
- Creation of stable milestone before implementing risky new feature
- Maintaining consistent configuration across multiple deployment platforms

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process and correlate feedback from 100 playtest sessions in under 5 minutes
- Achieve 80% or better space savings for iterative versions of large assets
- Capture and index complete playtest session data at a rate of 50 sessions per hour
- Create full project milestone snapshot (50GB) in under 10 minutes
- Synchronize configuration changes across 5 platforms in under 2 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely large or complex asset bundles
- Corrupted or inconsistent feedback data
- Incomplete playtest session recordings
- Failed milestone creation due to project inconsistencies
- Irreconcilable platform-specific configuration conflicts
- Build processes that modify assets during compilation

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage for feedback correlation components
- 95% coverage for asset management system
- 90% coverage for playtest capture framework
- 95% coverage for milestone management
- 90% coverage for platform configuration handling

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
