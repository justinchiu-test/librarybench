# GameDevBackup - Incremental Backup System for Game Developers

## Overview
GameDevBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for game developers who create indie games with frequent iterations and extensive playtesting feedback. The system provides build correlation with player feedback, efficient asset bundle tracking, playtesting session preservation, development milestone snapshots, and cross-platform configuration management to help track game versions and player responses throughout the development process.

## Persona Description
Mateo creates indie games with frequent iterations and extensive playtesting feedback. He needs to track game builds alongside player feedback data to reference when making design decisions.

## Key Requirements

1. **Build correlation with player feedback**
   - Implement a system that links specific game builds with corresponding player feedback data, creating traceable connections between versions and user responses
   - This correlation is crucial for game development as it enables developers to understand exactly which version of the game received specific feedback, allowing precise analysis of how design changes affect player experience and ensuring design decisions are based on accurate version-specific data

2. **Asset bundle tracking**
   - Develop specialized storage and tracking for large binary game assets that optimizes backup size while maintaining version history for textures, models, audio, and other resource-intensive game elements
   - This optimization is essential for game development where asset bundles often constitute the majority of project size (sometimes gigabytes per version), enabling comprehensive version control without excessive storage demands

3. **Playtesting session preservation**
   - Create a system that captures and preserves in-game states and player progression during playtesting sessions, linking gameplay data with the specific build being tested
   - This session data preservation allows developers to review actual gameplay experiences later, recreate reported bugs in context, and analyze patterns across multiple playtest sessions, providing crucial insights for game balancing and experience refinement

4. **Development milestone snapshots**
   - Implement a milestone system for marking significant development points with annotations, creating labeled reference points in the project's evolution
   - These milestone snapshots serve as stable reference versions for comparison, demonstration, and possible rollback targets, helping developers track major progress points and maintain perspective on the project's evolution over time

5. **Cross-platform configuration management**
   - Develop a backup system that tracks and manages platform-specific configurations and settings across multiple deployment targets (PC, mobile, console, etc.)
   - This configuration management ensures consistent experience across platforms while allowing platform-specific optimizations, helping developers maintain the increasing complexity of multi-platform games without losing track of platform-specific adjustments

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 85% code coverage
- Build correlation must be verified through mock feedback and version scenarios
- Asset bundle handling must be tested with various game engine asset types and sizes
- Playtest data preservation must be validated with simulated gameplay sessions
- Cross-platform configuration tests must cover major deployment platforms

### Performance Expectations
- Full game project backup (including assets) should complete in under 30 minutes for 10GB projects
- Build correlation lookups should return results in under 3 seconds
- Asset bundle deduplication should achieve at least 60% storage savings for typical iteration patterns
- Milestone snapshots should be created in under 5 minutes even for large projects
- The system should handle at least 100 builds with associated feedback data efficiently

### Integration Points
- Must support major game engine project formats (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.)
- Should provide plugins or hooks for playtesting tools and feedback systems
- Must interface with common version control systems used in game development
- Should support integration with build automation and continuous integration pipelines

### Key Constraints
- The solution must function with limited technical knowledge (accessible to solo developers)
- Large binary assets must be handled efficiently without excessive duplication
- The system must not interfere with game engine performance during development
- All operations must be reversible to support game design experimentation
- The implementation must work with variable hardware capabilities of indie developers

## Core Functionality

The GameDevBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **Game Build Versioning Engine**
   - Specialized handling for game project structures and build artifacts
   - Version tracking with build metadata and configuration details
   - Build comparison and difference highlighting

2. **Feedback Correlation System**
   - Mapping between specific builds and player feedback
   - Feedback data organization and search capabilities
   - Trend analysis across multiple build iterations

3. **Asset Bundle Manager**
   - Efficient storage and versioning of large binary game assets
   - Deduplication specifically optimized for texture, model, and audio files
   - Delta encoding where applicable for iterative asset changes

4. **Playtesting Data Vault**
   - Capture and storage of gameplay session data
   - In-game state preservation and reproducibility
   - Player progression tracking across game versions

5. **Milestone Management Framework**
   - Significant version marking and annotation
   - Comparative analysis between milestone versions
   - Selective restoration to milestone states

6. **Cross-Platform Configuration Tracker**
   - Platform-specific settings management
   - Configuration dependency tracking
   - Deployment target organization and correlation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify accurate correlation between builds and associated feedback
- Confirm efficient storage and retrieval of large asset bundles
- Test playtesting session preservation and reproduction
- Validate milestone marking and restoration capabilities
- Verify cross-platform configuration tracking across target platforms

### Critical User Scenarios
- Major gameplay mechanic change requiring before/after feedback comparison
- Art style pivot requiring selective asset restoration
- Bug report investigation requiring specific playtesting session analysis
- Pre-release milestone recovery for demonstration purposes
- Cross-platform configuration adjustment across multiple deployment targets

### Performance Benchmarks
- Build correlation lookups must complete in under 2 seconds for projects with 100+ builds
- Asset bundle storage must achieve at least a 50% reduction compared to full copies
- Playtesting session data must be retrieved and loaded in under 30 seconds
- Milestone snapshot creation must process at least 1GB per minute
- The system must support at least 5 concurrent platform configurations without confusion

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle extremely large individual assets (4GB+)
- Proper operation with corrupted or incomplete build artifacts
- Correct handling of contradictory player feedback for the same build
- Graceful management of cross-platform configuration conflicts
- Recovery from interrupted backup operations without project corruption

### Required Test Coverage
- Build correlation must be tested with various feedback formats and volumes
- Asset handling must be verified with all common game asset types
- Playtesting session preservation must be tested with different gameplay patterns
- Milestone operations must be verified for projects of varying sizes and complexities
- Cross-platform configurations must be tested against actual deployment targets
