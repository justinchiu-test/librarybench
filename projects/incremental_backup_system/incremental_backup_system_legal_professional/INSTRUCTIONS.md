# LegalVault - Evidentiary-Grade Document Backup System

## Overview
LegalVault is a specialized incremental backup system designed for law firms handling sensitive client documents with strict chain of custody requirements. The system provides legal hold enforcement, tamper-proof audit logging, intelligent handling of redacted content, case-based organization, and jurisdiction-specific retention policies to meet the stringent requirements of legal practice.

## Persona Description
Eleanor works at a law firm handling sensitive client documents requiring strict chain of custody. She needs to maintain verifiable document history with tamper-proof audit logs for evidentiary purposes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Legal Hold Functionality**
   - Implement immutable preservation of designated backup sets
   - Create legal hold classification and tagging system
   - Develop hold enforcement that overrides normal retention policies
   - Support for hold notification and acknowledgment tracking
   - This feature is critical for Eleanor as it prevents modification or deletion of documents subject to litigation holds, protecting the firm from spoliation claims and sanctions by ensuring evidence remains pristine and admissible in court

2. **Chain of Custody Documentation**
   - Design comprehensive audit logging of all document access and actions
   - Implement cryptographic verification of log integrity
   - Create detailed tracking of restoration attempts and activities
   - Support exportable chain of custody reports for legal proceedings
   - This documentation is essential as it provides defensible evidence of document authenticity by recording every interaction with the backup system, crucial for maintaining document admissibility and withstanding legal challenges

3. **Redaction-Aware Backup Handling**
   - Develop detection of redacted content in documents
   - Implement specialized storage for pre and post-redaction versions
   - Create access controls specific to redaction status
   - Support for tracking redaction decisions and authorizations
   - This redaction awareness ensures that documents containing confidential information are handled appropriately, preventing accidental disclosure of privileged content while maintaining document history

4. **Case-Based Organization**
   - Implement organization structure mirroring law firm's matter management
   - Create matter/case hierarchies with appropriate metadata
   - Develop client and case linking with conflict checking
   - Support for matter lifecycle management within backups
   - This organization is vital as it aligns backup structures with how attorneys naturally work, enabling Eleanor to quickly locate documents by case and maintain proper client-matter segregation required for legal practice

5. **Jurisdiction-Specific Retention Policies**
   - Design rule engine for implementing retention requirements by jurisdiction
   - Create conflict resolution for multi-jurisdictional matters
   - Implement practice area-specific retention rules
   - Support automated disposition with approval workflows
   - These specialized retention policies ensure the firm complies with varying legal requirements across different jurisdictions and practice areas, protecting against both premature destruction and unnecessary retention of sensitive materials

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Legal hold mechanisms must be verifiable for absolute enforcement
- Chain of custody logs must be testable for tamper resistance
- Redaction handling must be validated for security across all document types
- Case organization must be tested for proper segregation and access control
- Retention policies must be verified against regulatory requirements

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 10 million documents with full audit history
- Legal hold application should be processed within 30 minutes for large matters
- Chain of custody reports should generate in under 2 minutes
- Case organization should maintain responsiveness with 100,000+ matters
- Retention analysis should process 100,000 documents per hour

### Integration Points
- Document management systems used by legal firms
- E-discovery platforms and litigation support software
- Matter management and practice management systems
- Court filing systems for chain of custody documentation
- Client portals for secure access and disposition approval

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain defensible chain of custody for all documents
- All operations must be non-repudiable with cryptographic verification
- System must operate within attorney-client privilege boundaries
- Backup and access must comply with bar association rules
- Storage must meet standards for evidentiary admissibility

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Legal Hold Engine**
   - Hold classification and tagging
   - Immutable storage implementation
   - Policy override mechanisms
   - Notification and acknowledgment tracking

2. **Custody Chain Management**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Cryptographic log verification
   - Access and activity tracking
   - Chain of custody reporting

3. **Redaction Processing**
   - Content analysis for redaction detection
   - Version management for redacted documents
   - Access control by redaction status
   - Authorization tracking

4. **Matter Organization**
   - Case hierarchy implementation
   - Client-matter association
   - Conflict checking integration
   - Matter lifecycle management

5. **Retention Management**
   - Jurisdiction rule engine
   - Practice area policy implementation
   - Conflict resolution logic
   - Disposition workflow

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Absolute enforcement of legal holds against any modification attempts
- Tamper-evident audit logs that detect any unauthorized changes
- Proper handling of redacted content with appropriate access controls
- Correct organization of documents within the case management structure
- Accurate application of retention policies based on jurisdiction and practice area

### Critical User Scenarios
- Applying legal hold to documents related to active litigation
- Generating chain of custody report for document presented as evidence
- Handling document with multiple redacted versions for different audiences
- Organization of documents from multi-jurisdictional, multi-client matter
- Application of appropriate retention based on changing jurisdictional rules

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process legal hold application to 100,000 documents in under 1 hour
- Generate tamper-proof audit log for 5 years of document history in under 5 minutes
- Handle 10,000 redacted documents with their original versions with appropriate access controls
- Maintain organization performance with 100,000+ matters and 10 million+ documents
- Apply retention rules to 100,000 documents in under 1 hour

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Conflicting legal holds from multiple matters
- Attempt to modify documents under legal hold
- Redacted document with inconsistent versions
- Case reorganization or renumbering
- Conflicting retention requirements across jurisdictions
- Partial backup restoration for privilege review

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of legal hold mechanisms
- 100% coverage of chain of custody logging
- 95% coverage of redaction handling
- 90% coverage of case organization
- 95% coverage of retention policy implementation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The system proves capable of absolutely preventing modification or deletion of documents under legal hold
2. Chain of custody documentation provides cryptographically verifiable proof of document handling suitable for court proceedings
3. Redacted content is properly identified and handled with appropriate access controls and version tracking
4. Documents are organized in a structure that mirrors the firm's matter management system for intuitive access
5. Retention policies correctly implement the requirements of different jurisdictions and practice areas
