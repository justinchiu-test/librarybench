# LegalVault - Incremental Backup System for Legal Professionals

## Overview
LegalVault is a specialized incremental backup system designed for legal professionals who handle sensitive client documents requiring strict chain of custody. The system provides legal hold functionality, comprehensive chain of custody documentation, redaction-aware backup handling, case-based organization, and jurisdiction-specific retention policies to ensure compliance with legal requirements and evidentiary standards.

## Persona Description
Eleanor works at a law firm handling sensitive client documents requiring strict chain of custody. She needs to maintain verifiable document history with tamper-proof audit logs for evidentiary purposes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Legal hold functionality**
   - Implement a comprehensive legal hold system that prevents modification or deletion of designated backup sets, even by administrators, once a legal hold is applied
   - This capability is critical for ensuring that potential evidence remains pristine and unchanged during litigation, preventing spoliation claims and maintaining the integrity of legal proceedings by locking down relevant materials

2. **Chain of custody documentation**
   - Develop a cryptographically secure audit system that records all access, view, modification, and restoration attempts for every document, creating an immutable chain of custody record suitable for court submission
   - This detailed audit trail is essential for establishing and defending document authenticity in legal proceedings, providing verifiable evidence that documents remained unaltered during their lifecycle

3. **Redaction-aware backup handling**
   - Create intelligent backup processes that recognize redacted content and apply special handling to ensure that both redacted and unredacted versions are properly preserved while maintaining appropriate access controls
   - This specialized handling addresses the complex requirements of legal documents that exist in multiple states (original, partially redacted, fully redacted), ensuring proper retention while preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information

4. **Case-based organization**
   - Implement an organizational system that mirrors the firm's matter management structure, automatically categorizing documents by case/matter and maintaining relationships between related documents
   - This organization framework aligns backups with how legal professionals actually work, ensuring that all documents related to a specific case can be easily located and restored together, maintaining vital context and relationships

5. **Jurisdiction-specific retention policies**
   - Develop a configurable policy engine that implements the specific legal requirements for different jurisdictions and practice areas, automatically enforcing appropriate retention schedules
   - These customizable retention rules are vital for ensuring compliance with the complex and varied legal retention requirements across different jurisdictions, practice areas, and matter types

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 95% code coverage
- Legal hold functionality must be verified through penetration testing attempts
- Chain of custody mechanisms must be cryptographically verifiable through independent tests
- Redaction handling must be tested with various document types and redaction methods
- Retention policies must be validated against actual jurisdictional requirements

### Performance Expectations
- Legal holds must be applied in under 30 seconds, even to large document collections
- Chain of custody records must be generated with less than 100ms overhead per operation
- The system should handle at least 10 million documents across 50,000 legal matters
- Case organization operations should complete in under 5 minutes for 100,000 documents
- Retention policy application should process 10,000 documents per minute

### Integration Points
- Must interface with standard document management systems and legal software
- Should provide secure API endpoints for integration with case management systems
- Must support standard legal document formats (including Bates numbering)
- Should integrate with electronic discovery (e-discovery) platforms

### Key Constraints
- The solution must maintain CJIS, HIPAA, and client confidentiality compliance
- Chain of custody records must be immutable and tamper-evident
- The system must enforce ethical walls between cases when required
- All operations must be defensible in court if challenged
- The implementation must operate within attorney-client privilege boundaries

## Core Functionality

The LegalVault system must implement these core components:

1. **Legal Hold Manager**
   - Hold application and enforcement mechanisms
   - Preservation notice tracking and documentation
   - Hold removal authorization with multi-party verification

2. **Chain of Custody Tracking System**
   - Immutable audit logging of all document interactions
   - Cryptographic verification of document integrity
   - Court-ready reporting of chain of custody details

3. **Redaction Management Framework**
   - Detection and tracking of redacted content
   - Secure storage of both redacted and unredacted versions
   - Access control based on redaction status and user authorization

4. **Case Organization Engine**
   - Matter/case structure mirroring and maintenance
   - Document relationship tracking and association
   - Hierarchical organization with metadata enrichment

5. **Retention Policy Controller**
   - Rule-based policy definition and enforcement
   - Jurisdictional requirement implementation
   - Exception handling for special retention needs

6. **Evidentiary Production System**
   - Court-ready export with verification certificates
   - Preservation of metadata during extraction
   - Controlled document collection for outside counsel

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify that legal holds properly prevent modification and deletion
- Confirm complete and accurate chain of custody tracking
- Test proper handling of redacted documents in various formats
- Validate case-based organization across different matter structures
- Verify correct application of jurisdiction-specific retention policies

### Critical User Scenarios
- Responding to discovery requests with proper document production
- Implementing legal holds across multiple matters and document types
- Managing documents through the complete case lifecycle
- Handling sensitive client information with appropriate confidentiality
- Demonstrating document authenticity in legal proceedings

### Performance Benchmarks
- Legal hold application must complete in under 1 minute for matters with up to 100,000 documents
- Chain of custody recording must add less than 5% overhead to standard operations
- Case organization must correctly categorize at least 99.5% of documents automatically
- Retention policy enforcement must process at least 5,000 documents per minute
- The system must support at least 500 concurrent users without performance degradation

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle conflicting legal holds appropriately
- Proper handling of documents subject to multiple jurisdictions
- Correct operation when dealing with corrupt or partial documents
- Graceful handling of attempted unauthorized access to privileged content
- Recovery from interrupted operations without compromising chain of custody

### Required Test Coverage
- Legal hold functionality must have 100% test coverage
- Chain of custody mechanisms must be verified through cryptographic validation
- All retention policies must be tested against actual jurisdictional requirements
- Case organization must be tested with various firm structure models
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested for legal compliance

## Success Criteria
