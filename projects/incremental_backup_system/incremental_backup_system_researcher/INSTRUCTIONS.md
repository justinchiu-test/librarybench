# ResearchVault - Provenance-Tracking Backup System for Scientific Data

## Overview
ResearchVault is a specialized incremental backup system designed for academic researchers that tracks data provenance, preserves experimental context, and ensures reproducibility of computational research. The system creates citable backup snapshots, facilitates secure collaboration, and validates scientific datasets while providing comprehensive version history.

## Persona Description
Dr. Rivera conducts computational research generating large datasets from experiments. He needs to preserve both raw data and analysis scripts with proper attribution and provenance tracking for academic integrity and reproducibility.

## Key Requirements

1. **Provenance Tracking System**
   - Implement comprehensive tracking of relationships between input data, analysis scripts, and output results
   - Create dependency graphs showing how files are derived from one another
   - Record execution environment details (libraries, versions, parameters) with each analysis run
   - Support for workflow reconstruction from provenance metadata
   - This feature is critical for Dr. Rivera as it demonstrates the scientific integrity of his research by providing a complete audit trail of how results were generated, essential for reproducibility and peer review

2. **Research Notebook Integration**
   - Develop APIs for capturing context and parameters from computational notebooks
   - Support for Jupyter, R Markdown, and other research notebook formats
   - Preserve code, outputs, and visualizations in their original context
   - Enable version control of notebooks with cell-level granularity
   - This integration is essential because it preserves the experimental context and researcher notes alongside the data, providing crucial information about methodology and decision-making that might otherwise be lost

3. **Citation-Ready Backup Snapshots**
   - Create immutable, timestamped snapshots of research datasets and code
   - Generate persistent identifiers (DOI-compatible) for backup snapshots
   - Include comprehensive metadata following academic citation standards
   - Support export in formats suitable for data repositories
   - This feature allows Dr. Rivera to properly cite specific versions of datasets in publications, increasing research transparency and enabling other researchers to access the exact data used

4. **Collaborative Backup Policies**
   - Implement secure sharing mechanisms for research team collaboration
   - Create granular access controls for different parts of the research data
   - Support for distributed backup across multiple research locations
   - Maintain comprehensive logs of who accessed or modified data
   - Collaborative features ensure that research teams can work together effectively while maintaining data integrity and properly attributing contributions across team members

5. **Data Validation Tools**
   - Develop schema validation for scientific datasets
   - Implement statistical anomaly detection for identifying potential data corruption
   - Create automated quality checks for common data formats
   - Support for custom validation rules specific to research domains
   - These validation capabilities are crucial for ensuring the integrity and quality of scientific data during backup and restoration, preventing corrupted or anomalous data from compromising research results

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All provenance tracking functionality must be verifiable through simulated research workflows
- Notebook integration must be tested with actual notebook files of various formats
- Citation mechanisms must be validated against academic publishing standards
- Collaboration features must be tested for security and consistency
- Validation tools must be tested against both valid and intentionally corrupted datasets

### Performance Expectations
- Support for large scientific datasets (up to multi-TB scale)
- Efficient handling of high-dimensional array data common in scientific computing
- Backup operations should complete within specified maintenance windows
- Provenance graph operations should be responsive for datasets with thousands of derived files
- System should handle high-frequency backups during active experimental runs

### Integration Points
- Scientific computing environments (Python, R, Julia, etc.)
- Notebook platforms (Jupyter, RStudio, etc.)
- Data repositories and citation systems (DataCite, Zenodo, etc.)
- High-performance computing job schedulers
- Domain-specific data formats (HDF5, NetCDF, FITS, etc.)

### Key Constraints
- Must preserve exact numerical precision of scientific data
- All operations must be reproducible and deterministic
- System must work in airgapped research environments
- Storage format must remain accessible for long-term archiving (10+ years)
- Must accommodate domain-specific data validation requirements

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Provenance Management**
   - Relationship tracking between data artifacts
   - Execution environment capture
   - Dependency graph generation and querying
   - Workflow reconstruction capabilities

2. **Notebook Handling**
   - Format-specific parsers for research notebooks
   - Cell-level version control
   - Output and visualization preservation
   - Context extraction and indexing

3. **Citation Engine**
   - Snapshot creation and immutability enforcement
   - Identifier generation and registration
   - Metadata management following academic standards
   - Repository export capabilities

4. **Collaboration Framework**
   - Access control and permission management
   - Distributed backup synchronization
   - Activity tracking and attribution
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

5. **Scientific Data Validation**
   - Schema validation for common scientific formats
   - Statistical quality control
   - Domain-specific rule processing
   - Anomaly detection and reporting

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate and complete capture of provenance relationships
- Proper preservation of notebook content and context
- Conformance of citation metadata to academic standards
- Effective enforcement of collaborative access controls
- Reliability of data validation for detecting corruption or anomalies

### Critical User Scenarios
- Multi-stage computational experiment generating derived datasets
- Collaborative research project with distributed team members
- Preparation of datasets for publication and citation
- Validation and verification of externally provided research data
- Reproduction of previous results using archived code and data

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process backup of 100GB dataset within 4 hours
- Generate provenance graph for workflow with 1000+ dependencies in under 30 seconds
- Support concurrent access from at least 20 research team members
- Complete validation of 10GB structured scientific dataset in under 10 minutes
- Restore specific experimental state from backup in under 15 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Incomplete provenance information from manual research steps
- Extremely large or complex notebooks exceeding normal parameters
- Corrupted or partially damaged scientific datasets
- Conflicting modifications in collaborative scenarios
- Resource exhaustion during backup of very large datasets

- 95% code coverage for provenance tracking components
- 100% coverage for citation and metadata handling
- 90% coverage for collaborative features
- 95% coverage for validation tools
- 100% coverage for critical data integrity functions

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
