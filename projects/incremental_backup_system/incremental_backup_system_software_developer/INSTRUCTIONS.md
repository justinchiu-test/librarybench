# DevBackup - Incremental Backup System for Software Developers

## Overview
DevBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed specifically for software developers who manage multiple client projects. It intelligently tracks code changes, prioritizes source files, integrates with version control systems, and optimizes backup schedules based on active coding sessions, providing comprehensive version history without consuming excessive storage space.

## Persona Description
Mariana is a freelance software developer managing multiple client projects simultaneously on her laptop. She needs a reliable backup system that can intelligently track project file changes without consuming excessive storage space while allowing her to reference or restore previous versions of code.

## Key Requirements

1. **Programming language-aware backup policies**
   - Implement intelligent backup policies that detect and prioritize source code, configuration files, and project assets based on file types, extensions, and content patterns
   - This feature is critical for ensuring that essential development files receive the highest backup priority and frequency, while less critical generated files (like build artifacts) receive appropriate handling

2. **Version control system integration**
   - Create a system that detects and interfaces with common VCS (.git, .svn, etc.) to avoid duplicating already versioned files while still providing backups for uncommitted changes
   - This integration prevents wasteful storage of files already preserved in version control while ensuring that work-in-progress changes are still protected

3. **Project-based organization with tagging**
   - Implement a project organization system that automatically groups related files together with customizable tagging for easier navigation and restoration
   - This organization system is essential for developers juggling multiple client projects, allowing them to quickly locate and restore specific project components without searching through chronological backups

4. **Intelligent scheduling for coding sessions**
   - Develop an activity detection system that recognizes active coding sessions and automatically triggers backups after significant changes or completion of work sessions
   - This smart scheduling ensures timely backups without interrupting the developer's workflow, balancing data protection with productivity

5. **Code pattern cross-reference tools**
   - Create a search and indexing system that can identify when specific code patterns were introduced, modified, or removed across backup history
   - This feature allows developers to trace the evolution of specific code implementations, helping them recover lost solutions or understand the history of particular code sections

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must verify the correct behavior of the backup system with various programming languages and project structures
- Mock version control repositories must be used to test VCS integration features
- Performance tests must verify backup efficiency for repositories of varying sizes (small to large codebases)

### Performance Expectations
- Initial full backup of a 1GB codebase should complete in under 5 minutes on standard hardware
- Incremental backups should take less than 30 seconds for typical coding session changes
- The system should maintain efficient storage, with backup size not exceeding 2x the original codebase size even with 30 days of frequent changes
- Search and pattern recognition features should return results in under 3 seconds even for large backup histories

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with common version control systems (Git, SVN, Mercurial)
- Should provide a Python API for custom rule development and integration with IDEs
- Must work with standard file systems and support local and network storage targets
- Should offer hooks for notification systems (e.g., desktop notifications, email)

### Key Constraints
- The solution must minimize CPU usage during active development sessions
- The implementation must not require administrative privileges to function
- Backup operations must be atomic - either fully complete or fully rollback
- The system must maintain data integrity even with unexpected power loss

## Core Functionality

The DevBackup system must implement these core components:

1. **File Monitoring and Change Detection**
   - A subsystem that monitors the file system for changes, detecting when files are created, modified, or deleted
   - Intelligent filtering based on file types and programming languages
   - Detection of build artifacts and generated content that should be handled differently

2. **Delta Storage Engine**
   - An efficient storage mechanism that saves only the changes between versions of text files
   - Specialized handling for common development file types
   - Deduplication system that recognizes common code patterns and libraries

3. **Project Analyzer**
   - Component that identifies project boundaries and relationships between files
   - Automatic recognition of project structures for common frameworks and languages
   - Custom tagging system for manual organization when automatic detection is insufficient

4. **Version Control Integration**
   - Modules that interface with Git, SVN, and other VCS
   - Smart detection of repository boundaries and status
   - Differential backup of uncommitted changes

5. **Activity Detection and Scheduling**
   - Monitoring system that detects active coding sessions
   - Intelligent scheduling algorithms that balance data protection with minimal interruption
   - Configuration system for developer preferences and work patterns

6. **Code Pattern Indexing and Search**
   - Indexing engine for efficient code content searching across backup history
   - Pattern matching algorithms for identifying code evolution
   - Query interface for finding when specific code patterns were introduced or modified

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Verify correct detection and handling of different programming languages and file types
- Confirm proper integration with version control systems, including accurate detection of repository boundaries
- Test project organization and tagging functionality for various project structures
- Validate intelligent scheduling behavior under different coding activity patterns
- Verify accuracy and performance of code pattern search across backup history

### Critical User Scenarios
- Full project backup and restoration to a specific point in time
- Recovery of deleted files or code fragments from backup history
- Handling of multiple simultaneous projects with different technologies
- Migration of backups between different storage locations
- Disaster recovery simulation with complete system restoration

### Performance Benchmarks
- Backup completion time must not exceed 1 minute for typical incremental changes
- Storage efficiency must achieve at least 50% savings compared to full backups for text-based files
- Search operations must complete in under 3 seconds for codebases up to 1GB
- System resource usage must remain below 10% CPU and 200MB RAM during normal operation
- Restoration operations must achieve a throughput of at least 50MB/s

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- The system must handle corrupt or incomplete backup states gracefully
- Proper handling of symbolic links, hard links, and special files
- Correct operation with unusual filenames and paths, including Unicode characters
- Graceful handling of network interruptions when using remote storage
- Recovery from interrupted backup operations without data loss

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must cover both small and large codebases (1MB to 10GB)
- Compatibility tests must include all supported programming languages and version control systems
- Integration tests must verify correct operation on all supported operating systems

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation of DevBackup will meet these criteria:

1. **Efficiency Metrics**
