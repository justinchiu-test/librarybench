# MediBackup - Healthcare-Compliant Server Backup System

## Overview
MediBackup is a specialized incremental backup system designed for healthcare IT environments that require high reliability, application consistency, minimal performance impact, and compliance with patient data regulations. The system provides automated error handling, resource throttling, multi-tier security, and recovery time testing capabilities focused on maintaining the integrity of critical healthcare systems.

## Persona Description
Raj manages servers for a regional healthcare provider that must maintain patient records securely. He needs an automated, reliable backup system that guarantees data integrity and accessibility while minimizing system impact.

## Key Requirements

1. **Application-Consistent Backup Hooks**
   - Implement pre/post backup hooks for databases and stateful services
   - Create quiescing mechanisms for major database systems (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Support transaction log management and consistency points
   - Enable application-specific validation of backup integrity
   - This feature is critical for Raj as it ensures that database backups are transactionally consistent and recoverable, preventing data corruption that could impact patient care by allowing clean restoration of healthcare applications

2. **Resource Throttling System**
   - Develop dynamic resource usage monitoring and limitation
   - Implement adjustable throttling based on system load and time of day
   - Create I/O priority management to minimize impact on critical services
   - Support for scheduled throttling profiles
   - Resource management is essential as it allows backups to run without negatively affecting the performance of healthcare systems that may be in use 24/7 for patient care, ensuring clinical applications remain responsive

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Design sophisticated error detection and classification
   - Implement automated retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Create escalation procedures with configurable notification channels
   - Support for partial success handling and resumable operations
   - Robust error handling ensures that backup failures are properly managed, as Raj's healthcare environment cannot tolerate data loss or undetected backup failures that could compromise patient data availability

4. **Multi-Tier Backup Strategy**
   - Implement data classification based on sensitivity and importance
   - Create policy-based routing to appropriate storage tiers
   - Support for different retention and encryption policies by tier
   - Enable compliance validation for protected health information
   - This tiered approach is vital for properly securing different types of healthcare data according to regulatory requirements while optimizing storage costs and ensuring appropriate protection levels for patient information

5. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) Testing**
   - Develop automated recovery simulation capabilities
   - Implement performance measurement for restoration operations
   - Create comparative analysis against defined RTO requirements
   - Support scheduled validation of recovery procedures
   - RTO testing is crucial as it verifies that systems can be restored within the timeframes required by the healthcare organization's disaster recovery plan, ensuring continuity of patient care in emergency situations

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All application hooks must be testable with simulated database environments
- Throttling mechanisms must be verifiable under controlled load conditions
- Error handling must be tested across a comprehensive range of failure scenarios
- Tier-based routing must be validated with representative data samples
- RTO testing must be automatable without impacting production environments

### Performance Expectations
- Backup operations must have less than a 10% impact on application performance
- System must handle databases up to 5TB with minimal downtime for consistency
- Error detection and initial retry should occur within 30 seconds of a failure
- Tier classification should process 10GB of data per minute
- RTO testing should accurately measure recovery times within 5% margin of error

### Integration Points
- Database systems (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Healthcare applications with custom APIs
- Storage systems across multiple tiers
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Compliance auditing systems

### Key Constraints
- Must comply with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, HITECH, etc.)
- All operations must maintain detailed audit logs for compliance
- System must function within strict security boundaries
- Patient data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit
- Recovery operations must be testable without exposing sensitive data

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core capabilities:

1. **Application Consistency Engine**
   - Database-specific quiescing mechanisms
   - Transaction log management
   - Consistency point creation
   - Application state verification

2. **Resource Management**
   - System load monitoring
   - Dynamic throttling implementation
   - I/O prioritization
   - Scheduling and policy enforcement

3. **Error Recovery Framework**
   - Failure detection and classification
   - Retry strategy implementation
   - Notification and escalation system
   - Resumable operation handling

4. **Data Classification and Routing**
   - Content analysis and categorization
   - Policy definition and enforcement
   - Tier-specific processing pipelines
   - Compliance verification

5. **Recovery Validation**
   - Automated recovery environment provisioning
   - Performance measurement instrumentation
   - Comparative analysis against RTO requirements
   - Reporting and improvement recommendation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Successful creation of application-consistent backups across database types
- Proper resource throttling under various system load conditions
- Effective error detection and recovery for different failure scenarios
- Correct classification and routing of data to appropriate storage tiers
- Accurate measurement of recovery times against defined objectives

### Critical User Scenarios
- Nightly backup of mission-critical patient record database
- Backup during peak hospital system usage hours
- Recovery from backup after storage subsystem failure
- Handling of protected health information requiring special security
- Validation that critical systems can be restored within defined timeframes

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete application-consistent backup of 1TB database within 4-hour window
- Maintain application performance impact below 10% during backup operations
- Detect and begin recovery from errors within 30 seconds
- Process and classify 50GB of mixed healthcare data in under 15 minutes
- Complete recovery testing of critical systems within defined RTO (typically 1-4 hours)

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Backup during unexpected peak system load
- Database corruption requiring consistency validation
- Network interruptions during backup transfer
- Incomplete or corrupted backup sets
- Storage tier failure requiring rerouting
- Recovery with missing or damaged backup components

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% coverage of application consistency mechanisms
- 95% coverage of resource throttling components
- 100% coverage of error handling pathways
- 95% coverage of data classification and routing
- 90% coverage of recovery testing functionality

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
