# Interactive Data Explorer for Manufacturing Process Optimization

## Overview
A specialized variant of the Interactive Data Explorer tailored for manufacturing process engineers analyzing sensor data from production equipment. This tool emphasizes machine state visualization, defect correlation, performance benchmarking, and efficiency calculations to optimize manufacturing operations and product quality.

## Persona Description
Hiroshi optimizes production lines by analyzing sensor data from manufacturing equipment. He needs to identify quality issues and efficiency bottlenecks through pattern recognition in multivariate time-series data from the factory floor.

## Key Requirements

1. **Machine State Transition Visualization**
   - Implement specialized visualizations showing operational mode changes and state transitions over time
   - Critical because manufacturing equipment cycles through different operational states, and transitions often reveal optimization opportunities
   - Must support multiple machine states with configurable definitions and thresholds
   - Should highlight abnormal state sequences and transition patterns that correlate with quality or efficiency issues

2. **Defect Correlation Mapping**
   - Create analytical tools that identify connections between quality issues and specific process parameters
   - Essential for root cause analysis of manufacturing defects by correlating defect rates with machine settings, environmental conditions, and material properties
   - Must handle complex multivariate relationships across hundreds of process parameters
   - Should prioritize correlations based on statistical significance and actionability

3. **Shift Comparison Views**
   - Develop comparative analysis tools highlighting performance differences between production crews, shifts, and schedules
   - Important because variation between work periods often indicates process control issues, training gaps, or resource allocation problems
   - Must normalize for legitimate factors (e.g., product mix, scheduled maintenance) to ensure fair comparisons
   - Should identify specific parameters with significant crew-dependent variation

4. **Production Efficiency Calculators**
   - Implement customizable OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) formulas and other manufacturing KPI calculations
   - Critical because manufacturing optimization requires standardized metrics that combine availability, performance, and quality factors
   - Must support industry-standard efficiency metrics with customizable parameters
   - Should provide hierarchical aggregation from individual machines to production lines to plant-wide metrics

5. **Real-time Monitoring Integration**
   - Create a framework for streaming and analyzing live data from factory systems
   - Essential for detecting and responding to developing issues before they impact production
   - Must handle high-frequency sensor data with minimal latency
   - Should support both historical comparison and real-time anomaly detection
