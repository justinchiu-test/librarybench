# Interactive Data Explorer for Network Security Analysis

## Overview
A specialized variant of the Interactive Data Explorer tailored for network security analysts monitoring enterprise traffic patterns to detect threats. This tool emphasizes traffic visualization, protocol analysis, entity resolution, threat correlation, and alert prioritization to identify and respond to security incidents.

## Persona Description
Omar monitors enterprise network traffic patterns to detect potential security threats. He needs to quickly identify anomalous behavior in large volumes of connection logs and packet metadata without transferring sensitive data to external systems.

## Key Requirements

1. **Traffic Pattern Heatmaps**
   - Implement specialized visualizations mapping connection volumes across IP space and time
   - Critical because unusual traffic patterns are often the first indicator of compromised systems or attack attempts
   - Must visualize network traffic across multiple dimensions (source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, volumes)
   - Should highlight deviations from baseline patterns with configurable sensitivity thresholds

2. **Protocol Deviation Highlighting**
   - Create analysis tools that identify unusual application behaviors and protocol anomalies
   - Essential for detecting sophisticated attacks that operate within allowed connection paths but exhibit unusual patterns
   - Must model expected protocol behavior and flag deviations in payload characteristics, timing, or sequence
   - Should classify anomalies by type and severity with context-aware thresholds

3. **Entity Resolution**
   - Develop systems to link disparate network identifiers to specific devices and users
   - Important for tracking potentially compromised assets across different network segments and time periods
   - Must correlate various identifiers (MAC addresses, IPs, hostnames, credentials) into coherent entity profiles
   - Should handle dynamic addressing and device mobility while maintaining entity continuity

4. **Threat Signature Correlation**
   - Implement pattern matching to compare activity patterns against known attack vectors
   - Critical for rapidly identifying recognized threat techniques and associating disparate activities with known attack campaigns
   - Must efficiently match observed patterns against thousands of known threat signatures
   - Should identify partial matches and potential variants of known threats

5. **Alert Triage Prioritization**
   - Create intelligent ranking of security anomalies based on potential impact
   - Essential for focusing analyst attention on the most critical issues in high-volume security monitoring environments
   - Must consider factors including asset value, anomaly severity, and attack stage to prioritize alerts
   - Should reduce false positives through contextual filtering and correlation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable via pytest with reproducible results
- Detection algorithms must be validated against labeled security datasets
- Visualization methods must have quantifiable accuracy metrics
- Entity resolution must demonstrate provable accuracy with dynamic network identities
- Alert prioritization must show measurable improvement over baseline methods

### Performance Expectations
- Must process network logs at rates of 10,000+ events per second
- Visualization should render traffic patterns from millions of connections interactively
- Entity resolution should maintain consistency across billions of events
- Threat correlation must match patterns against thousands of signatures with minimal latency
- All critical security functions must complete with sub-second response times

### Integration Points
- Data import from common network monitoring systems and security tools
- Support for standard network data formats (PCAP, Netflow, syslog, IPFIX)
- Integration with threat intelligence platforms and signature databases
- Export capabilities for security incident documentation
- Optional integration with security orchestration systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate entirely on-premises without external data transfers
- Should minimize memory and storage footprints for long-term monitoring
- Must handle encrypted traffic patterns without requiring decryption
- Should operate effectively with incomplete and fragmented network data
- Must maintain chain of custody for potential security incidents

## Core Functionality

The implementation must provide the following core capabilities:

1. **Network Traffic Analysis**
   - Processing of high-volume connection logs and network metadata
   - Baseline modeling of normal traffic patterns for different network segments
   - Anomaly detection across multiple traffic dimensions
   - Temporal correlation of related network events
   - Contextual interpretation of traffic patterns based on network topology

2. **Protocol Behavior Modeling**
   - Application protocol fingerprinting and classification
   - Statistical modeling of expected protocol behavior
   - Anomaly detection for unusual protocol usage
   - Deep packet metadata analysis without content inspection
   - Protocol state tracking for multi-stage interactions

3. **Network Entity Management**
   - Identity correlation across different network identifiers
   - Temporal tracking of entity behavior and location
   - Asset classification and importance ranking
   - Relationship mapping between entities
   - Activity profiling for different entity types

4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - Pattern matching against known threat signatures
   - Tactical correlation of multiple related security events
   - Campaign tracking across extended time periods
   - Attribution analysis for threat actors
   - Continual updates to detection patterns

5. **Security Alert Management**
   - Multi-factor alert scoring and prioritization
   - False positive reduction through contextual analysis
   - Related alert grouping and incident formation
   - Historical context for recurring patterns
   - Evidence collection for security incidents

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must be thoroughly tested with:

1. **Traffic Analysis Tests**
   - Validation of pattern detection against labeled traffic datasets
   - Testing with simulated attack patterns in background traffic
   - Performance testing with high-volume traffic logs
   - Verification of baseline modeling accuracy
   - Edge case testing for unusual network configurations

2. **Protocol Analysis Tests**
   - Validation of protocol identification accuracy
   - Testing with protocol violations of varying subtlety

   - Testing with malformed and non-compliant protocol implementations

3. **Entity Resolution Tests**
   - Validation of identity correlation accuracy
   - Testing with dynamic addressing scenarios

   - Edge case testing for ambiguous identity scenarios

4. **Threat Correlation Tests**
   - Validation of signature matching accuracy
   - Testing with variant attack patterns
   - Performance testing with large signature databases
   - Verification of partial match identification
   - Testing of attribution analysis capabilities

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when it:

1. Accurately visualizes network traffic patterns highlighting security-relevant anomalies
2. Effectively identifies protocol deviations that indicate potential attacks
3. Consistently resolves network identifiers to maintain entity continuity
4. Reliably correlates observed activity with known threat patterns
5. Intelligently prioritizes alerts to focus attention on the most critical issues
6. Processes enterprise-scale network data with acceptable performance
7. Operates securely without exposing sensitive data
8. Reduces false positives while maintaining high detection sensitivity
9. Facilitates rapid incident response through clear evidence presentation
10. Adapts to evolving network conditions and threat landscapes

IMPORTANT: 
- Implementation must be in Python
- All functionality must be testable via pytest
- There should be NO user interface components
- Design code as libraries and APIs rather than applications with UIs
- The implementation should be focused solely on the network security analyst's requirements
