# Network Traffic Security Analysis Explorer

A specialized interactive data exploration framework tailored for network security analysts to detect potential security threats through analysis of connection logs and packet metadata.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis library for network security analysts to monitor, visualize, and identify anomalous behavior in enterprise network traffic. The Network Traffic Security Analysis Explorer enables security professionals to quickly process large volumes of connection logs and packet metadata, visualize traffic patterns, identify protocol deviations, link network identifiers to specific entities, correlate activities with known threat signatures, and prioritize security alertsâ€”all without transferring sensitive data to external systems.

## Persona Description

Omar monitors enterprise network traffic patterns to detect potential security threats. He needs to quickly identify anomalous behavior in large volumes of connection logs and packet metadata without transferring sensitive data to external systems.

## Key Requirements

1. **Traffic Pattern Heatmaps**
   - Implement visualization algorithms for connection volumes across IP space and time
   - Critical for identifying unusual traffic patterns that may indicate security incidents
   - Must handle IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces with appropriate subnet-aware aggregation
   - Enables security analysts to quickly spot traffic anomalies that might be missed in textual logs

2. **Protocol Deviation Highlighting**
   - Create analytical methods for identifying unusual application behaviors
   - Essential for detecting non-standard protocol usage that may indicate malware or exfiltration
   - Must analyze both header information and payload statistics when available
   - Allows analysts to detect sophisticated attacks that operate within legitimate protocols but use them in unusual ways

3. **Entity Resolution**
   - Develop correlation techniques for linking disparate network identifiers to specific devices and users
   - Vital for maintaining a coherent security picture across dynamic addressing schemes
   - Must reconcile identifiers across different protocols, time periods, and network segments
   - Helps security teams track potentially malicious actors across network boundaries and identifier changes

4. **Threat Signature Correlation**
   - Implement pattern-matching algorithms to compare activity patterns against known attack vectors
   - Important for recognizing attack sequences and techniques used by known threat actors
   - Must support both exact and fuzzy matching against signature databases
   - Enables rapid identification of attacks that match established threat intelligence

5. **Alert Triage Prioritization**
   - Create risk assessment systems for ranking anomalies by potential security impact
   - Critical for focusing limited analyst resources on the most significant potential threats
   - Must consider asset value, vulnerability context, and threat intelligence
   - Allows security teams to address the most significant risks first in high-volume alert environments

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All detection algorithms must be verifiable against packet captures containing known attack patterns
- Statistical analyses must produce consistent results with identical inputs
- Performance metrics must be measurable through automated testing frameworks
- False positive/negative rates must be quantifiable against labeled test datasets
- Alert prioritization must be testable against scenarios with established risk rankings

### Performance Expectations
- Must efficiently process network traffic data volumes of at least 1TB per day
- Pattern analysis operations should complete in under 30 seconds for typical daily traffic summaries
- Real-time monitoring functions should process at least 10,000 connections per second
- Memory usage should be optimized for continuous operation on standard security workstations
- Visualization generation should complete in under 5 seconds for interactive analysis

### Integration Points
- Data import capabilities for common security log formats (Syslog, PCAP, NetFlow, Zeek/Bro, etc.)
- Support for ingesting threat intelligence in standard formats (STIX, TAXII, OpenIOC, etc.)
- Export interfaces for sharing findings with other security tools
- Optional integration with SIEM systems for alert correlation
- Support for asset and vulnerability management data to inform risk assessment

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with Python's standard library and minimal external dependencies
- No user interface components; focus on API and programmatic interfaces
- All processing must occur locally without transmitting sensitive data externally
- Must handle datasets with potentially sensitive security information
- All analysis must be reproducible with identical inputs producing identical results

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Network Traffic Security Analysis Explorer should provide a cohesive set of Python modules that enable:

1. **Network Traffic Data Processing**
   - Efficient parsing and normalization of various network traffic log formats
   - Feature extraction from connection metadata and packet information
   - Aggregation and summarization across various dimensions (time, address space, protocol)
   - Statistical baseline calculation for establishing normal network behavior patterns

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Statistical outlier detection for traffic volumes and connection patterns
   - Protocol conformance checking against standard implementations
   - Behavioral analysis to identify unusual activity patterns
   - Time-series anomaly detection for identifying deviations from historical patterns

3. **Entity Tracking and Correlation**
   - Mapping between IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, and user identities
   - Temporal tracking of entity behavior across identifier changes
   - Relationship mapping between communicating entities
   - Behavioral profiling of network entities based on historical activity

4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - Matching observed activities against known threat indicators
   - Risk scoring based on threat intelligence context
   - Attack pattern recognition across multiple events and entities
   - Campaign tracking for related security events

5. **Security Alert Management**
   - Risk-based prioritization of security events
   - Contextual enrichment of alerts with relevant network and asset information
   - Aggregation of related alerts into security incidents
   - False positive reduction through correlation and context

## Testing Requirements
