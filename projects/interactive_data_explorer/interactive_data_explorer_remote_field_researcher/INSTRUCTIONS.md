# Interactive Data Explorer for Remote Field Research

## Overview
A specialized variant of the Interactive Data Explorer tailored for ecological researchers operating in remote wilderness locations with limited power and connectivity. This tool emphasizes energy efficiency, offline operation, and integration with environmental sensor data while supporting the unique constraints of field research environments.

## Persona Description
Marco conducts ecological studies in remote wilderness locations with limited connectivity and computing resources. He needs to analyze environmental sensor data collected during expeditions using only his laptop without relying on cloud services or specialized hardware.

## Key Requirements

1. **Low-power Operating Mode**
   - Implement adaptive computational scaling that optimizes battery life during extended field sessions
   - Critical because field researchers often work for days without reliable power sources
   - Must provide configurable performance levels to balance analytical depth against power consumption
   - Needs to monitor and report estimated battery impact of different operations

2. **Geospatial Visualization with Custom Coordinate Systems**
   - Create specialized mapping capabilities with support for custom coordinate systems specific to study regions
   - Essential because ecological research often occurs in areas poorly represented by standard mapping systems
   - Must handle arbitrary coordinate transformations for specialized ecological transects
   - Should support overlay of environmental parameters on custom spatial representations

3. **Offline Reference Dataset Integration**
   - Implement a system for packaging, versioning, and comparing field data with pre-loaded historical environmental records
   - Important because comparisons to baseline conditions are often critical for identifying ecological changes
   - Must operate without any network connectivity while maintaining data integrity
   - Should optimize storage utilization for reference datasets to fit within limited field device capacity

4. **Sensor Calibration Tools**
   - Develop algorithms that identify and correct for environmental interference patterns in sensor readings
   - Critical because field sensor data is often affected by environmental conditions that must be compensated for
   - Must detect common sensor issues like temperature drift, humidity effects, and power fluctuations
   - Should provide audit trails for all calibration adjustments made to raw sensor data

5. **Expedition Context Annotations**
   - Create a framework for linking quantitative data anomalies with qualitative field notes and observations
   - Essential for capturing the full context of field research where measured data alone may miss important environmental factors
   - Must support structured and freeform annotation at multiple levels of granularity
   - Should provide bidirectional navigation between annotations and corresponding data points

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements

- All operations should include power impact estimates before execution

### Integration Points
- Data import from common environmental sensor formats
