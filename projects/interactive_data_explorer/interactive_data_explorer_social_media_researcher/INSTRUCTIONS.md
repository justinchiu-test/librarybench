# Interactive Data Explorer for Social Media Research

## Overview
A specialized variant of the Interactive Data Explorer tailored for social media researchers analyzing conversation networks and content trends. This tool emphasizes network graph visualization, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, influence tracing, and demographic clustering to study digital social interactions.

## Persona Description
Dr. Rivera studies social interaction patterns across digital platforms. She needs to explore conversation networks and content trends while identifying community structures and influence patterns in large-scale social data.

## Key Requirements

1. **Network Graph Visualization with Community Detection**
   - Implement specialized network visualization with algorithms that identify and highlight community structures
   - Critical because understanding social groupings and their interconnections is fundamental to social media research
   - Must handle large-scale networks with tens of thousands of nodes and edges
   - Should apply multiple community detection algorithms (modularity-based, clique-based, etc.) with configurable parameters

2. **Sentiment Analysis Overlays**
   - Create sentiment analysis tools that map emotional tones across different user groups and conversations
   - Essential for understanding emotional context and reactions within social interactions
   - Must support multiple sentiment classification methods with customizable lexicons and models
   - Should visualize sentiment dynamics over time and across different community segments

3. **Topic Modeling Tools**
   - Develop natural language processing capabilities to identify conversation themes and track their evolution
   - Important for discovering what subjects engage different communities and how these topics change over time
   - Must implement standard topic modeling approaches (LDA, NMF) with customizable parameters
   - Should visualize topic prevalence, relationships, and temporal shifts across conversations

4. **Influence Flow Visualization**
   - Create specialized analytics to trace how ideas propagate through social networks
   - Critical for understanding information diffusion and identifying key influencers
   - Must track content sharing patterns, attribution chains, and temporal spread
   - Should identify and characterize different influence mechanisms (broadcasting, viral spread, etc.)

5. **Demographic Clustering**
   - Implement tools that identify distinct user groups based on behavioral patterns
   - Essential for segmenting users based on interaction styles, content preferences, and platform usage
   - Must operate on behavioral signals without requiring explicit demographic data
   - Should provide interpretable cluster characteristics for research insights

## Technical Requirements
