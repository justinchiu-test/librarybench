# Social Network Interaction Analysis Explorer

A specialized interactive data exploration framework tailored for social media researchers to study conversation networks, content trends, and influence patterns across digital platforms.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis library for social media researchers to explore, visualize, and analyze social interaction patterns across digital platforms. The Social Network Interaction Analysis Explorer enables researchers to visualize conversation networks, detect community structures, analyze sentiment patterns, identify emerging topics, and trace influence flows within large-scale social data.

## Persona Description

Dr. Rivera studies social interaction patterns across digital platforms. She needs to explore conversation networks and content trends while identifying community structures and influence patterns in large-scale social data.

## Key Requirements

1. **Network Graph Visualization with Community Detection**
   - Implement graph analysis algorithms for identifying social connections and community structures
   - Essential for understanding relationship patterns and group formations in social networks
   - Must handle large-scale networks with millions of nodes and connections
   - Enables researchers to visualize the structure of social communities and identify key connectors between groups

2. **Sentiment Analysis Overlays**
   - Create natural language processing capabilities to show emotional tones across different user groups
   - Critical for understanding emotional dynamics and reactions across different communities
   - Must support multiple sentiment models and lexicons for different contexts and languages
   - Allows researchers to map emotional landscapes and contrast sentiment patterns between communities

3. **Topic Modeling Tools**
   - Develop text analysis functionality to identify conversation themes and their evolution over time
   - Vital for tracking discourse patterns and subject matter trends in social communications
   - Must handle multilingual content and specialized vocabulary across different platforms
   - Helps researchers understand what communities are discussing and how topics spread and evolve

4. **Influence Flow Visualization**
   - Implement algorithmic techniques for tracing how ideas propagate through social networks
   - Important for identifying opinion leaders and understanding information diffusion patterns
   - Must track concept propagation across time, platforms, and community boundaries
   - Enables researchers to study how information spreads and which network structures facilitate propagation

5. **Demographic Clustering**
   - Create statistical methods for identifying distinct user groups based on behavior patterns
   - Critical for segmenting network participants into meaningful behavioral categories
   - Must work with limited demographic information while respecting privacy constraints
   - Helps researchers identify and characterize different user types within larger social networks

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All network analysis algorithms must be verifiable against synthetic networks with known properties
- Sentiment analysis must be benchmarkable against standard sentiment datasets
- Topic modeling must produce consistent results given the same inputs
- Influence detection algorithms must correctly identify known patterns in test networks
- Clustering mechanisms must reliably group similar profiles in test datasets

### Performance Expectations
- Must efficiently handle social network datasets with millions of users and interactions
- Graph algorithms should scale sub-quadratically with network size
- Text processing operations should handle hundreds of thousands of documents efficiently
- Temporal analysis should manage longitudinal data spanning years of interactions
- Memory usage should be optimized for processing large network datasets on standard research workstations

### Integration Points
- Data import capabilities for common social media platform exports and API data formats
- Support for standard network exchange formats (GEXF, GraphML, edge lists, etc.)
- Compatibility with common text corpora and NLP pipeline outputs
- Export interfaces for further analysis in specialized statistical tools
- Integration with established NLP libraries for text processing functions

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with Python's standard library and minimal external dependencies
- No user interface components; focus on API and programmatic interfaces
- All operations must maintain privacy and ethical handling of social data
- Must handle inconsistent, missing, and biased data common in social media research
- Text processing must be language-agnostic where possible and language-aware where necessary

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Social Network Interaction Analysis Explorer should provide a cohesive set of Python modules that enable:

1. **Social Network Analysis**
   - Construction and manipulation of social network graphs from interaction data
   - Community detection using multiple algorithms (modularity, clique, centrality-based)
   - Identification of key network positions (bridges, hubs, authorities, gatekeepers)
   - Calculation of network metrics at global, community, and individual levels

2. **Text and Sentiment Analysis**
   - Processing of social media text to extract sentiment scores and emotional dimensions
   - Mapping sentiment patterns across network structures and time
   - Comparison of sentiment distributions between communities and topics
   - Identification of sentiment shifts and emotional reactions to events

3. **Conversation Topic Analysis**
   - Topic extraction from conversation text using various models (LDA, NMF, BERT-based)
   - Tracking of topic prevalence and evolution over time
   - Association of topics with communities and user groups
   - Detection of emerging topics and declining conversations

4. **Information Propagation Analysis**
   - Tracing of content sharing and idea propagation across network structures
   - Identification of initial sources and key amplifiers in information spread
   - Measurement of propagation speed, reach, and penetration across communities
   - Prediction of potential virality based on early propagation patterns

5. **User Behavior Clustering**
   - Feature extraction from user activity patterns, content, and network position
   - Application of clustering algorithms to identify distinct behavioral groups
   - Profiling of cluster characteristics and behavioral signatures
   - Tracking of user movement between behavioral clusters over time

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate detection of community structures in social networks
- Correct sentiment analysis across different text types and contexts
- Proper topic identification and tracking over time
- Accurate tracing of influence and information propagation
- Effective clustering of users into behaviorally distinct groups

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing a political discussion network to identify ideological communities
- Mapping sentiment reactions to a viral event across different user groups
- Tracking the emergence and evolution of conversation topics during a crisis
- Tracing the spread of a meme or hashtag through a social network
- Identifying distinct user behavior patterns in a cross-platform dataset

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete community detection on a network with 100,000 nodes in under 2 minutes
- Process sentiment analysis on 50,000 social media posts in under 1 minute

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Graceful handling of disconnected or highly fragmented networks

- Comprehensive test cases for information propagation tracing

- Performance tests for all computationally intensive operations

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
