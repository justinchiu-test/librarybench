# Urban Transit Flow Analysis Explorer

A specialized interactive data exploration framework tailored for urban transportation planners to optimize public transit routes and schedules based on passenger demand patterns.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis library for urban transportation planners to visualize, analyze, and optimize public transit networks. The Urban Transit Flow Analysis Explorer enables planners to visualize passenger movements, identify underserved areas, model temporal demand patterns, simulate route modifications, map accessibility across demographics, and analyze connection efficiency between different transportation modes.

## Persona Description

Aisha analyzes city transportation data to optimize public transit routes and schedules. She needs to visualize passenger flow, identify underserved areas, and model the impact of potential service changes on commuter patterns.

## Key Requirements

1. **Geospatial Flow Visualization**
   - Implement visualization algorithms for showing passenger movement through transit networks
   - Critical for understanding actual usage patterns across the transit system
   - Must handle complex urban transit networks with multiple routes, stops, and transfer points
   - Enables planners to identify high-traffic corridors and underutilized segments

2. **Temporal Demand Modeling**
   - Create analytical tools for identifying peak usage patterns and service gaps
   - Essential for aligning transit capacity with actual demand throughout the day
   - Must model variations across days of week, seasons, and special events
   - Allows transit planners to optimize schedules based on when passengers actually need service

3. **Route Optimization Simulation**
   - Develop simulation capabilities for testing schedule modifications against historical demand
   - Vital for predicting the impact of proposed changes before implementation
   - Must account for passenger behavior factors like route preference and transfer willingness
   - Helps validate proposed service changes against actual passenger needs and behaviors

4. **Accessibility Mapping**
   - Implement analysis tools for showing transit coverage across different demographics
   - Important for ensuring equitable service distribution and identifying underserved populations
   - Must integrate with demographic data and account for physical accessibility constraints
   - Enables planners to evaluate transit equity and service coverage for all community members

5. **Multimodal Transfer Analysis**
   - Create tools for highlighting connection efficiency between transportation types
   - Critical for optimizing transfers between buses, trains, bikeshare, and other modes
   - Must account for physical transfer distances, timing alignment, and service reliability
   - Allows planners to improve the overall passenger experience across the complete journey

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All routing and scheduling algorithms must be verifiable against known test networks
- Demand modeling must be validated against historical ridership data
- Simulation results must be reproducible with identical inputs
- Accessibility calculations must be testable against established transit coverage metrics
- Transfer analysis must be verifiable using standard connection efficiency measures

### Performance Expectations
- Must efficiently handle transit networks with thousands of stops and hundreds of routes
- Demand modeling should process historical data covering at least one year in under a minute
- Route simulations should complete in under 10 seconds for typical network modifications
- Accessibility calculations should handle city-scale demographic data efficiently
- Visualization generation should complete in under 5 seconds for interactive analysis

### Integration Points
- Data import capabilities for common transit data formats (GTFS, GTFS-RT, AVL, APC)
- Support for geospatial data standards (GeoJSON, Shapefile, etc.)
- Compatibility with demographic data sources (Census, ACS, etc.)
- Export interfaces for sharing findings with stakeholders and other planning tools
- Optional integration with OpenStreetMap and other public infrastructure datasets

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with Python's standard library and minimal external dependencies
- No user interface components; focus on API and programmatic interfaces
- Must handle potentially sensitive ridership and demographic information appropriately
- All analysis must be reproducible with identical inputs producing identical results
- Algorithms must be efficient enough to run on standard planning department hardware

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Urban Transit Flow Analysis Explorer should provide a cohesive set of Python modules that enable:

1. **Transit Network Analysis**
   - Loading and processing transit network topology from standard formats
   - Calculating network metrics like coverage, connectivity, and directness
   - Identifying critical nodes and segments in the transit network
   - Comparing network efficiency across different transit systems

2. **Passenger Flow Analysis**
   - Processing origin-destination data to understand movement patterns
   - Estimating passenger loads along routes and at stations
   - Identifying primary corridors and underutilized segments
   - Detecting recurring congestion and capacity issues

3. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyzing ridership variations across different time periods
   - Identifying peak demand periods and service gaps
   - Predicting demand based on historical patterns and external factors
   - Optimizing schedule frequency to match actual demand patterns

4. **Service Equity and Accessibility**
   - Calculating transit access across different geographic and demographic segments
   - Mapping service gaps for vulnerable populations
   - Identifying areas with inadequate service relative to need
   - Evaluating compliance with equity requirements and standards

5. **Multimodal Integration**
   - Analyzing transfer points between different transit modes
   - Optimizing connection timing to minimize passenger wait times
   - Evaluating first/last mile connectivity issues
   - Simulating the impact of new mobility options on existing transit

## Testing Requirements

- Accurate representation of passenger flows through transit networks
- Correct identification of temporal demand patterns from ridership data
- Proper simulation of route modifications and their impact on service
- Accurate mapping of transit accessibility across geographic and demographic dimensions
- Effective analysis of transfer efficiency between transportation modes

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing passenger flows during peak commute hours to identify congestion
- Identifying underserved neighborhoods based on demographic and transit data
- Simulating the impact of a new bus route on overall system connectivity
- Evaluating service equity across different socioeconomic populations
- Optimizing transfer points between rail, bus, and micromobility options

### Performance Benchmarks

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Graceful handling of incomplete or inconsistent transit schedule data

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
