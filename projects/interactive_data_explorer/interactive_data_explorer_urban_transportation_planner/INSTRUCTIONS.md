# Interactive Data Explorer for Urban Transportation Planning

## Overview
A specialized variant of the Interactive Data Explorer tailored for transportation planners analyzing urban mobility patterns to optimize public transit. This tool emphasizes geospatial flow visualization, temporal demand modeling, route optimization, accessibility analysis, and transfer efficiency to improve city transportation networks.

## Persona Description

   - Essential for understanding when and where transit demand occurs throughout the day, week, and year
   - Must detect recurring patterns, seasonal variations, and anomalous demand events
   - Should project future demand based on historical patterns and growth trends

3. **Route Optimization Simulation**
   - Develop simulation capabilities for testing schedule modifications against historical demand
   - Important for predicting the impact of service changes before implementation
   - Must model passenger behavior including route choice, transfers, and walking distances
