# Accessible Documentation Compliance System

## Overview
The Accessible Documentation Compliance System is a specialized documentation tool designed for accessibility compliance officers who ensure documentation meets standards for users with disabilities. It provides automated accessibility checking, screen reader simulation, alternative format generation, color contrast analysis, and keyboard navigation optimization - helping organizations create fully accessible technical documentation that can be used effectively by all users regardless of their abilities.

## Persona Description
Raj ensures that all company documentation meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities. He needs to identify and remediate accessibility issues while providing alternative content formats where necessary.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automated Accessibility Compliance Checking**
   - Analyze documentation against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards
   - Critical for Raj because manual checking of large documentation sets is time-consuming and error-prone
   - Must validate against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria at minimum
   - Should provide detailed reports of violations with remediation suggestions
   - Must support customizable compliance rules for organization-specific requirements
   - Should track compliance improvement over time

2. **Screen Reader Simulation**
   - Preview how documentation will be experienced by visually impaired users using screen readers
   - Essential for Raj to understand the actual user experience for blind or low-vision users
   - Must generate audio representation of documentation content
   - Should identify navigation issues specific to screen reader users
   - Must validate proper heading structure and reading order
   - Should analyze effectiveness of alt text and other non-visual cues

3. **Alternative Format Generation**
   - Create accessible alternative versions of documentation including audio formats
   - Vital for Raj to provide equivalent access to content for users with different abilities
   - Must convert documentation to audio files with proper pacing and pronunciation
   - Should preserve document structure in alternative formats
   - Must generate properly tagged PDF versions that are screen-reader friendly
   - Should support customizable output parameters (voice, speed, etc.)

4. **Color Contrast Analysis**
   - Analyze documentation for sufficient contrast between text and background colors
   - Critical for Raj to ensure readability for users with visual impairments or color blindness
   - Must validate against WCAG contrast ratio requirements
   - Should simulate how content appears to users with different forms of color blindness
   - Must identify all contrast issues in text, charts, diagrams, and UI elements
   - Should suggest alternative color schemes that meet requirements

5. **Keyboard Navigation Optimization**
   - Ensure documentation can be fully navigated without a mouse or other pointing device
   - Essential for Raj because many users with motor disabilities rely exclusively on keyboard navigation
   - Must verify logical tab order and focus indicators
   - Should identify keyboard traps and unreachable content
   - Must test navigation across all interactive elements
   - Should measure keyboard efficiency (number of keystrokes needed for common tasks)

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have pytest test suites with at least 90% code coverage
- Accessibility validation must be tested against pre-scored documentation examples
- Screen reader simulation must be validated against actual screen reader output
- Alternative format generation must be tested for content accuracy and structure preservation
- Contrast analysis must be verified against WCAG standards
- Keyboard navigation must be tested with simulated keyboard-only user sessions

### Performance Expectations
- Accessibility checking must process 100 pages per minute
- Screen reader simulation must generate audio previews within 2x real-time reading speed
- Alternative format generation must process documentation at 50 pages per minute
- Contrast analysis must evaluate a typical documentation page in under 5 seconds
- Keyboard navigation testing must simulate complete user flows in under 30 seconds per flow

### Integration Points
- Documentation management systems for content access
- Compliance reporting systems for audit records
- Text-to-speech engines for audio generation
- Color management systems for contrast remediation
- Image analysis tools for visual content accessibility

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without a UI component
- The system must work with common documentation formats (HTML, Markdown, PDF, etc.)
- Audio generation must not rely on external web services for core functionality
- Color analysis must function with all standard color formats
- System must provide programmatic interfaces for integration with other tools

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Accessible Documentation Compliance System should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Content Accessibility Analysis**
   - Parse documentation to check structure and semantic markup
   - Validate content against WCAG success criteria
   - Identify patterns of accessibility issues
   - Generate detailed compliance reports

2. **Assistive Technology Simulation**
   - Model screen reader behavior on documentation content
   - Generate speech synthesis markup for content
   - Evaluate navigation paths and structure traversal
   - Identify content that may be misinterpreted by assistive technologies

3. **Format Transformation**
   - Convert documentation to alternative accessible formats
   - Generate audio versions with proper structure and navigation cues
   - Create properly tagged PDF documents
   - Preserve content relationships and hierarchy in all formats

4. **Visual Accessibility Evaluation**
   - Analyze text and background color combinations for contrast ratios
   - Simulate various forms of color vision deficiency
   - Evaluate visual indicators and cues for non-color dependence
   - Suggest accessible color alternatives

5. **Interaction Accessibility Testing**
   - Model keyboard-only navigation through documentation
   - Identify focus management issues
   - Evaluate interactive elements for keyboard accessibility
   - Measure navigation efficiency for common tasks

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate identification of WCAG compliance issues
- Realistic simulation of screen reader behavior
- Faithful conversion to alternative formats
- Precise measurement of color contrast ratios
- Comprehensive testing of keyboard navigation paths

### Critical User Scenarios
- A blind user accesses technical documentation with a screen reader
- A user with motor disabilities navigates documentation using only a keyboard
- A colorblind user reads diagrams and charts in technical documentation
- A user with cognitive disabilities navigates complex structured content
- A user with low vision relies on high contrast and scalable text

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete accessibility evaluation of 1000-page documentation set in under 2 hours
- Generate audio version of 100-page document in under 10 minutes
- Process 500 images for accessibility analysis in under 30 minutes
- Analyze color contrast of 100 diagrams in under 5 minutes
- Simulate keyboard navigation through 50 interactive documentation sections in under 15 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling documentation with complex interactive features
- Processing content with mixed languages and specialized terminology
- Managing highly technical content with complex equations or notations
- Evaluating documentation with complex visual data representations
- Addressing content that is inherently visual with no clear text alternative

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of WCAG validation rules
- Comprehensive tests for all supported document formats
- Performance tests for all operations at scale
- Accuracy tests comparing system results with expert evaluation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
