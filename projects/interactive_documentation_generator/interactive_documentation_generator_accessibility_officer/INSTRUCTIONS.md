# Accessibility-First Documentation Framework

## Overview
A comprehensive documentation system focused on accessibility compliance that automatically validates technical content against WCAG standards, simulates screen reader experiences, generates alternative formats, ensures proper color contrast, and optimizes keyboard navigation for users with disabilities.

## Persona Description
Raj ensures that all company documentation meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities. He needs to identify and remediate accessibility issues while providing alternative content formats where necessary.

## Key Requirements
1. **Automated Accessibility Compliance Checking** - Implement a system that analyzes documentation against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards, identifying issues and suggesting remediation steps. This is critical for Raj because it automates the time-consuming task of manual accessibility reviews, systematically identifies compliance gaps, and provides actionable guidance for fixing accessibility issues.

2. **Screen Reader Simulation** - Create functionality that simulates how documentation content will be experienced by visually impaired users relying on screen readers, including proper heading structure, alternative text, and reading order. This feature is essential because it helps Raj understand the actual user experience for visually impaired users, identifies navigation problems, and ensures content makes sense when consumed audibly rather than visually.

3. **Alternative Format Generation** - Develop capabilities to automatically transform documentation into accessible alternative formats, including audio versions, high-contrast versions, and simplified text versions. This capability is vital for Raj because it ensures documentation is available to users with different disabilities and preferences, meeting legal requirements for reasonable accommodation while reducing the manual effort required to create these alternatives.

4. **Color Contrast Analysis** - Implement tools to evaluate text and background color combinations throughout documentation, ensuring they meet WCAG contrast ratio requirements for users with various visual impairments. This is important for Raj because insufficient color contrast is one of the most common accessibility failures, and automated detection helps ensure readability for users with color blindness, low vision, or other visual limitations.

5. **Keyboard Navigation Optimization** - Design a system to analyze and enhance the keyboard navigability of interactive documentation elements, ensuring all functionality is accessible without a mouse. This is crucial for Raj because many users with motor disabilities rely entirely on keyboard navigation, and this feature helps ensure they can access all documentation functionality without barriers.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All WCAG compliance checks must be testable against documents with known accessibility issues
  - Screen reader simulation must produce consistent, verifiable output for test content
  - Alternative format generation must be validated against accessibility standards
  - Color contrast analysis must accurately identify combinations below WCAG thresholds
  - Keyboard navigation paths must be verifiable with automated testing

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Complete accessibility analysis for a 200-page document in under 5 minutes
  - Generate alternative formats at a rate of at least 1 page per second
  - Process color contrast analysis for complex documentation in under 2 minutes
  - Screen reader simulation should process content at a rate comparable to actual screen readers
  - System should handle documentation suites of 10,000+ pages efficiently

- **Integration Points**
  - Documentation authoring tools and content management systems
  - WCAG validation engines and accessibility testing frameworks
  - Audio generation services for alternative formats
  - Color analysis libraries and tools
  - Screen reader technology APIs for simulation validation

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must support multiple documentation formats (HTML, PDF, Markdown, etc.)
  - All accessibility evaluations must reference specific WCAG success criteria
  - Generated alternative formats must themselves be accessible
  - System must function without requiring specialized hardware
  - All operations must be automatable for integration into CI/CD pipelines

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a Python library with the following core modules:

1. **Accessibility Analyzer**: Evaluate documentation against WCAG standards and identify compliance issues.

2. **Screen Reader Emulator**: Process content to simulate how it would be interpreted by screen reading technology.

3. **Format Converter**: Transform documentation into various accessible alternative formats.

4. **Color Evaluator**: Analyze text and background color combinations for sufficient contrast.

5. **Keyboard Navigation Analyzer**: Evaluate and optimize keyboard accessibility for interactive elements.

6. **Remediation Advisor**: Generate specific recommendations to address identified accessibility issues.

7. **Compliance Reporter**: Create comprehensive accessibility compliance reports with remediation paths.

These modules should be designed with clean interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly while maintaining the ability to use individual components independently.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate identification of WCAG conformance failures
  - Correct simulation of screen reader behavior with different content types
  - Proper generation of alternative formats that maintain content integrity
  - Accurate calculation of color contrast ratios against WCAG thresholds
  - Correct analysis of keyboard navigation paths and identification of barriers

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Evaluating a new documentation set for accessibility compliance
  - Remediating identified accessibility issues in existing documentation
  - Generating alternative formats for users with specific disabilities
  - Ensuring documentation remains accessible after content updates
  - Preparing documentation for a formal accessibility audit

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Complete WCAG 2.1 AA compliance check on 500 pages in under 10 minutes
  - Generate audio versions of 100-page documentation in under 5 minutes
  - Process color contrast analysis for 1,000 content elements in under 2 minutes
  - Keyboard navigation analysis for complex interactive documentation in under 3 minutes
  - Handle batch processing of 50+ documents without performance degradation

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Complex interactive documentation elements with custom behaviors
  - Content with mathematical notation, diagrams, or specialized symbols
  - Documentation with embedded multimedia content requiring accessibility features
  - Dynamic content that changes based on user interactions
  - Non-standard documentation formats or structures
  - Content with intentional visual formatting that affects screen reader interpretation

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% line coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for WCAG success criteria evaluation logic
  - 95%+ coverage for color contrast calculation algorithms
  - 95%+ coverage for screen reader simulation core functionality
  - 90%+ coverage for alternative format generation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It correctly identifies 95%+ of accessibility issues based on WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. Screen reader simulation accurately reflects how actual screen readers process content
3. Alternative format generation creates usable, accessible versions in multiple formats
4. Color contrast analysis correctly identifies 100% of combinations that fall below WCAG thresholds
5. Keyboard navigation optimization successfully identifies and addresses barriers to keyboard access
6. The system provides clear, actionable remediation guidance for identified issues
7. All tests pass with the specified coverage metrics
8. The system functions without requiring a user interface while providing APIs for integration
