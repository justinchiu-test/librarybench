# Regulatory Documentation Compliance System

A specialized documentation platform that ensures financial software documentation meets regulatory requirements, provides audit trails, enforces legally precise terminology, and identifies compliance gaps.

## Overview

The Regulatory Documentation Compliance System enables compliance specialists to ensure technical documentation adheres to financial regulations. It maps documentation to specific regulatory requirements, maintains immutable documentation snapshots, enforces controlled terminology, analyzes compliance gaps, and monitors regulatory changes that affect documentation.

## Persona Description

Yasmin ensures that financial software documentation meets strict regulatory requirements. She needs to maintain auditable records of documentation changes and verify that all mandated disclosures and processes are properly documented.

## Key Requirements

1. **Regulatory Requirement Traceability** - The system must map documentation sections to specific regulations, standards, and compliance requirements. This is critical for Yasmin because during audits and examinations, she must demonstrate that every regulatory requirement has corresponding documentation, providing direct evidence of compliance with applicable financial regulations.

2. **Timestamped Documentation Snapshots** - The tool must generate and preserve immutable point-in-time documentation records that can be referenced during audits. As a compliance specialist, Yasmin needs this feature to provide auditors with irrefutable evidence of what documentation existed at specific points in time, especially for proving compliance during particular regulatory periods.

3. **Controlled Vocabulary Enforcement** - The system must ensure only approved, legally precise terminology is used throughout all documentation. This is essential for Yasmin because inconsistent or imprecise terminology in financial documentation can create legal ambiguity, regulatory violations, or misinterpretation of critical processes, potentially resulting in significant penalties.

4. **Compliance Gap Analysis** - The tool must automatically identify missing required disclosures, procedures, or regulatory content in documentation. This helps Yasmin proactively identify and address documentation deficiencies before they become audit findings or regulatory violations, reducing compliance risk for the organization.

5. **Regulatory Update Monitoring** - The system must track changes to relevant regulations and identify documentation sections impacted by regulatory updates. This feature is vital for Yasmin to ensure documentation remains compliant as regulations evolve, allowing her to prioritize updates to affected documentation based on regulatory change timelines.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with minimum 95% code coverage
- Traceability mapping must be verifiable with known regulatory frameworks
- Snapshot generation must be testable for immutability and timestamp accuracy
- Vocabulary enforcement must be verifiable with controlled term dictionaries
- Gap analysis must be testable with intentionally non-compliant documentation

### Performance Expectations
- Regulatory mapping must process 10,000+ page documentation sets in under 30 minutes
- Snapshot generation must complete in under 5 minutes for complete documentation sets
- Vocabulary scanning must process documents at a rate of at least 50 pages per second
- Gap analysis must complete in under 10 minutes for full regulatory frameworks
- Regulatory update impact analysis must complete in under 5 minutes

### Integration Points
- Regulatory content databases and APIs
- Document management and version control systems
- Legal terminology databases
- Audit trail and evidence management systems
- Change management and approval workflow systems

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without UI components
- Must support at least 10 major financial regulatory frameworks
- Must maintain audit trails for at least 7 years
- Must process documentation with at least 100,000 pages
- Must track at least 5,000 controlled vocabulary terms

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. A regulatory mapping engine that links documentation to specific compliance requirements
2. A snapshot system that creates immutable, timestamped documentation records
3. A terminology control system that enforces precise vocabulary usage
4. A gap analysis engine that identifies missing required documentation
5. A regulatory change monitoring system that tracks updates to applicable regulations
6. An audit evidence system that maintains records for compliance verification
7. A reporting system that produces compliance status reports for stakeholders

These components should work together to create a comprehensive compliance management system that ensures documentation meets all regulatory requirements while providing evidence of compliance for auditors.

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests for:

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Regulatory mapping correctly links documentation to specific requirements
- Snapshot system generates accurate, immutable documentation records
- Terminology control correctly identifies non-compliant vocabulary
- Gap analysis accurately identifies missing required content
- Regulatory update monitoring correctly identifies impacted documentation

### Critical User Scenarios
- A compliance specialist prepares documentation for a regulatory examination
- An auditor requests historical documentation from a specific compliance period
- A new regulatory requirement necessitates documentation updates
- A vocabulary standard changes, requiring terminology updates
- A compliance officer conducts a pre-audit documentation review

### Performance Benchmarks
- Regulatory mapping performs efficiently with large documentation sets
- Snapshot generation completes within time limits for complete documentation
- Vocabulary enforcement scales appropriately with increasing content volume
- Gap analysis completes efficiently for comprehensive regulatory frameworks
- Impact analysis delivers timely results for regulatory updates

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Handling conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions
- Managing documentation that spans multiple regulatory frameworks
- Processing ambiguous terminology with different meanings in different contexts
- Dealing with regulatory requirements that lack clear documentation parameters
- Handling retroactive regulatory changes that affect historical documentation

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 95% test coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for snapshot generation and immutability verification
- Integration tests for all external system interfaces
- Security tests for audit trail tamper protection

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Regulatory traceability maps at least 95% of documentation to specific requirements
2. Timestamped snapshots provide verifiable, immutable documentation records
3. Controlled vocabulary enforcement catches at least 98% of terminology violations
4. Compliance gap analysis identifies at least 90% of missing required content
5. Regulatory update monitoring correctly identifies documentation affected by changes

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. From within the project directory, create a virtual environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate the required report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.
