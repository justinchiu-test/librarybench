# Regulatory Documentation Compliance System

## Overview
A specialized documentation system designed for regulatory compliance management in financial software, providing regulatory requirement traceability, timestamped documentation snapshots, controlled vocabulary enforcement, compliance gap analysis, and regulatory update monitoring to ensure documentation meets strict financial industry requirements.

## Persona Description
Yasmin ensures that financial software documentation meets strict regulatory requirements. She needs to maintain auditable records of documentation changes and verify that all mandated disclosures and processes are properly documented.

## Key Requirements
1. **Regulatory Requirement Traceability** - Implement a system that maps documentation sections to specific regulations, standards, or compliance requirements, creating bidirectional links between regulatory obligations and their implementation documentation. This is critical for Yasmin because it enables auditors to quickly verify compliance coverage, helps identify documentation that needs updating when regulations change, and provides evidence of regulatory adherence during examinations.

2. **Timestamped Documentation Snapshots** - Develop functionality to capture and preserve point-in-time records of documentation states, with cryptographically verifiable timestamps and change tracking. This feature is essential because it provides immutable audit trails of what documentation existed at specific points in time, allows reconstruction of the exact documentation that was in effect during any past period, and creates legally defensible evidence for regulatory inquiries.

3. **Controlled Vocabulary Enforcement** - Create a framework that enforces the use of legally precise, regulator-approved terminology throughout documentation, flagging unapproved terms and suggesting compliant alternatives. This capability is vital for Yasmin because inconsistent or imprecise terminology can create legal and regulatory risks, lead to misinterpretation of procedures by staff, and potentially result in compliance violations due to ambiguous instructions.

4. **Compliance Gap Analysis** - Design an analytical system that identifies missing required disclosures, procedures, or documentations by comparing content against regulatory checklists. This is important for Yasmin because it systematically detects compliance gaps before regulators do, provides a clear remediation roadmap for missing documentation, and reduces the risk of findings during regulatory examinations.

5. **Regulatory Update Monitoring** - Implement a mechanism to track changes to relevant regulations and automatically identify documentation sections that may require updates as a result of regulatory changes. This is crucial for Yasmin because financial regulations change frequently, timely documentation updates are legally required, and the system helps ensure continuous compliance by alerting when documentation needs revision.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Regulatory mappings must be verifiable against known requirement sets
  - Timestamp verification must be cryptographically provable
  - Vocabulary enforcement must be testable with known compliant and non-compliant terms
  - Gap analysis must identify 100% of known documentation omissions in test cases
  - Regulatory change detection must correctly flag affected documentation

- **Performance Expectations**
  - System should process documentation sets of 5,000+ pages efficiently
  - Snapshot creation should complete in under 2 minutes for 1,000-page documentation
  - Vocabulary scanning should process 100+ pages per second
  - Gap analysis should complete for a full compliance domain in under 5 minutes
  - System should support at least 50 concurrent users without performance degradation

- **Integration Points**
  - Regulatory content sources (government publications, regulatory feeds)
  - Compliance management systems
  - Legal review and approval workflows
  - Document management and version control systems
  - Audit trails and logging infrastructure
  - Digital signature and timestamping services

- **Key Constraints**
  - All documentation versions must be immutably preserved
  - System must maintain complete chain of custody for all content
  - Access controls must enforce strict separation of duties
  - All regulatory mappings must be externally verifiable
  - System must function in highly restricted network environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a Python library with the following core modules:

1. **Regulatory Mapper**: Create and manage links between documentation elements and specific regulatory requirements.

2. **Documentation Versioner**: Capture, timestamp, and preserve point-in-time documentation snapshots with cryptographic verification.

3. **Vocabulary Controller**: Enforce terminology standards and identify non-compliant language.

4. **Compliance Analyzer**: Compare documentation against regulatory requirements to identify gaps and coverage issues.

5. **Regulatory Monitor**: Track changes to regulations and identify impacted documentation sections.

6. **Audit Trail Manager**: Maintain comprehensive, tamper-evident logs of all documentation activities.

7. **Export Generator**: Produce regulator-ready exports of documentation with compliance metadata.

These modules should be designed with clean interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly while maintaining the ability to use individual components independently.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate mapping between documentation elements and regulatory requirements
  - Cryptographically verifiable timestamping and version preservation
  - Precise identification of non-compliant terminology
  - Comprehensive detection of documentation gaps against requirements
  - Correct identification of documentation affected by regulatory changes

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Preparing documentation for a regulatory examination
  - Responding to an audit inquiry about historical documentation
  - Updating documentation in response to regulatory changes
  - Verifying compliance coverage across the full documentation set
  - Demonstrating to regulators that all required elements are documented

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Map 1,000+ regulatory requirements to documentation in under 10 minutes
  - Create verifiable snapshots of 5,000-page documentation set in under 5 minutes
  - Scan 10,000+ pages for terminology compliance in under 15 minutes
  - Complete gap analysis against 500+ regulatory requirements in under 10 minutes
  - Process regulatory updates and identify affected content in under 5 minutes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions
  - Documentation that applies to multiple regulatory regimes simultaneously
  - Regulatory language that is ambiguous or subject to interpretation
  - Retroactive regulatory changes affecting historical documentation
  - Recovery from interrupted snapshot creation or verification
  - Handling of documentation with embedded non-textual elements

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 95% line coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for timestamping and cryptographic verification
  - 100% coverage for audit trail functionality
  - 95%+ coverage for compliance gap analysis algorithms
  - 95%+ coverage for regulatory mapping functionality

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It correctly maps 100% of documentation elements to applicable regulatory requirements
2. Documentation snapshots are cryptographically verifiable and legally defensible
3. Vocabulary control identifies 95%+ of non-compliant terminology
4. Compliance gap analysis identifies 100% of missing required elements in test scenarios
5. Regulatory change monitoring correctly identifies 95%+ of documentation sections requiring updates
6. The system maintains tamper-evident audit trails of all documentation activities
7. All functions perform without a user interface while providing APIs for integration
8. All tests pass with the specified coverage metrics
