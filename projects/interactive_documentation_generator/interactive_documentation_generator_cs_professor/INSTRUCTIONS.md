# Interactive Programming Education Platform

## Overview
An advanced educational documentation system designed for computer science education that maps concept dependencies, provides interactive code exercises with automated validation, creates customized learning paths, collects aggregated performance metrics, and enables collaborative annotation to enhance student learning and engagement.

## Persona Description
Dr. Williams teaches programming courses and needs to create interactive textbook materials that students can explore at their own pace. He wants to combine theoretical concepts with practical, executable examples that demonstrate principles in action.

## Key Requirements
1. **Concept Dependency Mapping** - Implement a system that analyzes and visualizes prerequisite relationships between programming concepts, creating a structured knowledge graph that shows what topics a student must understand before tackling more advanced material. This is critical for Dr. Williams because it helps students navigate the curriculum logically, ensures they have necessary foundational knowledge before attempting advanced topics, and reduces frustration from attempting material they're not prepared for.

2. **Interactive Code Exercises** - Create a framework for embedding executable code examples with automated validation, hints, and progressive difficulty levels that adapt to student performance. This feature is essential because it provides immediate feedback on code correctness, reinforces theoretical concepts with hands-on practice, and allows students to experiment safely within a controlled environment that gradually scaffolds their learning.

3. **Learning Path Customization** - Develop functionality to generate personalized learning sequences based on student background, progress, and goals, adapting to different learning styles and prior knowledge. This capability is vital for Dr. Williams because it accommodates diverse student backgrounds in his courses, allows advanced students to move ahead while providing extra support to those who need it, and increases course completion rates through personalized pacing.

4. **Anonymous Performance Analytics** - Implement a system to collect and analyze aggregated, anonymized data on common misconceptions, exercise completion rates, and time spent on different concepts. This is important for Dr. Williams because it helps him identify concepts that students consistently struggle with, provides empirical data to improve his teaching materials, and enables evidence-based course refinement without compromising student privacy.

5. **Collaborative Annotation** - Design capabilities for students to share notes, questions, and insights within the documentation, creating a collaborative learning environment while preserving the original instructional content. This is crucial for Dr. Williams because it encourages peer learning, surfaces student questions that may indicate unclear explanations, and builds a community of practice around the course material that enhances the formal instruction.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Concept dependency mapping must be verifiable with known concept relationships
  - Code exercise validation must produce consistent results across execution environments
  - Learning path algorithms must generate reproducible paths given the same inputs
  - Analytics aggregation must maintain student anonymity while providing useful insights
  - Annotation functionality must preserve document integrity with proper versioning

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Interactive code execution should provide results within 3 seconds
  - Dependency graph generation should process 500+ concepts in under 10 seconds
  - Learning path customization should generate recommendations in under 2 seconds
  - System should support courses with 1,000+ students and 10,000+ exercises
  - Analytics processing should handle 100,000+ exercise submissions daily

- **Integration Points**
  - Code execution environments for multiple programming languages
  - Learning Management Systems (LMS) for optional grade synchronization
  - Version control systems for content management
  - Privacy-preserving analytics frameworks
  - Authentication systems for optional identified usage

- **Key Constraints**
  - All student performance data must be anonymized by default
  - Interactive examples must run in sandboxed environments for security
  - System must function without internet connectivity for classroom settings
  - Documentation must be exportable to offline formats for accessibility
  - All components must be highly configurable for different teaching approaches

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a Python library with the following core modules:

1. **Concept Analyzer**: Process educational content to identify and map concept relationships and dependencies.

2. **Exercise Framework**: Create, validate, and provide feedback on interactive code exercises with progressive difficulty.

3. **Path Generator**: Build customized learning sequences based on student profiles and performance data.

4. **Analytics Engine**: Collect and process anonymized performance data to identify learning patterns and obstacles.

5. **Annotation Manager**: Handle collaborative notes and questions while maintaining content integrity.

6. **Content Processor**: Parse and transform educational content into interactive formats with embedded exercises.

7. **Documentation Generator**: Produce comprehensive, navigable educational materials from structured content.

These modules should be designed with clean interfaces, allowing them to work together as an integrated system while maintaining the ability to use individual components independently for different educational contexts.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate identification and mapping of concept dependencies
  - Correct execution and validation of code exercises across programming languages
  - Appropriate learning path generation based on student parameters
  - Proper anonymization and aggregation of performance data
  - Functional annotation system that preserves document integrity

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Student navigating a complex topic through prerequisite concepts

  - Process a complete textbook of 500+ pages in under 5 minutes
  - Execute and validate 100 code exercises in under 3 minutes
  - Generate learning paths for 500 students in under 5 minutes
  - Process 10,000 exercise submissions for analytics in under 10 minutes
  - Support 100+ concurrent users adding annotations without performance degradation

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Circular dependencies in concept relationships
  - Code exercises with multiple valid solutions or approaches
  - Students with unusual learning profiles or backgrounds
  - Recovery from interrupted exercise submission or validation
  - Handling of malicious code in exercise submissions
  - Conflicting annotations targeting the same content

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% line coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for code execution sandboxing (for security)
  - 95%+ coverage for learning path generation algorithms
  - 95%+ coverage for data anonymization functions
  - 90%+ coverage for dependency mapping algorithms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
