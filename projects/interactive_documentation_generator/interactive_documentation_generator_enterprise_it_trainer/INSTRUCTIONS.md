# Role-Based Enterprise Documentation System

## Overview
The Role-Based Enterprise Documentation System is a specialized documentation engine designed for enterprise IT trainers who need to create and maintain consistent yet role-specific technical documentation across large organizations. It generates customized documentation paths, integrates with enterprise authentication, tracks training progress, adapts terminology to match company standards, and verifies regulatory compliance - all to streamline enterprise-wide software adoption.

## Persona Description
Barbara develops training materials for large enterprise software deployments. She needs to create role-specific documentation that adapts to different technical roles within the organization while maintaining consistency across all materials.

## Key Requirements

1. **Role-Based Content Paths**
   - Generate customized documentation that adapts content based on specific job functions
   - Critical for Barbara because different roles in the enterprise (administrators, end-users, developers, security teams) need different views of the same system
   - Must support at least 8 distinct role profiles with appropriate content filtering
   - Should preserve core content consistency while adapting detail level, examples, and sections based on role
   - Must provide a mechanism for easily defining new roles and their content requirements

2. **Enterprise Authentication Integration**
   - Secure documentation access based on enterprise identity and permission systems
   - Essential for Barbara to restrict sensitive configuration details to authorized roles
   - Must integrate with common enterprise authentication systems (LDAP, Active Directory, SAML SSO, etc.)
   - Should apply content visibility rules based on authenticated user's role and permissions
   - Must maintain a complete audit trail of documentation access for compliance purposes

3. **Training Progress Tracking**
   - Monitor and report on individual and team progress through training materials
   - Vital for Barbara to ensure all enterprise staff complete required training and identify knowledge gaps
   - Must include checkpoint verification to confirm understanding of critical concepts
   - Should generate progress reports by department, role, and training module
   - Must support both self-directed learning and instructor-led tracking scenarios

4. **Organization-Specific Terminology Adaptation**
   - Customize technical terms and references to match company-specific language
   - Critical for Barbara because enterprises often have their own naming conventions for systems and processes
   - Must support global search and replace of terminology with proper context awareness
   - Should maintain a terminology dictionary that persists across documentation updates
   - Must handle complex term replacements including context-dependent variations

5. **Compliance Verification System**
   - Ensure all required regulatory and policy information is included in appropriate sections
   - Essential for Barbara to guarantee that enterprise documentation meets industry regulations and internal governance requirements
   - Must support mapping documentation sections to compliance requirements
   - Should flag missing or outdated compliance information
   - Must generate compliance reports suitable for audit purposes

## Technical Requirements

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Role-Based Enterprise Documentation System should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Content Analysis and Processing**
   - Parse source code, markdown, and structured documentation
   - Extract technical information with appropriate metadata
   - Create modular content blocks that can be filtered by role
   - Apply complexity scoring to determine appropriate audience

2. **Role Management**
   - Define role profiles with associated permissions and content requirements
   - Map content modules to appropriate roles
   - Generate role-specific views with appropriate detail levels
   - Maintain consistent core content across all role variations

3. **Security and Authentication**
   - Interface with enterprise identity management systems
   - Apply permission-based content filtering
   - Record access patterns for audit purposes
   - Secure sensitive content with appropriate controls

4. **Learning Progress Management**
   - Track completion status for documentation modules
   - Implement knowledge verification checkpoints
   - Generate progress reports and identify knowledge gaps
   - Support both individual and team-based progress tracking

5. **Enterprise Customization**
   - Implement terminology mapping and replacement
   - Handle context-aware term substitution
   - Maintain organizational dictionary
   - Apply consistent terminology across all documentation

6. **Compliance Management**
   - Map documentation to regulatory requirements
   - Verify compliance coverage and identify gaps
   - Generate compliance reports for audit purposes
   - Track changes to compliance-critical content

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct generation of role-specific documentation views
- Proper integration with authentication systems
