# Role-Based Enterprise Documentation System

A specialized documentation generation platform that delivers personalized, role-specific technical documentation for enterprise software training and deployment.

## Overview

The Role-Based Enterprise Documentation System enables IT trainers to generate and manage customized documentation paths for different roles within large organizations. It adapts content based on job functions, tracks training progress, enforces enterprise security controls, and ensures compliance with organizational terminology and regulatory requirements.

## Persona Description

Barbara develops training materials for large enterprise software deployments. She needs to create role-specific documentation that adapts to different technical roles within the organization while maintaining consistency across all materials.

## Key Requirements

1. **Role-Based Content Paths** - The system must generate customized documentation paths tailored to specific job functions within the organization. This is essential for Barbara because enterprise deployments involve diverse roles (administrators, end-users, developers, security teams) with different knowledge requirements, and delivering role-appropriate content maximizes training effectiveness while preventing information overload.

2. **Enterprise Authentication Integration** - The system must integrate with corporate identity management systems to restrict access to sensitive configuration details based on authorized roles. This is critical for Barbara as enterprise documentation often contains confidential settings and security information that must only be accessible to authorized personnel, ensuring compliance with organizational security policies.

3. **Training Progress Tracking** - The documentation system must provide checkpoints throughout the content with knowledge verification and track completion status for each user. As a trainer responsible for ensuring competency across the organization, Barbara needs this feature to identify knowledge gaps, provide targeted assistance, and report on training completion to stakeholders.

4. **Organization-Specific Terminology Customization** - The tool must support replacement of standard technical terms with company-specific terminology throughout all documentation. This is vital for Barbara because large enterprises often develop their own technical vocabulary, and mapping standard terms to company-specific language ensures documentation is immediately understandable and relevant to the organizational context.

5. **Compliance Verification** - The system must verify that all relevant regulatory and policy requirements are covered in appropriate documentation sections. For Barbara, ensuring documentation addresses all compliance requirements (security standards, industry regulations, internal policies) is essential to prevent compliance gaps during software deployment that could expose the organization to risk.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable in isolation with pytest fixtures
- Role-based content generation must be verifiable with parameterized tests
- Authentication integration must be testable with mock identity providers
- Progress tracking must be verifiable with simulated user sessions
- Compliance coverage must be testable against defined requirement matrices

### Performance Expectations
- Documentation generation for a complete enterprise system must complete in under 2 minutes
- Role-based filtering must apply instantaneously (< 100ms) when changing user contexts
- Progress tracking data must be retrievable in under 500ms even with 10,000+ users
- Terminology replacement must not add more than 10% overhead to document generation

### Integration Points
- Enterprise identity management systems (LDAP, Active Directory, SAML)
- Learning Management Systems (LMS) for progress tracking
- Compliance management systems for requirement mapping
- Enterprise glossary/terminology management systems
- Existing enterprise documentation repositories

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without UI components
- Must process and protect sensitive enterprise configuration information
- Must scale to support documentation for systems with 1000+ configuration options
- Must support at least 20 distinct organizational roles
- Must handle training programs with at least 50 distinct learning modules

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. A role definition engine that maps job functions to documentation content requirements
2. A content filtering system that generates role-appropriate documentation views
3. An authentication integration layer for secure access control
4. A progress tracking framework with knowledge verification points
5. A terminology management system with organization-specific vocabulary mapping
6. A compliance verification system that maps documentation sections to regulatory requirements
7. A documentation generation pipeline that applies all these filters to create customized documentation

These components should work together to create a documentation system that delivers the right information to the right people at the right time, while maintaining security, consistency, and compliance across the enterprise.

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests for:

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Role-based content correctly filters information based on job functions
- Authentication integration properly restricts access to sensitive content
- Progress tracking accurately records completion status and assessment results
- Terminology replacement consistently applies organization-specific terms
- Compliance verification identifies gaps in regulatory coverage

### Critical User Scenarios
- A new employee accesses role-appropriate training documentation
- An administrator creates role definitions for a new department
- A compliance officer verifies documentation coverage for a new regulation
- A trainer generates progress reports for different teams
- A technical writer adds new content with role-specific variations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Documentation generation completes within time limits for large enterprise systems
- Role-based filtering applies instantly when user context changes
- Progress tracking retrieval performs efficiently with large user bases
- Terminology replacement adds minimal overhead to document processing

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Handling users with multiple roles or unusual permission combinations
- Processing content with complex or nested role restrictions
- Managing terminology conflicts or ambiguous term mappings
- Dealing with incomplete compliance requirement definitions
- Handling authentication edge cases (token expiration, permission changes)

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% test coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for authentication and access control functions
- Integration tests for all external system interfaces

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. The system can generate different documentation versions for at least 5 distinct organizational roles
2. Authentication integration successfully restricts access based on user roles and permissions
3. Progress tracking captures completion status and knowledge verification results
4. Terminology replacement consistently maps standard terms to organization-specific language
5. Compliance verification successfully identifies documentation gaps for defined requirements

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. From within the project directory, create a virtual environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate the required report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.
