# Documentation Localization Management System

## Overview
The Documentation Localization Management System is a specialized documentation tool designed for localization specialists who adapt technical documentation for international markets. It provides translation memory integration, cultural adaptation flagging, bidirectional text support, localization progress tracking, and visual element annotation - helping localization teams efficiently manage translations while preserving technical precision and cultural appropriateness across multiple languages.

## Persona Description
Sophia adapts technical documentation for international markets, ensuring content is culturally appropriate and technically accurate across languages. She needs to efficiently manage translations while preserving interactive elements and technical precision.

## Key Requirements

1. **Translation Memory Integration**
   - Integrate with translation memory systems to reduce redundant translation of repeated technical terms
   - Critical for Sophia because technical documentation contains many specialized terms that should be translated consistently
   - Must identify and track technical terminology across documentation
   - Should suggest consistent translations based on previous translations
   - Must support standard translation memory exchange formats (TMX, XLIFF)
   - Should calculate potential time/cost savings from translation memory matches

2. **Cultural Adaptation Flagging**
   - Identify concepts, examples, or references that may need market-specific explanations or adaptations
   - Essential for Sophia to ensure documentation is culturally appropriate for target markets
   - Must detect culturally-specific references (idioms, analogies, examples)
   - Should suggest alternative approaches for problematic content
   - Must support custom rules for different target cultures
   - Should prioritize flags based on potential for misunderstanding

3. **Bidirectional Text Support**
   - Handle right-to-left languages properly throughout the documentation system
   - Vital for Sophia to support Arabic, Hebrew, and other RTL languages without layout issues
   - Must correctly manage text direction in mixed language environments
   - Should handle direction-dependent UI elements and examples
   - Must preserve code samples and technical syntax while adapting surrounding text
   - Should provide visual preview of bidirectional layouts

4. **Localization Progress Tracking**
   - Monitor and report on translation status across target languages
   - Critical for Sophia to manage complex translation projects with multiple languages and deadlines
   - Must track completion percentage by language, section, and component
   - Should estimate remaining effort based on historical translation rates
   - Must identify bottlenecks and critical path items
   - Should generate reports suitable for stakeholder updates

5. **Visual Element Annotation**
   - Identify and mark text within graphics, diagrams, and screenshots for translation
   - Essential for Sophia to ensure that all translatable content is captured, including text embedded in images
   - Must detect text in various image formats
   - Should extract text for translation while preserving positioning
   - Must track relationships between source images and localized versions
   - Should support automated text replacement in compatible image formats

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have pytest test suites with at least 90% code coverage
- Translation memory integration must be testable with standardized translation datasets
- Cultural flagging algorithms must be verifiable against pre-annotated content
- Bidirectional text handling must be tested with mixed-direction content
- Progress tracking must be validated against known translation workloads
- Image text extraction must be tested with a diverse set of technical diagrams

### Performance Expectations
- Translation memory lookup must complete within 100ms per term
- Content analysis for cultural adaptation must process 100 pages per minute
- Bidirectional text transformations must render in real-time
- Progress calculations must handle projects with 50+ languages and 10,000+ content segments
- Image analysis must process 10 diagrams per minute with 95% text detection accuracy

### Integration Points
- Translation memory systems (SDL Trados, Smartling, MemoQ, etc.)
- Image processing libraries for text detection
- Content management systems for document storage
- Project management tools for workflow and deadline tracking
- Reporting systems for progress visualization

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without a UI component
- The system must preserve formatting and technical accuracy during translation
- Must work with common documentation formats (Markdown, HTML, XML, etc.)
- Translation workflows must support offline and online modes
- Must operate efficiently on standard hardware without specialized GPU requirements

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Documentation Localization Management System should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Content Analysis and Preparation**
   - Parse documentation to identify translatable segments
   - Extract technical terminology and repetitive phrases
   - Detect culturally-specific content requiring adaptation
   - Prepare content for translation with appropriate context

2. **Translation Support**
   - Integrate with translation memory for consistent terminology
   - Manage segment alignment between source and translated content
   - Support batch processing of similar content
   - Preserve formatting, links, and technical elements during translation

3. **Multilingual Content Handling**
   - Implement proper text direction management for all supported languages
   - Handle language-specific formatting requirements
   - Support mixed-direction content with correct rendering
   - Manage character encoding and special characters across languages

4. **Project Management**
   - Track translation status at multiple granularity levels
   - Calculate progress metrics and estimate completion
   - Identify dependencies and critical path items
   - Generate status reports for different stakeholders

5. **Visual Content Management**
   - Analyze images to detect embedded text
   - Extract text for translation while preserving context
   - Generate annotated versions for translator reference
   - Support reinsertion of translated text into images

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate identification and consistent translation of technical terminology
- Correct detection of culturally-specific content requiring adaptation
- Proper handling of bidirectional text in various contexts
- Accurate progress tracking across multiple languages and components
- Successful extraction and reinsertion of text from visual elements

### Critical User Scenarios
- A technical term appears multiple times and is consistently translated
- A culturally-specific example is flagged for adaptation to a target market
- Content containing mixed left-to-right and right-to-left text renders correctly
- A project manager receives accurate progress reports with remaining effort estimates
- A diagram with embedded text is processed with all text properly extracted for translation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process documentation with 100,000 words in under 10 minutes

- Accuracy tests for text extraction from various image types

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
