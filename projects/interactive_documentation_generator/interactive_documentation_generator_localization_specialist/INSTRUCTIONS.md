# Multilingual Documentation Localization System

## Overview
A specialized documentation management system for localization specialists that integrates translation memory capabilities, identifies cultural adaptation needs, provides robust bidirectional text support, tracks localization progress, and ensures proper handling of visual elements across languages and locales.

## Persona Description
Sophia adapts technical documentation for international markets, ensuring content is culturally appropriate and technically accurate across languages. She needs to efficiently manage translations while preserving interactive elements and technical precision.

## Key Requirements
1. **Translation Memory Integration** - Implement a system that identifies and tracks repeated technical terms and phrases across documentation, maintaining a translation database to ensure consistent translations and reduce redundant work. This is critical for Sophia because it dramatically reduces translation costs and time while ensuring technical terminology maintains consistent meaning across all localized content.

2. **Cultural Adaptation Flagging** - Develop a content analysis capability that identifies concepts, examples, or metaphors that may require market-specific explanations or adaptations based on cultural context. This feature is essential because it helps Sophia proactively identify content that might confuse or inadvertently offend users in different cultural contexts, improving the effectiveness of localized documentation.

3. **Bidirectional Text Support** - Create comprehensive support for right-to-left languages (like Arabic and Hebrew) across all documentation elements, including code examples, diagrams, and interactive components. This capability is vital for Sophia because it ensures documentation is properly rendered and usable for all target audiences without broken layouts or confusion about reading order.

4. **Localization Progress Tracking** - Implement a tracking system that monitors translation completion status across target languages, identifying bottlenecks and displaying real-time progress metrics. This is important for Sophia because it helps her manage complex localization projects with multiple languages and deadlines, prioritize efforts, and provide accurate timeline estimates to stakeholders.

5. **Visual Element Annotation** - Design a system to identify and mark text within images, diagrams, and other visual elements that requires translation, ensuring no user-facing content is overlooked. This is crucial for Sophia because untranslated visual elements are a common source of localization errors that undermine the quality of otherwise well-translated documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Translation memory matching algorithms must be testable with known phrase databases
  - Cultural adaptation detection must be verifiable with test content containing known cultural references
  - Bidirectional text handling must be testable with right-to-left content examples
  - Progress tracking must produce consistent results with deterministic test scenarios
  - Visual element detection must be testable with sample images containing embedded text

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Translation memory lookups should complete in under 100ms per query
  - System should efficiently process documentation sets of 1,000+ pages
  - Batch processing for new language addition should complete in under 30 minutes for large documentation sets
  - Progress calculations should update within 5 seconds of status changes
  - Image analysis for text detection should process 100 images in under 5 minutes

- **Integration Points**
  - Translation Management Systems (TMS) for workflow integration
  - Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) tools for translator support
  - Content Management Systems (CMS) for content retrieval and storage
  - Image processing tools for visual element text detection
  - Version control systems for tracking changes across translations

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must support at least 10 major language families including right-to-left scripts
  - All text extraction and replacement must preserve markup and formatting
  - System must handle all Unicode character ranges correctly
  - Translation memory must be exportable in industry-standard formats (TMX, XLIFF)
  - All operations must be scriptable for automation pipelines

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a Python library with the following core modules:

1. **Document Parser**: Extract content from various documentation formats while preserving structure and formatting.

2. **Translation Memory**: Store, retrieve, and manage previously translated terms and phrases with context awareness.

3. **Cultural Context Analyzer**: Identify content that may require cultural adaptation or localization notes.

4. **Bidirectional Text Processor**: Handle right-to-left text rendering and mixed-direction content correctly.

5. **Progress Tracker**: Monitor and report on localization status across languages and documentation components.

6. **Visual Content Analyzer**: Detect and extract text from images and diagrams for translation.

7. **Localization Packager**: Assemble and export localized documentation in appropriate formats.

These modules should be designed with clean interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly while maintaining the ability to use individual components independently.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate identification and tracking of translatable content
  - Correct matching of phrases against translation memory
  - Proper identification of content requiring cultural adaptation
  - Accurate rendering of bidirectional text in various contexts
  - Reliable tracking of localization progress across languages
  - Successful detection of text in images and visual elements

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Adding a new target language to an existing documentation set
  - Updating source content and propagating changes to translations
  - Identifying culturally sensitive content before translation begins
  - Tracking localization progress across a large documentation project
  - Ensuring completeness of localization including visual elements
  - Maintaining consistency of technical terminology across languages

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Process a 1,000-page documentation set for translation preparation in under 15 minutes
  - Perform translation memory lookups on 10,000 segments in under 5 minutes
  - Analyze 500 images for text detection in under 10 minutes
  - Generate progress reports for a project with 20 target languages in under 30 seconds
  - Support translation memory with 100,000+ entries with lookup times under 200ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Mixed language content requiring selective translation
  - Complex bidirectional text with embedded code examples
  - Untranslatable content (commands, proper names) that should be preserved
  - Images with text that is difficult to detect (low contrast, stylized fonts)
  - Handling of languages with significantly different sentence structures
  - Recovery from interrupted translation processes

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% line coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for bidirectional text handling (critical for RTL languages)
  - 95%+ coverage for translation memory matching algorithms
  - 95%+ coverage for progress tracking calculations
  - 90%+ coverage for cultural context analysis

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It correctly identifies and manages 95%+ of translatable content in documentation
2. Translation memory matching achieves 90%+ accuracy for technical terminology
3. Cultural adaptation flagging identifies 85%+ of content requiring market-specific changes
4. Bidirectional text handling correctly renders 100% of right-to-left content
5. Localization progress tracking provides accurate metrics across target languages
6. Visual element analysis identifies 90%+ of text requiring translation in images
7. The system functions without a user interface while providing APIs for integration
8. All tests pass with the specified coverage metrics
