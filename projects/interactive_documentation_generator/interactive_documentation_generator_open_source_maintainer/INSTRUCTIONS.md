# Open Source Documentation Evolution Engine

## Overview
The Open Source Documentation Evolution Engine is a specialized documentation system designed for rapidly evolving open source projects with distributed contributor bases. It automatically detects API changes, tracks documentation coverage, and generates platform-specific examples - enabling maintainers to provide high-quality documentation that scales with community growth while minimizing maintenance overhead.

## Persona Description
Mei is the lead maintainer of a popular open source library with a global contributor base. She needs to make the documentation both approachable for newcomers and comprehensive for experienced users while reducing the maintenance burden as the project evolves rapidly.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automated API Change Detection**
   - Automatically identify and highlight breaking changes between versions in documentation
   - Critical for Mei because her open source project evolves rapidly, and users need clear visibility into what will break when upgrading
   - Must provide visual differentiation between minor changes, major changes, and completely new features
   - Should generate migration guides based on detected breaking changes

2. **Contribution Metrics Dashboard**
   - Track and visualize documentation coverage by community members
   - Essential for Mei to recognize contributors who help with documentation and identify areas where the community is actively contributing or where contribution is lacking
   - Must provide actionable insights on documentation health per module/component
   - Should highlight "documentation heroes" to recognize community efforts

3. **Multi-Platform Example Generation**
   - Generate and validate code examples across different environments and runtime versions
   - Vital for Mei's project which runs on multiple platforms and language versions, ensuring examples work everywhere
   - Must support at least 3 major platforms (e.g., Windows, MacOS, Linux) and multiple runtime versions
   - Should detect and flag platform-specific concerns or limitations

4. **CI/CD Integration Hooks**
   - Seamlessly integrate with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other CI systems for continuous documentation deployment
   - Critical for Mei to ensure documentation is always in sync with the latest code changes
   - Must provide build status notifications and validation reports
   - Should automatically deploy updated documentation when tests pass

5. **Documentation Health Score**
   - Calculate and display comprehensive metrics on documentation completeness, quality, and accuracy
   - Essential for Mei to quickly identify areas of documentation that need attention as the project evolves
   - Must provide granular scoring at module, class, and function levels
   - Should suggest specific improvements based on detected problems

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have pytest test suites with at least a 90% code coverage
- The API change detection algorithm must be tested with version pairs known to have breaking changes
- Example generation must be tested with mock environments to validate multi-platform support
- Integration hooks should use fixture-based tests with mock CI services
- Health score calculation must be validated against pre-scored documentation examples

### Performance Expectations
- API change detection must complete within 30 seconds for projects with up to 100,000 lines of code
- Documentation generation must process at least 1000 functions/methods per minute
- CI hook interactions should add no more than 10 seconds to build processes
- Health score calculations should complete within 5 seconds for the entire project
- The system should handle repositories with at least 1000 contributors without performance degradation

### Integration Points
- Abstract interfaces for CI system integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Version control system integration (Git required, others optional)
- Executable environment integration for validating examples (Python, virtualenv, conda, etc.)
- Issue tracker integration for linking documentation issues
- Contributor identity systems for metrics tracking

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without a UI component
- The system must operate without requiring privileged access to repositories
- Documentation processing must work offline once initial repository is cloned
- No external API dependencies for core functionality
- Must be usable on repositories without modifying their structure

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Open Source Documentation Evolution Engine should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Code and Documentation Analysis**
   - Parse source code to extract structure, APIs, and docstrings
   - Compare versions to identify changes (signatures, parameters, return types)
   - Extract and validate code examples from docstrings
   - Analyze documentation coverage and completeness

2. **Documentation Generation**
   - Transform analyzed code into structured documentation objects
   - Generate platform-specific examples based on detected environment differences
   - Produce versioned documentation sets that highlight changes
   - Create migration guides based on breaking changes

3. **Contributor Analytics**
   - Track documentation changes by contributor
   - Calculate and present documentation coverage metrics
   - Identify documentation gaps and contribution opportunities
   - Generate recognition reports for documentation contributors

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Hooks for triggering documentation builds on code changes
   - Validation of documentation accuracy during CI processes
   - Automated deployment of updated documentation
   - Status reporting to repository contribution workflows

5. **Health Monitoring**
   - Scoring algorithms for documentation quality and completeness
   - Trend analysis for documentation health over time
   - Alerting mechanisms for documentation deterioration
   - Recommendation engine for documentation improvements

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct identification of API changes between versions with proper classification
- Accurate tracking of contributor metrics with appropriate attribution
- Successful generation of examples that run correctly on specified platforms
- Proper integration with CI systems with appropriate hooks and events
- Accurate calculation of documentation health scores with actionable recommendations

### Critical User Scenarios
- A new version introduces breaking API changes that are automatically detected and highlighted
- A contributor adds documentation and their contribution metrics are properly tracked
- Examples are generated for multiple platforms and validate successfully
- Documentation is automatically built and deployed through CI integration
- Documentation health deteriorates in a module and the system flags it for attention

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process repositories with up to 100,000 lines of code in under 2 minutes
- Generate documentation for at least 1000 functions per minute
- Support concurrent analysis of multiple versions with linear scaling
- Handle repositories with 1000+ contributors without performance degradation
- Complete CI integration processes within 15 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of poorly documented code with minimal or incorrect docstrings
- Processing of repositories with unusual or non-standard structures
- Managing conflicting or overlapping documentation contributions
- Recovery from failed CI builds or deployments
- Handling of examples that cannot be validated on certain platforms

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of public APIs
- Integration tests for all CI system connectors
- Performance tests for all operations on large repositories
- Validation tests for health score metrics

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
