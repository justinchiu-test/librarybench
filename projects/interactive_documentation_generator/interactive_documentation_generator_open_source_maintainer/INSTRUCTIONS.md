# Open Source Library Documentation Generator

## Overview
An advanced documentation generation system tailored for open source projects that automatically identifies API changes, highlights contribution metrics, supports multi-platform examples, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and provides health scores to guide documentation improvement efforts as the codebase evolves.

## Persona Description
Mei is the lead maintainer of a popular open source library with a global contributor base. She needs to make the documentation both approachable for newcomers and comprehensive for experienced users while reducing the maintenance burden as the project evolves rapidly.

## Key Requirements
1. **Automated API Change Detection** - The system must analyze code repositories to automatically detect and highlight API changes between versions, with special emphasis on breaking changes. This is critical for Mei because it allows contributors and users to quickly understand how updates impact their code, reducing support requests and migration issues.

2. **Contribution Metrics Dashboard** - Implement a metrics system that tracks documentation coverage by community members, showing which parts of the codebase are well-documented and by whom. This feature is essential because it gamifies documentation contributions, incentivizes community involvement, and helps Mei identify active documentation contributors for recognition.

3. **Multi-Platform Example Generation** - Create a framework that automatically generates and validates code examples across different environments and runtime versions. This is vital for Mei because her library is used across diverse platforms, and ensuring examples work correctly in all supported environments prevents frustration for users with different setups.

4. **CI/CD Integration Hooks** - Develop integration capabilities with common CI/CD systems (particularly GitHub Actions and GitLab CI) for automatic documentation deployment. This requirement is crucial as it ensures documentation stays synchronized with code changes, eliminating the common problem of outdated documentation that frustrates users and increases support burden.

5. **Documentation Health Scoring** - Implement an analytical system that evaluates documentation quality and identifies areas needing attention based on multiple factors (coverage, clarity, examples, etc.). This is important for Mei because it helps prioritize documentation efforts efficiently, focusing limited contributor resources on the most critical documentation gaps.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must be unit-testable with at least 85% code coverage
  - Integration tests must verify the accuracy of API change detection with sample codebases
  - Mock repositories must be used to test version control integration
  - Example generation must be testable across defined target environments
  - Health scoring algorithms must produce consistent, verifiable results

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Documentation generation must complete in under 5 minutes for repositories up to 100MB
  - API change detection must handle repositories with up to 10,000 commits efficiently
  - System should support parallel processing of multiple components for large codebases
  - CI/CD operations should add no more than 3 minutes to build pipelines

- **Integration Points**
  - Git-based version control systems (primarily GitHub, GitLab)
  - CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Travis CI)
  - Package registries for version comparison
  - Multiple language runtimes for example validation
  - Markdown, reStructuredText, and HTML output formats

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must function without database dependencies (file-based storage only)
  - All operations must be possible via command line for CI integration
  - No reliance on proprietary services that limit open source usage
  - Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Low memory footprint to work within CI environment limitations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a Python library with the following core modules:

1. **Repository Analyzer**: Parse source code repositories to extract API definitions, documentation content, and version history.

2. **Change Detector**: Compare code across versions to automatically detect API changes, categorizing them as additions, modifications, deprecations, or breaking changes.

3. **Example Manager**: Extract, validate, and generate executable code examples for different platforms and runtime environments.

4. **Metrics Collector**: Track and analyze documentation coverage, contributor activity, and documentation quality metrics.

5. **Health Scorer**: Evaluate documentation quality using configurable criteria and generate actionable improvement recommendations.

6. **CI Integrator**: Provide hooks and configuration templates for common CI/CD platforms to automate documentation deployment.

These modules should work together through a command-line interface, allowing for flexible automation while maintaining the ability to use individual components as needed.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate detection of API changes between versions
  - Correct classification of breaking vs. non-breaking changes
  - Successful generation and validation of examples across platforms
  - Accurate contribution metrics collection
  - Consistent health scoring with actionable recommendations
  - Proper integration with CI/CD workflows

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - New version release with API changes
  - First-time contributor adding documentation
  - Identification and remediation of documentation gaps
  - Documentation deployment through CI pipeline
  - Multi-platform example validation

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Process a 50MB repository in under 2 minutes
  - Handle repositories with 5,000+ commits without performance degradation
  - Successfully process and validate 100+ code examples in under 3 minutes
  - Generate complete documentation set in under 5 minutes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Repositories with unusual structures or missing components
  - Invalid or syntactically incorrect code examples
  - Handling of merge conflicts in documentation files
  - Recovery from interrupted CI/CD processes
  - Graceful failure when environment lacks required dependencies

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 85% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage for API change detection algorithms
  - 100% coverage for health score calculations
  - 90%+ coverage for example generation and validation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It correctly identifies 95%+ of API changes between versions, with 99%+ accuracy for breaking changes
2. Code examples successfully validate across all specified target platforms
3. Documentation health scores correlate with user-reported documentation quality (measured through contributor feedback)
4. CI/CD integration successfully deploys updated documentation within 5 minutes of code changes
5. The system can be operated entirely through command line and configuration files
6. Contribution metrics accurately reflect the actual documentation work done by contributors
7. All tests pass with the specified coverage metrics
8. The system functions correctly on the three major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
