# Regulatory Documentation Compliance System

## Overview
The Regulatory Documentation Compliance System is a specialized documentation tool designed for financial compliance specialists who need to ensure documentation meets strict regulatory requirements. It provides regulatory requirement traceability, timestamped documentation snapshots, controlled vocabulary enforcement, compliance gap analysis, and regulatory update monitoring - helping organizations maintain auditable documentation that satisfies complex and evolving regulatory standards.

## Persona Description
Yasmin ensures that financial software documentation meets strict regulatory requirements. She needs to maintain auditable records of documentation changes and verify that all mandated disclosures and processes are properly documented.

## Key Requirements

1. **Regulatory Requirement Traceability**
   - Map documentation sections directly to specific regulations and compliance requirements
   - Critical for Yasmin because auditors require clear evidence that all regulatory requirements are properly documented
   - Must support mapping to multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously (e.g., GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA)
   - Should maintain bidirectional links between regulations and documentation sections
   - Must track coverage metrics for each regulatory framework
   - Should generate traceability matrices for audit purposes

2. **Timestamped Documentation Snapshots**
   - Create immutable, point-in-time records of documentation for audit purposes
   - Essential for Yasmin to prove what documentation existed at any point in time
   - Must generate cryptographically verifiable snapshots of documentation
   - Should store snapshots with tamper-evident mechanisms
   - Must maintain complete version history with author information
   - Should support legal hold processes for relevant documentation

3. **Controlled Vocabulary Enforcement**
   - Ensure consistent and legally precise terminology throughout all documentation
   - Vital for Yasmin because regulatory compliance often depends on precise, legally-defined terminology
   - Must enforce use of approved terms and discourage ambiguous language
   - Should detect unapproved terminology with suggested replacements
   - Must support industry-specific and regulation-specific glossaries
   - Should track terminology usage across documentation

4. **Compliance Gap Analysis**
   - Identify missing required disclosures or procedures in documentation
   - Critical for Yasmin to proactively find and fix compliance issues before audits
   - Must compare documentation against regulatory requirements to find gaps
   - Should prioritize gaps based on compliance risk
   - Must generate detailed reports of compliance deficiencies
   - Should suggest remediation approaches for identified gaps

5. **Regulatory Update Monitoring**
   - Alert when changes to regulations affect documentation requirements
   - Essential for Yasmin to ensure documentation remains compliant as regulations evolve
   - Must track changes to relevant regulatory frameworks
   - Should identify documentation sections impacted by regulatory changes
   - Must calculate compliance impact scores for regulatory updates
   - Should prioritize documentation updates based on compliance deadlines

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have pytest test suites with at least 95% code coverage
- Regulatory mapping must be testable with mock regulations and documentation
- Snapshot mechanisms must be verifiable for cryptographic integrity
- Vocabulary enforcement must be tested against reference terminologies
- Gap analysis must be validated against known compliance deficiencies
- Update monitoring must be tested with historical regulatory changes

### Performance Expectations
- System must handle documentation sets up to 100,000 pages
- Regulatory mapping must process 1,000 requirements in under 5 minutes
- Snapshot generation must complete in under 30 seconds for 10,000 page documentation
- Vocabulary scanning must process 10MB of text per second
- Gap analysis must complete full documentation scan in under 10 minutes
- Regulatory update impact assessment must complete in under 2 minutes

### Integration Points
- Regulatory databases for requirement information
- Document management systems for content access
- Version control systems for history tracking
- Hashing and cryptographic systems for verification
- Notification systems for alerts and warnings
- Audit management systems for compliance reporting

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without a UI component
- The system must leave no possibility of tampering with audit records
- Documentation snapshots must be verifiable by third-party auditors
- Must support operation in air-gapped environments for high-security scenarios
- Solution must not impact performance of production documentation systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Regulatory Documentation Compliance System should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Regulatory Framework Management**
   - Import and structure regulatory requirements
   - Maintain relationships between requirements
   - Track regulatory changes and updates
   - Support multiple jurisdictions and frameworks

2. **Documentation Analysis and Mapping**
   - Parse documentation to identify compliance-relevant content
   - Map content to specific regulatory requirements
   - Calculate compliance coverage metrics
   - Identify compliance gaps and deficiencies

3. **Audit Trail Management**
   - Generate immutable documentation snapshots
   - Create cryptographic verification of content integrity
   - Maintain complete history of documentation changes
   - Support audit processes and information requests

4. **Language and Terminology Control**
   - Maintain regulatory terminology dictionaries
   - Scan content for terminology compliance
   - Enforce controlled vocabulary usage
   - Detect potential compliance language issues

5. **Compliance Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Track regulatory changes and updates
   - Assess impact on existing documentation
   - Generate compliance risk assessments
   - Provide actionable compliance alerts

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate mapping between documentation and regulatory requirements
- Reliable creation and verification of documentation snapshots
- Precise identification of controlled vocabulary violations
- Comprehensive detection of compliance gaps
- Timely and accurate regulatory change impact assessment

### Critical User Scenarios
- A compliance officer maps existing documentation to a new regulatory framework
- An auditor requests verification of documentation as it existed on a specific date
- A documentation team receives feedback on terminology issues that create compliance risk
- A compliance manager identifies and addresses gaps in required disclosures
- A regulatory specialist assesses documentation impacts of new regulatory updates

### Performance Benchmarks
- Map 10,000 pages of documentation to 1,000 regulatory requirements in under 1 hour
- Generate and cryptographically verify snapshots of 5,000 pages in under 5 minutes
- Scan 100,000 pages for terminology compliance in under 30 minutes
- Complete gap analysis against 5 regulatory frameworks in under 20 minutes
- Process regulatory updates and generate impact reports in under 10 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling conflicting requirements across multiple regulatory frameworks
- Managing documentation that undergoes extensive changes between snapshots
- Processing terminology with context-dependent regulatory meanings
- Addressing ambiguous mapping between requirements and documentation
- Handling regulatory framework changes that fundamentally alter requirements

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% line coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of cryptographic verification code
- Comprehensive tests for all regulatory mapping algorithms
- Extensive validation of gap analysis mechanisms
- Complete testing of all terminology enforcement rules

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
