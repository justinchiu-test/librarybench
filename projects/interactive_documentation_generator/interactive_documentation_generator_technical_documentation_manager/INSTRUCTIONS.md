# Documentation Suite Orchestrator

## Overview
The Documentation Suite Orchestrator is a specialized technical documentation system designed for managers overseeing complex, multi-product software documentation. It provides cross-reference visualization, coverage analysis, terminology enforcement, workload allocation, and approval workflows - helping documentation managers ensure consistency, completeness, and quality across large documentation sets maintained by multiple teams.

## Persona Description
Carlos oversees documentation for a complex software suite with multiple integrated products. He needs to ensure consistency across documentation created by different teams while identifying gaps and redundancies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cross-Reference Visualization**
   - Generate visual representations of connections between components, APIs, and documentation sections
   - Critical for Carlos because understanding relationships between components helps identify integration points and dependencies that need special documentation attention
   - Must map documentation sections to code components, APIs, and other documentation
   - Should calculate and display connection strength between related items
   - Must identify orphaned documentation with no clear connections to other components
   - Should provide both graphical and tabular representations of relationships

2. **Documentation Coverage Analysis**
   - Identify undocumented or inadequately documented features, APIs, or components
   - Essential for Carlos to ensure completeness of documentation across the entire software suite
   - Must compare code base against documentation corpus to find mismatches
   - Should calculate coverage scores at multiple levels (component, module, function, parameter)
   - Must prioritize coverage gaps based on component usage and criticality
   - Should track coverage metrics over time to identify regressions

3. **Style and Terminology Enforcement**
   - Enforce consistent language, terminology, and writing style across all documentation
   - Vital for Carlos to maintain a unified user experience despite documentation being created by different teams
   - Must validate documentation against customizable style guides and terminology dictionaries
   - Should provide correction suggestions for style and terminology violations
   - Must support organization-specific terminology and style rules
   - Should generate detailed reports of consistency issues by document and author

4. **Workload Allocation Tools**
   - Distribute documentation tasks based on team member expertise, capacity, and component familiarity
   - Critical for Carlos to efficiently manage documentation resources across multiple products and teams
   - Must analyze task complexity and estimate effort required
   - Should match task requirements with author expertise profiles
   - Must track task progress and deadlines
   - Should balance workload across available resources

5. **Stakeholder Approval Workflows**
   - Track review status and sign-offs for documentation requiring multiple approvals
   - Essential for Carlos to manage the complex review process involving technical teams, product management, and legal review
   - Must support configurable approval chains with dependencies
   - Should notify relevant stakeholders of pending approvals
   - Must maintain complete audit trails of the approval process
   - Should escalate stalled approvals based on configurable rules

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have pytest test suites with at least 90% code coverage
- Cross-reference visualization must be testable with structured mock documentation
- Coverage analysis must be verifiable against known documentation gaps
- Style enforcement must be tested against custom rule sets
- Workload allocation must be testable with simulated team profiles
- Approval workflows must be verifiable with mock stakeholder interactions

### Performance Expectations
- System must analyze documentation corpora up to 10GB in size
- Cross-reference analysis must complete within 5 minutes for large documentation sets
- Coverage analysis must process 1,000 code files per minute
- Style validation must check 100 pages per second
- Workload allocation must optimize assignments for teams of up to 50 members
- Approval tracking must handle 1,000 concurrent approval processes

### Integration Points
- Version control systems for documentation and code base access
- Issue tracking systems for workflow management
- Team management systems for expertise and capacity data
- Email and notification systems for alerts and reminders
- Database systems for storing relationship and coverage data
- Reporting systems for generating management dashboards

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without a UI component
- The system must respect access control restrictions on documentation and code
- Analysis must work without modifying existing documentation formats
- The solution must not impact performance of production documentation systems
- Must support multiple documentation formats (Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, etc.)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Documentation Suite Orchestrator should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Documentation and Code Analysis**
   - Parse and index documentation in multiple formats
   - Analyze code bases to extract API structures, component relationships, and function signatures
   - Identify cross-references and dependencies between components
   - Detect changes between documentation and code versions

2. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Build relationship graphs between documentation elements
   - Calculate connection strength and importance
   - Identify documentation clusters and isolated components
   - Generate visualization data for relationship networks

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Compare documentation against code base for completeness
   - Validate content against style and terminology rules
   - Calculate quality metrics for documentation components
   - Track documentation health over time

4. **Workflow Management**
   - Analyze task requirements and complexity
   - Match tasks to appropriate resources based on expertise
   - Track task progress and manage dependencies
   - Allocate resources to maximize efficiency and quality

5. **Approval and Governance**
   - Implement configurable approval workflows
   - Track approval status and manage notifications
   - Generate audit trails of review processes
   - Enforce governance policies for documentation release

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate identification of cross-references between documentation components
- Correct calculation of documentation coverage metrics
- Precise detection of style and terminology violations
- Optimal allocation of tasks based on expertise and capacity
- Proper management of complex approval workflows

### Critical User Scenarios
- A documentation manager identifies gaps in API documentation across multiple products
- A team lead receives optimal task allocations for team members based on expertise
- A reviewer is notified of pending approvals with priorities and deadlines
- A documentation author receives automatic style and terminology corrections
- A product manager views cross-references between components to identify integration documentation needs

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process documentation corpus of 10GB in under 10 minutes

- Integration tests for all external system connectors
- Performance tests for all operations at scale
- Workflow tests for all approval scenarios

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details

# Lint code
uv run ruff check .
```

When implementing this project, focus on creating modular, well-documented Python libraries that can be easily tested and integrated into various documentation workflows. The implementation should follow best practices for Python development including proper type hints, comprehensive docstrings, and adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.
