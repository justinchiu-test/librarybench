# Multi-Cloud Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for cloud infrastructure engineers managing multi-cloud environments. This system centralizes, correlates, and analyzes logs from diverse cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), providing rapid diagnostics for complex service dependencies and infrastructure-wide issues.

## Persona Description
Amit manages a multi-cloud infrastructure spanning thousands of servers and microservices. He needs to centralize and analyze logs from diverse cloud platforms to ensure system reliability and quickly diagnose issues across complex service dependencies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Provider Integration**
   - Implement specialized parsers for AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging
   - Support extraction of standardized fields across different cloud log formats
   - Enable configurable API-based log retrieval with appropriate authentication methods
   - Handle rate limiting and pagination from cloud provider APIs
   - Support real-time streaming and batch processing of cloud logs
   
   *This feature is critical for Amit because managing logs from multiple cloud providers requires normalized data structures to enable cross-platform analysis and avoid maintaining separate tooling for each provider.*

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Correlation**
   - Link log events to specific infrastructure deployment changes
   - Parse and interpret Terraform, CloudFormation, and other IaC templates
   - Maintain a timeline of infrastructure changes with associated resource identifiers
   - Provide bidirectional lookups between resources and their deployment history
   - Enable filtering of logs by deployment, change set, or infrastructure component
   
   *This feature is essential as it allows Amit to quickly determine whether infrastructure changes are causing observed issues, significantly reducing root cause analysis time for post-deployment problems.*

3. **Service Dependency Visualization**
   - Generate directed graphs of service dependencies based on log traffic patterns
   - Highlight cascading failures across the infrastructure
   - Provide drill-down capabilities from high-level service maps to specific log entries
   - Calculate impact radius for specific service disruptions
   - Support dynamic updating of dependency maps as new interaction patterns emerge
   
   *Visualizing service dependencies is crucial because in complex microservice architectures, understanding the ripple effect of failures requires clear insight into how services interact, helping Amit prioritize incident responses based on potential downstream impacts.*

4. **Auto-scaling Event Detection**
   - Identify resource provisioning patterns and bottlenecks
   - Correlate scaling events with performance metrics and error rates
   - Detect anomalous scaling behavior indicating misconfiguration
   - Provide historical context for capacity planning
   - Track scaling lag times and provisioning failures
   
   *This feature is vital because cloud cost optimization and performance reliability depend on proper auto-scaling behavior, and detecting issues in scaling configurations before they impact service availability is a primary responsibility for Amit.*

5. **Cost Attribution Tagging**
   - Connect high-volume logging with specific services for cost optimization
   - Parse and normalize cost-related information across cloud platforms
   - Generate reports mapping log volume to resource costs
   - Provide recommendations for log verbosity adjustments
   - Track cost trends over time by service and resource type
   
   *Cost management is essential since logging can constitute a significant portion of cloud expenses, and proper attribution helps Amit optimize verbosity levels appropriately for different services based on their criticality and budget constraints.*

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be tested in isolation using mocked cloud provider APIs
- Integration tests must utilize cloud provider emulators where available
- Log parsers must be validated against samples of actual cloud provider logs
- Tests must cover error handling for API failures, rate limiting, and malformed logs
- Performance tests must verify processing capacity for peak log volumes

### Performance Expectations
- Support for processing at least 10,000 log entries per second
- API response time for queries under 500ms for typical analysis operations
- Support for datasets containing up to 30 days of log history (approximately 1TB)
- Efficient memory usage when processing large log volumes
- Parallelized processing of logs from different cloud providers

### Integration Points
- Cloud provider API interfaces for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Common IaC tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
- Cost management APIs for the major cloud providers
- Standard output formats (JSON, CSV) for export to other systems
- Support for webhook notifications for detected anomalies

### Key Constraints
- No direct database dependencies; storage should be file-based or use object storage
- Minimal external dependencies to simplify deployment
- All sensitive credentials must be securely handled
- Processing must be restartable in case of interruption
- No UI/UX components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Multi-Cloud Log Analysis Framework must provide the following core capabilities:

1. **Log Acquisition System**
   - Retrieve logs from cloud provider APIs (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Logging)
   - Support both historical retrieval and real-time streaming
   - Handle authentication and rate limiting appropriately
   - Normalize logs into a consistent internal format

2. **Cloud-Specific Parser Subsystem**
   - Parse diverse log formats from different cloud services
   - Extract standard fields (timestamp, resource ID, event type, etc.)
   - Normalize service-specific fields into comparable formats
   - Handle special case formats like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity logs, and GCP Audit logs

3. **Infrastructure Change Tracking**
   - Parse IaC templates and deployment logs
   - Maintain a timeline of infrastructure changes
   - Link resources mentioned in logs to their deployment history
   - Provide APIs to query relationships between infrastructure changes and log events

4. **Service Dependency Analysis**
   - Build service maps based on log interaction patterns
   - Calculate statistical measures of inter-service dependencies
   - Detect communication patterns and failure cascades
   - Provide programmatic access to dependency information

5. **Cost and Performance Analytics**
   - Track log volumes by service, region, and resource
   - Correlate log verbosity with associated costs
   - Analyze auto-scaling events and their impact
   - Generate cost attribution reports and recommendations
