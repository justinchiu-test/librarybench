# Multi-Cloud Log Analysis Framework

A specialized log analysis framework designed for cloud infrastructure engineers managing complex multi-cloud environments.

## Overview

This project implements a robust log analysis system tailored specifically for cloud infrastructure environments spanning AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It centralizes logs from diverse cloud services, correlates them with infrastructure changes, visualizes service dependencies, monitors auto-scaling events, and provides cost attribution for optimization.

## Persona Description

Amit manages a multi-cloud infrastructure spanning thousands of servers and microservices. He needs to centralize and analyze logs from diverse cloud platforms to ensure system reliability and quickly diagnose issues across complex service dependencies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Provider Integration**
   - Implement specialized parsers for AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging
   - Essential for Amit because he needs to unify log formats from different cloud providers to create a centralized view of system behavior across his multi-cloud environment
   - Must support AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, GCP Audit Logs, and other cloud-specific log formats

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Correlation**
   - Create a system that links log events to specific deployment changes in IaC tools
   - Critical for Amit to trace issues back to infrastructure changes and understand the impact of deployments across cloud environments
   - Must correlate logs with Terraform state changes, CloudFormation stack updates, or other IaC tool events

3. **Service Dependency Visualization**
   - Develop functionality to map relationships between services and highlight cascading failures
   - Essential for Amit to understand the ripple effects when issues occur in interconnected microservices architectures
   - Should identify primary failure points versus secondary effects to prioritize remediation

4. **Auto-scaling Event Detection**
   - Build detection algorithms for resource provisioning patterns and bottlenecks
   - Important for Amit to identify scaling issues, triggering conditions, and provisioning bottlenecks
   - Must detect scaling events across different providers and correlate them with system load metrics

5. **Cost Attribution Tagging**
   - Implement a system to connect high-volume logging with specific services for optimization
   - Necessary for Amit to identify which services are generating excessive logs and driving up cloud logging costs
   - Should tag and categorize log volumes by service, team, and environment to enable cost allocation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All code must have comprehensive pytest-based tests with at least 85% code coverage
- Integration tests must use mock cloud provider APIs to simulate various log formats and scenarios
- Tests must validate correct parsing of all supported cloud provider log formats
- Mocks and fixtures must simulate large-scale log volumes (>100k events) for performance testing

### Performance Expectations
- Must process at least 10,000 log entries per second on standard hardware
- Should handle bursts of up to 100,000 log entries without significant delay
- Parser efficiency should enable real-time processing of logs from at least 5,000 cloud resources
- Memory consumption should remain stable regardless of the volume of logs processed

### Integration Points
- Support for AWS CloudWatch Logs API, Azure Monitor API, and Google Cloud Logging API
- Integration with common IaC tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) for change tracking
- Optional output to time-series databases for long-term trend analysis
- Support for log exporting to S3/Blob Storage/GCS for archival purposes

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without requiring administrative access to cloud platforms (read-only API access)
- Should work with standard log retention periods without requiring extended retention in cloud services
- Implementation should remain vendor-neutral with modular adapters for each cloud provider
- Parse cloud-specific timestamps correctly and normalize to UTC for cross-cloud correlation

## Core Functionality

The system must implement these core capabilities:

1. **Log Ingestion & Normalization Engine**
   - Collect logs from multiple cloud providers through their respective APIs
   - Normalize diverse log formats into a consistent internal data model
   - Batch processing capabilities for historical analysis
   - Streaming capabilities for real-time monitoring

2. **Cloud Resource Mapper**
   - Build and maintain a graph of cloud resources and their relationships
   - Update the resource map based on infrastructure change events
   - Trace dependencies between resources across cloud provider boundaries
   - Tag resources with metadata for categorization and filtering

3. **Event Correlation Engine**
   - Match log events with infrastructure changes
   - Detect patterns across log streams from different providers
   - Identify causal relationships between events
   - Group related events into incidents

4. **Analysis & Alerting System**
   - Detect abnormal behavior based on historical patterns
   - Alert on cascading failures across service boundaries
   - Monitor auto-scaling events and resource provisioning
   - Track cost and volume metrics for logging activities

5. **Reporting API**
   - Generate infrastructure health reports
   - Provide cost attribution data by service/team
   - Expose scaling efficiency metrics
   - Create dependency graphs for visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify

- **Parser Accuracy**: Verify correct parsing of all supported cloud provider log formats
- **Correlation Logic**: Ensure infrastructure changes are correctly linked to observed log events
- **Dependency Mapping**: Validate accurate relationship mapping between cloud resources
- **Scaling Detection**: Confirm accurate identification of auto-scaling events and patterns
- **Cost Attribution**: Verify accurate tracking and attribution of log volumes to services

### Critical User Scenarios

- Processing logs during a multi-service outage to identify the root cause
- Analyzing logs after a major infrastructure deployment to detect unexpected changes
- Monitoring auto-scaling behavior during traffic spikes to identify bottlenecks
- Attributing logging costs across teams and services for chargeback
- Tracing the impact of a failed service on dependent components

### Performance Benchmarks

- Parse and normalize at least 10,000 logs per second from mixed cloud sources
- Complete dependency analysis for 1,000+ interconnected services in under 60 seconds
- Generate cost attribution reports for 100+ services in under 30 seconds
- Process 30 days of historical logs for trend analysis in under 10 minutes
- Maintain memory usage below 1GB during sustained processing

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Gracefully handle malformed log entries without failing the entire processing pipeline
- Manage API rate limiting from cloud providers without losing data
- Handle intermittent connectivity to cloud provider APIs with appropriate retry logic
- Process logs with missing fields or non-standard formats
- Correctly handle clock drift between different cloud providers

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 85% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage for parser and normalization logic
- 100% coverage for correlation algorithms
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must cover both steady-state and burst scenarios

## Success Criteria

The implementation meets Amit's needs when it can:

1. Successfully parse and normalize logs from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud in a single unified view
2. Accurately correlate infrastructure changes with related log events across cloud providers
3. Visualize service dependencies and accurately identify the root cause of cascading failures
4. Detect auto-scaling issues and bottlenecks before they impact service availability
5. Provide accurate cost attribution for logging by service, enabling optimization decisions
6. Process logs at scale (10k+ per second) without performance degradation
7. Reduce mean time to resolution for multi-cloud incidents by at least 50%

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment and start working on this project:

1. Initialize a new Python library project using uv:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Run specific tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest tests/test_cloud_parser.py::test_aws_cloudwatch_parser
   ```

5. Run your code:
   ```
   uv run python examples/process_aws_logs.py
   ```

Remember that all functionality should be implemented as importable Python modules with well-defined APIs, not as user-facing applications.
