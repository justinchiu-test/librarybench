# Cloud-Native Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for cloud infrastructure engineers managing multi-cloud environments. This system provides centralized log collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platforms, enabling quick diagnosis of issues in complex service dependencies and correlation with infrastructure changes.

## Persona Description
Amit manages a multi-cloud infrastructure spanning thousands of servers and microservices. He needs to centralize and analyze logs from diverse cloud platforms to ensure system reliability and quickly diagnose issues across complex service dependencies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Provider Integration**
   - Specialized parsers for AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging
   - Support for different authentication methods and API limits for each cloud provider
   - Standardized format conversion to normalize logs from different platforms
   - This feature is critical because Amit must consolidate logs from multiple cloud environments to have a unified view of the entire infrastructure.

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Correlation**
   - Link log events to specific deployment changes in tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Pulumi
   - Map resource identifiers in logs to their IaC definitions
   - Timeline view of infrastructure changes alongside related log events
   - This feature is essential because it allows Amit to quickly determine if recent infrastructure changes contributed to observed issues.

3. **Service Dependency Visualization**
   - Identify and display cascading failures across interconnected services
   - Automatically generate service dependency maps based on log communication patterns
   - Highlight critical path services with the highest impact on overall system reliability
   - This feature is vital because complex microservice architectures make it difficult to manually trace failure propagation across dependent services.

4. **Auto-scaling Event Detection**
   - Identify patterns related to resource provisioning across cloud platforms
   - Detect bottlenecks in scaling operations including launch times and resource allocation
   - Correlate auto-scaling events with system load metrics and application performance
   - This feature is important because efficient auto-scaling is critical for balancing performance and cost in cloud environments.

5. **Cost Attribution Tagging**
   - Connect high-volume logging with specific services for optimization
   - Track and report log storage and processing costs by service, team, or application
   - Identify cost anomalies and recommend log verbosity adjustments
   - This feature is necessary because cloud logging costs can become significant, and Amit needs to optimize logging practices while maintaining observability.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must validate correct parsing and normalization of logs from different cloud providers
- Performance tests must verify the system can handle at least 10,000 log entries per second
- Mock cloud provider APIs must be used for testing to avoid actual cloud costs during development

### Performance Expectations
- Log ingestion must support bursts of up to 50,000 log entries per second
- Query response time must be under 2 seconds for typical analysis operations
- The system must efficiently handle at least 1TB of historical log data
- Memory consumption should not exceed 2GB during normal operation

### Integration Points
- Cloud provider API integration for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Infrastructure-as-Code tool integration (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
- Support for standard log formats (JSON, SYSLOG) and cloud-specific formats
- Export capabilities to common visualization and alerting tools

### Key Constraints
- Must function without requiring admin/owner permissions in cloud environments
- Should minimize egress costs when retrieving logs from cloud providers
- Must operate without persistent connections to cloud services
- Should function even when one or more cloud providers have API outages

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the Cloud-Native Log Analysis Framework includes:

1. **Log Collection and Normalization**
   - Cloud provider-specific log collectors that respect rate limits and pagination
   - Normalization engine to transform cloud-specific formats into a standardized internal format
   - Efficient storage and indexing of collected logs with cloud resource identifiers

2. **Analysis and Correlation Engine**
   - Pattern recognition to identify common infrastructure events across cloud providers
   - Correlation algorithms to link logs with infrastructure changes
   - Service dependency mapping based on log communication patterns
   - Auto-scaling event analysis for resource provisioning optimization

3. **Insight Generation**
   - Anomaly detection for unusual infrastructure behavior
   - Failure cascade analysis to trace issue propagation
   - Cost attribution and optimization recommendations
   - Performance bottleneck identification

4. **API and Integration Layer**
   - Well-defined API for programmatic access to all functionality
   - Extensible plugin system for adding new cloud providers or IaC tools
   - Export capabilities for integration with external systems

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct parsing of AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging formats
- Accurate correlation between log events and infrastructure changes
- Proper identification of service dependencies and failure cascades
- Reliable detection of auto-scaling events and associated patterns
- Accurate attribution of logging costs to specific services

### Critical User Scenarios
- Diagnosing a service outage across multiple cloud platforms
- Correlating a performance degradation with recent infrastructure changes
- Optimizing logging costs without sacrificing observability
- Identifying bottlenecks in auto-scaling operations during traffic spikes
- Tracing failure propagation across service dependencies

### Performance Benchmarks
- Log ingestion rate: Minimum 10,000 log entries per second sustained
- Query performance: Filtering and aggregating 1 million log entries in under 5 seconds
- Memory efficiency: Process 100,000 log entries using less than 1GB of RAM
- Storage efficiency: Store 1 million log entries using less than 500MB of disk space

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling partial cloud provider API outages
- Managing corrupted or malformed log entries
- Dealing with clock skew between different cloud environments
- Handling rate limiting and throttling from cloud provider APIs
- Processing logs during and after network connectivity issues

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of cloud provider integration code
- All error handling code paths must be tested
- All data normalization logic must be fully tested

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It can correctly parse and normalize logs from all three major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. It accurately correlates log events with infrastructure changes
3. It correctly identifies service dependencies and visualizes failure cascades
4. It reliably detects and analyzes auto-scaling events
5. It provides accurate cost attribution for log volume by service
6. Performance benchmarks for log ingestion, query response, and resource utilization are met
7. All edge cases and error conditions are handled gracefully
8. The API is well-documented and follows consistent design patterns

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona
