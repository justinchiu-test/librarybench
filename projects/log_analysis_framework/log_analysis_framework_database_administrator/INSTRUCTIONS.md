# Database Performance Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for database administrators managing large-scale database clusters. The system focuses on query performance analysis, lock contention visualization, index usage optimization, storage growth prediction, and replication health monitoring to ensure optimal database performance and reliability.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen manages large-scale database clusters supporting critical business applications. She needs to monitor query performance, resource utilization, and identify optimization opportunities across different database technologies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Query Performance Analysis**
   - Extract and analyze execution plans from database logs
   - Identify bottlenecks in query processing and execution
   - Track query performance trends over time
   - Correlate slow queries with database load and system resources
   - Categorize queries by complexity, table access patterns, and resource usage
   
   *This feature is critical for Dr. Chen because query optimization is often the most effective way to improve overall database performance, and systematic analysis of execution plans helps pinpoint specific inefficiencies that might otherwise remain hidden.*

2. **Lock Contention Visualization**
   - Detect and analyze transaction blocking patterns
   - Identify deadlocks and their root causes
   - Track lock acquisition times and durations
   - Map relationships between blocking and blocked transactions
   - Measure impact of lock contention on overall throughput
   
   *Understanding lock contention is essential since concurrent access conflicts can severely impact application performance and user experience, particularly during peak loads, and visualization makes these complex interaction patterns comprehensible for Dr. Chen.*

3. **Index Usage Statistics**
   - Track which indexes are being used by queries
   - Identify redundant, unused, or underutilized indexes
   - Suggest potential missing indexes based on query patterns
   - Calculate maintenance overhead of existing indexes
   - Monitor index fragmentation and rebuilding activities
   
   *Index optimization is vital because appropriate indexing dramatically impacts query performance, but excess indexes waste storage and slow write operations, making systematic analysis of index usage essential for Dr. Chen to make informed optimization decisions.*

4. **Storage Growth Prediction**
   - Analyze historical patterns of database growth by table and schema
   - Project future storage requirements based on trends
   - Identify tables with abnormal growth patterns
   - Track impact of data archiving and purging activities
   - Correlate growth with application activities and user patterns
   
   *Proactive storage management is crucial since unexpected storage exhaustion can cause critical outages, and accurate growth prediction helps Dr. Chen plan capacity upgrades and implement data lifecycle policies before space becomes a problem.*

5. **Replication Lag Monitoring**
   - Track synchronization delays between primary and replica databases
   - Identify root causes for replication lag
   - Correlate lag with system load, network issues, or query patterns
   - Predict potential replication failures based on trend analysis
   - Monitor consistency of data across the replication topology
   
   *Replication health is essential for maintaining high availability and disaster recovery capabilities, and comprehensive lag monitoring helps Dr. Chen ensure that replicas remain within acceptable synchronization parameters to support failover requirements.*

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Query analysis algorithms must be testable with standardized SQL log datasets
- Lock detection must validate against known contention scenarios
- Index usage analysis requires test datasets with varied query access patterns
- Storage prediction algorithms need validation against historical growth data
- Replication monitoring must be testable with simulated lag scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Process and analyze at least 1 million query log entries per hour
- Generate insights and reports with latency under 3 seconds
- Support for concurrent analysis of at least 100 database instances
- Handle historical datasets spanning at least 1 year of log data
- Efficient processing of both streaming and batch log sources

### Integration Points
- Multiple database engine log formats (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB)
- Database system tables and performance views
- Server resource monitoring metrics
- Backup and recovery logs
- Schema migration and change management systems

### Key Constraints
- No direct connection to production databases for analysis
- Minimal impact on monitored systems
- Processing must handle log rotation and archiving
- Support for diverse log formats from different database engines
- All functionality exposed through Python APIs without UI requirements

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

   - Support both real-time and historical log analysis

2. **Query Performance Analyzer**
   - Parse and interpret execution plans
   - Identify performance bottlenecks (sequential scans, missing indexes, etc.)
   - Track query execution statistics over time
   - Group and categorize similar queries
   - Provide optimization recommendations

3. **Transaction and Lock Manager**
   - Track lock acquisitions and releases
   - Detect blocking chains and deadlocks
   - Calculate lock wait times and impact
   - Model transaction interdependencies
   - Provide insights into concurrency issues

4. **Index Analysis Subsystem**
   - Monitor index usage frequencies
   - Track index scan vs. seek operations
   - Identify potentially missing indexes
