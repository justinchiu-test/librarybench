# IoT Fleet Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for industrial IoT fleet managers to monitor device health, analyze connectivity patterns, detect anomalies, track sensor calibration, and visualize deployment status across manufacturing facilities. The system enables reliable fleet management and predictive maintenance of diverse IoT devices.

## Persona Description
Carlos oversees a network of industrial IoT devices deployed across manufacturing facilities. He needs to monitor device health, update status, and troubleshoot connectivity issues across a diverse hardware ecosystem.

## Key Requirements

1. **Device Lifecycle Tracking**
   - Show firmware versions and update history across the fleet
   - Monitor device provisioning, commissioning, and decommissioning
   - Track operational hours and maintenance history
   - Document hardware configurations and component replacements
   - Provide device-specific audit trails for compliance purposes
   
   *This feature is critical for Carlos because managing hundreds or thousands of IoT devices requires systematic tracking of their status and history, enabling him to maintain consistent firmware versions, plan update campaigns, and manage the complete device lifecycle from deployment to retirement.*

2. **Connectivity Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify environmental factors affecting device reliability
   - Map connection stability across physical locations
   - Detect interference patterns and communication bottlenecks
   - Track bandwidth usage and protocol performance
   - Generate insights on network optimization opportunities
   
   *Understanding connectivity patterns is essential since industrial environments often present challenging conditions for wireless communications, and pattern analysis helps Carlos identify problematic areas and environmental factors that affect device reliability before they cause production issues.*

3. **Power Consumption Anomaly Detection**
   - Highlight potential hardware failures through power usage patterns
   - Establish power consumption baselines by device type and environment
   - Detect deviations indicating malfunction or deterioration
   - Predict battery life for portable devices
   - Identify energy optimization opportunities
   
   *Power consumption monitoring is crucial because abnormal energy usage often precedes complete device failure, and early detection allows Carlos to schedule preventive maintenance during planned production downtimes rather than responding to emergency outages.*

4. **Sensor Calibration Drift Monitoring**
   - Compare readings against expected baselines over time
   - Detect gradual sensor degradation and calibration issues
   - Track environmental factors affecting measurement accuracy
   - Schedule recalibration based on drift patterns
   - Ensure measurement consistency across the device fleet
   
   *Sensor calibration monitoring is vital since manufacturing quality depends on accurate measurements, and systematic tracking of drift patterns helps Carlos maintain measurement integrity and schedule calibration activities before inaccuracies affect production quality.*

5. **Geospatial Deployment Visualization**
   - Map device status across physical locations in manufacturing facilities
   - Visualize connectivity, health, and performance metrics geographically
   - Identify location-specific patterns and issues
   - Support zone-based filtering and analysis
   - Track device movements and redeployments
   
   *Geospatial visualization is important because understanding the physical context of devices helps Carlos identify location-specific issues, manage deployment density, and efficiently dispatch maintenance personnel to the right locations when problems occur.*

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Device lifecycle tracking must be testable with simulated device histories
- Connectivity analysis requires datasets with diverse network conditions
