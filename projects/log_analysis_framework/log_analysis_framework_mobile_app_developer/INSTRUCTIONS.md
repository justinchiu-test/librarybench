# Mobile App Log Analysis Framework

A specialized log analysis framework designed for mobile application developers to track crashes, performance, and user behavior.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive log analysis system tailored for mobile application developers. It provides crash analysis, user journey tracking, device-specific issue detection, performance monitoring, and feature adoption analytics to help prioritize bug fixes and improve the mobile app experience.

## Persona Description

Miguel is responsible for a consumer mobile application with millions of users. He needs to understand app crash patterns, performance issues, and user behavior to prioritize bug fixes and improvements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Crash Stack Deduplication**
   - Implement functionality to group similar errors to identify the most impactful issues
   - Critical for Miguel to prioritize bug fixes by understanding which crashes affect the most users
   - Must analyze stack traces to identify root causes despite minor variations in exact crash locations
   - Should provide frequency analysis and impact scoring for each unique crash pattern

2. **User Journey Reconstruction**
   - Create a system to show exact steps leading up to app failures
   - Essential for Miguel to reproduce issues by understanding the sequence of actions that trigger crashes
   - Should reconstruct the sequence of screens, user interactions, and state changes before a crash
   - Must handle both immediate crash triggers and cumulative conditions that build up over time

3. **Device and OS Version Correlation**
   - Develop analysis capabilities to identify platform-specific problems
   - Necessary for Miguel to determine if issues are isolated to specific devices, OS versions, or hardware configurations
   - Should detect patterns like "crash only happens on iOS 16.2 on iPhone 12" or "performance degrades on Android 11 devices with <4GB RAM"
   - Must provide statistical distribution of issues across the device/OS landscape

4. **Performance Regression Detection**
   - Build comparative analysis to identify metrics degradation before and after releases
   - Vital for Miguel to catch performance issues introduced in new versions before they affect the entire user base
   - Should track key metrics like startup time, frame rate, memory usage, and battery consumption
   - Must automatically detect statistically significant regressions between app versions

5. **Feature Adoption Tracking**
   - Implement analytics to show usage patterns of new app capabilities
   - Important for Miguel to understand which features are being discovered and used by customers
   - Should track first use, repeat usage, and abandonment patterns for specific features
   - Must correlate feature usage with user segments and app versions

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functionality must be testable via pytest with appropriate fixtures and mocks
- Tests must validate correct parsing of mobile crash logs from both iOS and Android
- Performance analysis algorithms must be verifiable with synthetic data
- Test coverage should exceed 85% for all modules
- Tests must verify correct association of logs with device information and app versions

### Performance Expectations
- Must process logs from applications with 1M+ daily active users
- Should parse and analyze up to 10,000 crash reports per hour during peak periods
- Analysis operations should complete within seconds even with large historical datasets
- Should support processing both real-time streams and historical batch analysis

### Integration Points
- Compatible with crash reporting from both iOS and Android platforms
- Support for common mobile analytics frameworks (Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automatic performance regression testing
- Optional integration with issue tracking systems (Jira, GitHub Issues)

### Key Constraints
- Must handle incomplete crash reports that may be truncated or missing data
- Should work with anonymized user data while still enabling journey tracking
- Implementation should minimize mobile SDK size and performance impact
- Must support offline log collection and later synchronization

## Core Functionality

The system must implement these core capabilities:

1. **Crash Log Processor**
   - Parse crash reports from iOS and Android platforms
   - Normalize stack traces for comparison and deduplication
   - Extract relevant device information and app state
   - Classify crashes by type, component, and severity

2. **User Journey Analyzer**
   - Reconstruct screen flows and user interactions
   - Map user actions to application state changes
   - Identify patterns leading to failures
   - Correlate journeys with user segments

3. **Device Compatibility Analyzer**
   - Track issues by device model, OS version, and hardware capabilities
   - Identify platform-specific patterns in crashes and performance
   - Generate compatibility matrices for different app features
   - Detect minimum viable specifications for optimal performance

4. **Performance Metrics Engine**
   - Track key performance indicators across app versions
   - Detect regressions using statistical analysis
   - Benchmark performance across different device categories
   - Identify resource-intensive operations

5. **Feature Usage Tracker**
   - Monitor feature discovery and adoption
   - Analyze usage patterns and engagement metrics
   - Track feature abandonment and completion rates
   - Compare adoption across different user segments

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify

- **Crash Deduplication**: Verify correct grouping of similar crashes despite minor stack trace variations
- **User Journey Analysis**: Confirm accurate reconstruction of steps leading to crashes
- **Device Correlation**: Validate correct identification of device-specific issues
- **Performance Analysis**: Ensure accurate detection of performance regressions between versions
- **Feature Tracking**: Verify correct measurement of feature adoption and usage patterns

### Critical User Scenarios

- Analyzing a sudden spike in crashes after a new release
- Investigating a performance issue reported only on specific device models
- Troubleshooting a crash that occurs only after a specific sequence of actions
- Monitoring adoption of a newly released feature across different user segments
- Comparing performance metrics before and after a major code refactoring

### Performance Benchmarks

- Process and deduplicate 1,000 new crash reports in under 30 seconds
- Reconstruct user journeys for 100 crash instances in under 15 seconds
- Generate device compatibility matrix across 500+ device types in under 60 seconds
- Compare performance metrics across 5 app versions with 1M+ data points in under 2 minutes
- Process feature usage data for 100k daily active users in near real-time (< 5 minute delay)

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle malformed or truncated crash reports without system failure
- Process incomplete user journeys with partial information
- Manage device data from unknown or custom device models
- Handle statistical outliers in performance data without skewing results
- Process logs from development, testing, and production environments without cross-contamination

### Test Coverage Requirements

- 90% coverage for crash parsing and deduplication logic
- 85% coverage for user journey reconstruction
- 85% coverage for device correlation algorithms
- 90% coverage for performance regression detection
- 85% coverage for feature usage analytics
- 85% overall code coverage

## Success Criteria

The implementation meets Miguel's needs when it can:

1. Automatically group similar crashes with >95% accuracy, reducing investigation time by at least 60%
2. Reconstruct the exact sequence of steps leading to at least 80% of crashes
3. Correctly identify device and OS-specific issues with >90% accuracy
4. Detect performance regressions between app versions with <5% false positives
5. Provide accurate adoption metrics for new features with breakdown by user segments
6. Process logs from 1M+ daily active users without performance degradation
7. Reduce time to identify root causes of major issues by at least 50%

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment and start working on this project:

1. Initialize a new Python library project using uv:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Run specific tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest tests/test_crash_deduplication.py
   ```

5. Run your code:
   ```
   uv run python examples/analyze_crash_reports.py
   ```

Remember that all functionality should be implemented as importable Python modules with well-defined APIs, not as user-facing applications.
