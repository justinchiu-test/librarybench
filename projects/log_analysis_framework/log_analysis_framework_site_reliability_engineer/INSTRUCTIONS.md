# SRE-Focused Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for Site Reliability Engineers to monitor service level objectives, correlate system metrics with log events, track error budgets, automate remediation, and support incident management workflows to ensure high reliability of critical SaaS platforms.

## Persona Description
Priya maintains service level objectives (SLOs) for a critical SaaS platform. She needs to correlate logs with system metrics to identify reliability issues before they impact customers and automate remediation responses.

## Key Requirements

1. **SLO Impact Analysis**
   - Automatically correlate log events with service level objective violations
   - Calculate impact of incidents on reliability metrics
   - Identify leading indicators before SLO breaches occur
   - Categorize issues by affected SLO dimensions (availability, latency, etc.)
   - Provide real-time visibility into service health relative to objectives
   
   *This feature is critical for Priya because SLOs define the contractual reliability promises to customers, and understanding which systems or events are causing degradation allows her to prioritize work that will have the greatest impact on improving service reliability.*

2. **Error Budget Tracking**
   - Show reliability metric consumption over time with forecasting
   - Calculate remaining error budget by service and SLO category
   - Project when error budgets will be exhausted based on current trends
   - Track budget consumption by incident, component, and team
   - Provide burn rate alerts when consumption accelerates
   
   *Error budget management is essential since it balances reliability work against feature development, and accurate tracking helps Priya make data-driven decisions about when to prioritize stability improvements over new functionality.*

3. **Automated Remediation Rule Creation**
   - Generate suggested remediation actions based on historical resolution patterns
   - Identify common failure scenarios amenable to automation
   - Create and test automated recovery procedures
   - Track success rates of automated remediation attempts
   - Support continuous improvement of automation rules
   
   *Automated remediation is vital because rapid recovery from known issues directly improves service availability, and rule generation based on past successes helps Priya systematically reduce toil and mean-time-to-recovery for recurring problems.*

4. **Incident Response Timeline Reconstruction**
   - Generate detailed event sequences for postmortem analysis
   - Correlate actions, alerts, and system changes during incidents
   - Measure response times between stages of incident handling
   - Capture communication and decision points
   - Support learning and process improvement after incidents
   
   *Detailed incident timelines are crucial for effective postmortems, helping Priya analyze what happened, improve response procedures, and prevent similar incidents in the future by understanding the complete sequence of events leading to and during service disruptions.*

5. **On-call Rotation Integration**
   - Direct alerts to the appropriate team member with contextual information
   - Track alert frequency, acknowledgment times, and resolution metrics
   - Manage escalation paths based on incident severity and response times
   - Provide historical context from similar previous incidents
   - Balance on-call load across team members
   
   *On-call management is essential because effective incident response requires routing alerts to the right engineers with appropriate context, and integration with rotation schedules helps Priya ensure timely responses while preventing responder fatigue.*

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- SLO impact analysis must be testable with simulated service metrics
- Error budget calculations require historical test datasets
- Remediation rule generation needs reproducible incident scenarios
- Timeline reconstruction must be verifiable with known event sequences
- On-call integration requires simulated alert and notification testing

### Performance Expectations
- Process and analyze at least 5,000 log entries per second
- Calculate SLO impacts with latency under 30 seconds
- Support analysis across at least 100 microservices
- Maintain at least 90 days of historical incident data
- Generate reports and insights with latency under 5 seconds

### Integration Points
- Monitoring and observability platforms (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)
- Alerting and on-call management systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)
- Incident management tools
- CI/CD pipelines for deployment correlation

- Automation and orchestration frameworks

### Key Constraints
- No direct production system modifications from analysis system
- Minimal performance impact on monitored systems
- Support for distributed tracing correlation
- Secure handling of sensitive operational data
- All functionality exposed through Python APIs without UI requirements

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The SRE-Focused Log Analysis Framework must provide the following core capabilities:

1. **Log and Metric Integration**
   - Ingest and correlate logs from multiple systems and services
   - Import metrics related to SLOs and service performance
   - Normalize timestamps and identifiers across data sources
   - Support distributed tracing correlation
   - Create unified view of system behavior

2. **SLO Monitoring and Analysis**
   - Calculate current SLO performance against targets
   - Identify events and patterns affecting reliability
   - Detect anomalies that may impact service levels
   - Correlate service degradations with specific components
   - Generate alerts when SLO violations are predicted

3. **Error Budget Management**
   - Track reliability metric consumption by service
   - Calculate remaining error budgets and burn rates
   - Project future consumption based on historical patterns
   - Allocate budget consumption to incidents and causes
   - Generate reports on budget status and trends

4. **Remediation Automation**
   - Analyze historical incident resolution patterns
   - Identify recurring issues amenable to automation
   - Generate and validate remediation rule templates
   - Track effectiveness of automated recovery actions
   - Provide continuous improvement metrics for automation

5. **Incident Management Support**
   - Capture and sequence events during incidents
   - Reconstruct incident timelines for analysis
   - Measure key incident response metrics
   - Support postmortem analysis and learning
   - Generate insights for process improvement

6. **Alert Routing and Management**
