# SRE-Focused Log Analysis Framework

A specialized log analysis framework designed for Site Reliability Engineers to monitor service level objectives, track reliability metrics, and automate incident response.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive log analysis system tailored for Site Reliability Engineers. It provides SLO impact analysis, error budget tracking, automated remediation suggestion, incident timeline reconstruction, and on-call rotation integration to help maintain reliable services and quickly respond to incidents.

## Persona Description

Priya maintains service level objectives (SLOs) for a critical SaaS platform. She needs to correlate logs with system metrics to identify reliability issues before they impact customers and automate remediation responses.

## Key Requirements

1. **SLO Impact Analysis**
   - Implement functionality to automatically correlate log events with service level objective violations
   - Critical for Priya to understand which specific system events are threatening or violating SLOs
   - Must connect log events to specific SLIs (Service Level Indicators) to determine impact
   - Should identify patterns that predict potential SLO breaches before they occur
   - Must prioritize events by their impact on customer-facing reliability metrics

2. **Error Budget Tracking**
   - Create a system to track reliability metric consumption over time with forecasting
   - Essential for Priya to manage the balance between reliability and development velocity
   - Should calculate remaining error budget for different services and SLOs
   - Must provide burn rate analysis to predict when budgets will be exhausted
   - Should correlate budget consumption with releases, incidents, and infrastructure changes

3. **Automated Remediation Rule Creation**
   - Develop functionality to suggest remediation actions based on historical successful resolution patterns
   - Necessary for Priya to minimize time-to-resolution for common incidents
   - Should analyze past incident resolutions to identify effective patterns
   - Must generate actionable, safe remediation steps that can be automated
   - Should learn and improve suggestions based on feedback and outcomes

4. **Incident Response Timeline Reconstruction**
   - Build analysis tools for detailed postmortem investigation
   - Important for Priya to learn from incidents and improve future response
   - Should recreate the sequence of events during an incident across all systems
   - Must correlate actions taken by responders with system state changes
   - Should identify timing gaps and opportunities for faster response

5. **On-call Rotation Integration**
   - Implement routing of alerts to the appropriate team member with necessary context
   - Vital for Priya to ensure the right expertise is engaged for different types of incidents
   - Should direct alerts to on-call engineers based on service, component, and expertise
   - Must include relevant context and suggested actions with notifications
   - Should track response times and effectiveness to improve routing rules

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functionality must be testable via pytest with appropriate fixtures and mocks
- Tests must validate SLO calculation and error budget tracking accuracy
- Test coverage should exceed 85% for all modules
- Performance tests must verify analysis capabilities under high log volume conditions
- Tests should validate learning algorithms with historical incident data

### Performance Expectations
- Must process thousands of log entries per second for real-time SLO monitoring
- Should analyze millions of historical log entries for pattern recognition in under 10 minutes
- Alert routing and notification should occur within seconds of detecting SLO impacts
- Remediation suggestion generation should complete within 30 seconds of incident detection
- Must handle microservice architectures with hundreds of interconnected services

### Integration Points
- Compatible with monitoring systems (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
- Support for incident management platforms (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)
- Integration with configuration management and deployment systems
- Support for common SRE tools and frameworks
- Optional integration with ChatOps platforms for collaborative incident response

### Key Constraints
- Should operate with read-only access to production systems for analysis
- Must suggest remediation actions with clear risk assessments
- Implementation should be service architecture agnostic
- Should minimize alert noise and false positives
- Must respect rate limits on notification systems

## Core Functionality

The system must implement these core capabilities:

1. **SLO Monitoring Engine**
   - Define and track service level indicators
   - Calculate SLO compliance over configurable time windows
   - Correlate log events with SLI fluctuations
   - Predict potential SLO violations before they occur

2. **Error Budget Calculator**
   - Track consumed and remaining error budget
   - Calculate burn rates and project exhaustion dates
   - Allocate budget consumption to specific incidents
   - Provide historical budget consumption patterns

3. **Remediation Recommendation System**
   - Analyze historical incident resolutions
   - Identify effective resolution patterns
   - Generate prioritized remediation steps
   - Learn from resolution outcomes

4. **Incident Analysis Tool**
   - Reconstruct incident timelines from distributed logs
   - Correlate system state changes with responder actions
   - Identify root causes and contributing factors
   - Generate structured postmortem reports

5. **Alert Routing System**
   - Manage on-call schedules and rotations
   - Route alerts based on service and expertise
   - Provide context-rich notifications
   - Track response effectiveness

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify

- **SLO Analysis**: Verify correct correlation between log events and SLO violations
- **Budget Calculation**: Ensure accurate tracking of error budget consumption and burndown
- **Remediation Suggestions**: Validate relevant and safe automated remediation recommendations
- **Incident Timeline**: Confirm accurate reconstruction of incident chronology across services
- **Alert Routing**: Verify correct delivery of alerts to appropriate on-call personnel

### Critical User Scenarios

- Detecting an emerging slowdown before it violates SLOs
- Managing error budget during a partial outage
- Recommending remediation steps for a recurring infrastructure issue
- Reconstructing a complex incident timeline for postmortem analysis
- Routing midnight alerts to the correct on-call engineer with proper context

### Performance Benchmarks

- Process 10,000+ logs per second for real-time SLO monitoring
- Calculate error budget impact for an incident within 5 seconds
- Generate remediation suggestions for common incidents in under 30 seconds
- Reconstruct a 2-hour incident timeline spanning 50 services in under 2 minutes
- Route and deliver alerts with full context in under 10 seconds from detection

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

- Handle missing or delayed logs during service degradation
- Manage conflicting indicators across dependent services
- Process incomplete incident resolution data for remediation learning
- Handle on-call schedule exceptions and escalations
- Manage alert storms during cascading failures

### Test Coverage Requirements

- 90% coverage for SLO monitoring and correlation logic
- 90% coverage for error budget calculation
- 85% coverage for remediation suggestion algorithms
- 85% coverage for incident timeline reconstruction
- 90% coverage for alert routing logic
- 85% overall code coverage

## Success Criteria

The implementation meets Priya's needs when it can:

1. Detect and correlate log events with SLO impacts with >90% accuracy
2. Track error budget consumption with accurate forecasting of depletion dates
3. Suggest effective remediation actions for at least 70% of common incidents
4. Reconstruct accurate incident timelines including system and human actions
5. Route alerts to the appropriate on-call engineer with >95% accuracy
6. Reduce mean time to detection (MTTD) for SLO violations by at least 50%
7. Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for common incidents by at least 40%

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment and start working on this project:

1. Initialize a new Python library project using uv:
   ```
   uv init --lib
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest
   ```

4. Run specific tests:
   ```
   uv run pytest tests/test_slo_monitor.py
   ```

5. Run your code:
   ```
   uv run python examples/analyze_service_logs.py
   ```

Remember that all functionality should be implemented as importable Python modules with well-defined APIs, not as user-facing applications.
