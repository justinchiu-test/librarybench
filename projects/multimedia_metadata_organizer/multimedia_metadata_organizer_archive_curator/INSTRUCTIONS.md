# Historical Archive Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system tailored for curators of historical photograph collections. The system standardizes cataloging practices for inconsistent or missing metadata across century-spanning archives while enhancing existing metadata to make collections academically valuable and searchable using historically appropriate taxonomies.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen manages a university's historical photograph collection spanning over a century of images with inconsistent or missing metadata. He needs to establish standardized cataloging practices and enhance existing metadata to make the collection academically valuable.

## Key Requirements
1. **Period-appropriate taxonomies**: A system implementing historically accurate categorization schemes. This feature is critical because it ensures photographs are classified using terminology and hierarchies relevant to their time period, making the collection more valuable to historical researchers by presenting images in their proper historical context.

2. **Handwritten notation extraction**: Tools attempting to digitize notes from physical photographs. This feature is essential because many historical photographs contain valuable handwritten information on their reverse or margins that is currently inaccessible in digital form, and capturing this information can provide crucial provenance details and historical context.

3. **Historical geocoding**: Functionality for matching outdated place names with their modern equivalents. This capability is vital because geographical references in historical collections often use obsolete place names, boundary definitions, or colonial-era terminology that need mapping to contemporary locations to make them searchable and link them to modern geographical resources.

4. **Provenance tracking**: A method for documenting acquisition source and chain of ownership. This feature is crucial because establishing the authenticity and legitimate ownership of historical materials is fundamental to academic integrity and legal compliance, especially for sensitive historical materials with complex ownership histories.

5. **Academic citation generator**: Tools creating properly formatted references for scholarly use. This functionality is important because it facilitates the use of archival materials in academic research by providing standardized citations that conform to various academic style guides, encouraging proper attribution and broader scholarly use of the collection.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All taxonomy mapping functions must be independently testable
  - Historical geocoding algorithms must be verifiable with known historical-to-modern location mappings
  - Provenance tracking must maintain audit trails that can be validated
  - Citation generation must be verifiable against academic style guides
  - Text extraction from image-based handwritten notes must be evaluated against ground truth datasets

- **Performance expectations**:
  - Process at least 100 items per minute for basic metadata standardization
  - Handle collections of up to 1 million historical photographs
  - Support incremental processing of large archives
  - Optimize storage for historical metadata that may be extensive

- **Integration points**:
  - Standard archival metadata formats (Dublin Core, MODS, EAD)
  - Academic citation systems (Chicago, MLA, APA)
  - Historical geospatial databases
  - OCR and handwriting recognition systems
  - Institutional repository systems

- **Key constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no external UI components
  - Must preserve original metadata even when enhanced or standardized
  - Must support gradual enrichment of incomplete records
  - Must handle multilingual historical metadata appropriately

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide comprehensive APIs for managing historical photograph collections:

1. **Historical Taxonomy Manager**: Define, import, and apply period-appropriate categorization schemes. Map between different historical taxonomies and modern classification systems. Support hierarchical relationships between terms and concepts that were relevant in different time periods.

2. **Notation Digitization System**: Extract and process text from images of handwritten notes. Link transcribed notations to their source photographs and provide confidence scoring for extracted text. Support manual verification workflows for uncertain extractions.

3. **Historical Geocoding Engine**: Convert historical place names to modern equivalents. Handle changing political boundaries, renamed locations, and colonial-era geographical terms. Visualize historical locations on modern maps through standardized coordinates.

4. **Provenance Documentation System**: Track and verify the complete chain of custody for archival materials. Document acquisition methods, previous owners, institutional transfers, and authentication evidence. Generate provenance reports for academic or legal purposes.

5. **Academic Reference Generator**: Create properly formatted citations according to major academic style guides. Generate stable identifiers for archival resources. Support export of citation data to reference management systems used in academic research.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate application of period-appropriate taxonomies
  - Text extraction quality from handwritten notations
  - Correct mapping of historical place names to modern locations
  - Complete and accurate provenance chain documentation
  - Generation of properly formatted academic citations

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Processing a newly acquired collection of historical photographs
  - Enhancing metadata for a partially documented collection
  - Generating a research-ready dataset for academic use
  - Tracing the provenance of items with complex ownership history
  - Converting between different historical and modern classification systems

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Process 10,000 photograph records with basic standardization in under 2 hours
  - Historical geocoding lookups completed in under 5 seconds per item
  - Citation generation for batches of 1,000 items in under 3 minutes
  - System must handle incremental processing with minimal performance degradation

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Completely missing or severely degraded metadata
  - Conflicting historical information from different sources
  - Untranslatable historical terms or concepts
  - Boundary cases in historical geocoding (disputed territories, renamed multiple times)
  - Partial or illegible handwritten notations
  - Broken provenance chains with missing information

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for taxonomy management and mapping
  - 90% coverage for historical geocoding functions
  - 95% coverage for provenance tracking and verification
  - 90% coverage for citation generation
  - 85% coverage for handwritten notation extraction

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. Demonstrates accurate application of period-appropriate taxonomies across test collections
2. Successfully extracts legible handwritten notations with at least 80% accuracy
3. Correctly maps historical place names to modern equivalents with 90% accuracy
4. Maintains complete provenance records that satisfy academic authentication standards
5. Generates citations that conform to major academic style guides with 100% accuracy
6. Passes all test cases with the required coverage metrics
7. Processes collections efficiently within the performance benchmarks
8. Provides a well-documented API suitable for integration with institutional systems
