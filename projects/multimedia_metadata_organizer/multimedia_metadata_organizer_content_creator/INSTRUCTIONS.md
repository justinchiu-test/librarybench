# Content Creator Metadata Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive metadata management system for social media content creators that tracks platform usage, engagement metrics, hashtag strategies, content scheduling, and performance trends. The system enables efficient content repurposing while preventing duplication and optimizing engagement strategies across multiple platforms.

## Persona Description
Jamal produces content across multiple platforms and needs to track which photos and videos have been used, where they've been published, and how they've performed. He wants to repurpose content efficiently while avoiding duplication.

## Key Requirements

1. **Platform Usage Tracking**
   - Monitors where and when each media asset has been published across different social platforms
   - Critical for Jamal because it prevents accidental reuse on the same platform while identifying opportunities to repurpose content across different channels
   - Must maintain a comprehensive publication history with detailed platform-specific context including post URLs, publication dates, and account information

2. **Engagement Metrics Association**
   - Links performance data from various platforms to specific media assets
   - Essential for Jamal's content strategy as it connects content characteristics with audience response, enabling data-driven decisions about what performs well
   - Must aggregate metrics like views, likes, comments, shares, and click-through rates from different platforms into normalized, comparable datasets

3. **Hashtag and Keyword Management**
   - Implements consistent tagging strategies across platforms while optimizing for each channel
   - Vital for Jamal's discoverability as it ensures his content uses the most effective keywords for each platform's algorithm
   - Must track hashtag performance, recommend optimal tags based on trends, and maintain a taxonomy of personal tagging conventions

4. **Content Calendar Integration**
   - Schedules media for future publishing dates and tracks publication timelines
   - Crucial for Jamal's workflow planning as it provides visibility into scheduled content across platforms and prevents timing conflicts
   - Must support complex publishing schedules, recurring content themes, and platform-specific timing optimization

5. **Trend Analysis**
   - Identifies visual elements, topics, or formats that drive higher engagement
   - Indispensable for Jamal's content optimization as it reveals patterns in successful content, allowing him to replicate high-performing characteristics
   - Must analyze correlations between content attributes (visual elements, topics, formats) and engagement metrics to identify success factors

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - Platform tracking functions must be independently testable with simulated publication data
  - Metrics association must verify correct relationship mapping
  - Hashtag management must be testable against reference performance data
  - Calendar functions must verify scheduling conflicts and optimization
  - Trend analysis algorithms must produce consistent results for test datasets

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle content libraries with 10,000+ media items
  - Trend analysis should complete in under 30 seconds for the entire library
  - Search and filtering operations should return results in under 1 second
  - Must support concurrent updates from multiple platform data sources

- **Integration Points**
  - Social media platform APIs for performance data
  - Calendar systems for scheduling coordination
  - Hashtag and trend monitoring services
  - Content management and scheduling tools

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must maintain privacy and security for unpublished content
  - Must handle rate limits and API restrictions from different platforms
  - Must adapt to changing metrics and algorithms across platforms
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for social media content with these core capabilities:

1. **Publication Tracking and History**
   - Record complete publication history for each media asset
   - Track cross-platform usage of the same content
   - Prevent accidental duplication while enabling intentional repurposing

2. **Performance Metrics Management**
   - Collect and normalize engagement data across platforms
   - Associate metrics with specific content and attributes
   - Enable comparative analysis across different channels

3. **Content Optimization**
   - Manage hashtags and keywords for different platforms
   - Track tagging effectiveness and trending topics
   - Recommend optimal tagging strategies based on performance

4. **Publication Planning**
   - Schedule content across multiple platforms
   - Prevent conflicts and optimize timing
   - Coordinate themed content and campaign releases

5. **Performance Analysis**
   - Identify patterns in successful content
   - Correlate content characteristics with engagement metrics
   - Generate actionable insights for content strategy

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate tracking of publication history across platforms
  - Correct association of engagement metrics with media assets
  - Effective management of hashtags and keywords
  - Proper handling of content scheduling and conflicts
  - Accurate identification of performance trends and patterns

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Adding new content to the library and planning its publication
  - Analyzing the performance of published content across platforms
  - Identifying opportunities to repurpose high-performing content
  - Optimizing hashtag strategies based on performance data
  - Scheduling a coordinated multi-platform content campaign

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Publication tracking must handle at least 50 updates per second
  - Trend analysis must process the entire library in under 30 seconds
  - Hashtag effectiveness calculations must complete in under 5 seconds
  - System must maintain responsive performance with 10,000+ media items

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Platform API failures or rate limiting
  - Conflicting engagement metrics from different sources
  - Removed or edited posts requiring history reconciliation
  - Rapid trend changes affecting hashtag effectiveness
  - Content published outside the system requiring retrospective tracking

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for core tracking functions
  - 100% coverage for engagement metric normalization
  - Comprehensive coverage of scheduling conflict detection
  - Complete verification of trend correlation algorithms
