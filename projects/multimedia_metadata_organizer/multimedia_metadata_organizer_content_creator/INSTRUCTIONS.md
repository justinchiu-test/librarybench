# Social Media Content Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for social media content creators who need to track media usage across multiple platforms, analyze performance, and efficiently repurpose content while avoiding duplication.

## Persona Description
Jamal produces content across multiple platforms and needs to track which photos and videos have been used, where they've been published, and how they've performed. He wants to repurpose content efficiently while avoiding duplication.

## Key Requirements
1. **Platform usage tracking**: Develop a system to record where and when each media asset has been published across different social platforms. This is critical for preventing redundant posting and understanding the distribution history of content across the creator's social media ecosystem.

2. **Engagement metrics association**: Create functionality to connect performance data (likes, shares, comments, etc.) with specific media assets. This enables data-driven content strategy by identifying which visual elements and content types generate the most engagement.

3. **Hashtag and keyword management**: Implement tools for maintaining consistent cross-platform tagging strategies and analyzing tag performance. This ensures content discoverability and brand consistency while optimizing for each platform's unique audience and algorithm.

4. **Content calendar integration**: Build mechanisms to schedule media for future publishing dates and organize content planning. This provides structure to the content creation workflow and enables strategic timing of posts across platforms.

5. **Trend analysis**: Develop analytics to identify visual or thematic elements that drive higher engagement. This helps the creator understand which content characteristics resonate with audiences and informs future content creation decisions.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All platform tracking and metrics functions must be independently testable
- Use test fixtures with sample social media metrics and publishing history
- Support simulation of various engagement patterns
- Enable isolated testing of scheduling and calendar functions

### Performance Expectations
- Process metadata for at least 5,000 content pieces efficiently
- Support content libraries with up to 50,000 assets
- Analysis operations should complete in under 5 seconds
- Schedule management should handle complex publishing calendars

### Integration Points
- Common image and video formats used in social media
- Platform-specific metadata requirements and limitations
- Analytics and engagement metrics from various platforms
- Hashtag and keyword databases for performance tracking
- Content calendar and scheduling systems

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - all functionality exposed through Python APIs
- System must adapt to changing platform requirements
- Data structures must accommodate cross-platform metrics normalization
- Analytics should work with incomplete or inconsistent engagement data

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library that enables:

1. **Content Usage Tracking**
   - Track which assets have been published on which platforms
   - Record publishing dates, contexts, and formats
   - Identify unused or underutilized content

2. **Cross-Platform Analytics**
   - Normalize engagement metrics across different platforms
   - Associate performance data with specific content assets
   - Generate comparative performance analysis

3. **Metadata Optimization**
   - Manage hashtags and keywords across platforms
   - Track tag performance and trends
   - Suggest optimal tagging strategies based on performance

4. **Content Planning and Scheduling**
   - Organize content for future publishing
   - Maintain publishing schedules across platforms
   - Prevent duplicate or redundant posting

5. **Performance Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify visual and thematic elements driving engagement
   - Analyze temporal patterns in content performance
   - Generate insights for content strategy optimization

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests that verify:

1. **Platform Tracking**
   - Test recording of publishing history across platforms
   - Verify detection of duplicate or redundant content usage
   - Test platform-specific metadata handling

2. **Metrics Integration**
   - Test association of engagement metrics with content
   - Verify normalization of metrics across platforms
   - Test handling of incomplete or missing metrics

3. **Tag Management**
   - Test hashtag and keyword organization
   - Verify cross-platform tagging consistency
   - Test performance tracking of different tags

4. **Scheduling Functionality**
   - Test content calendar management
   - Verify scheduling across multiple platforms
   - Test conflict detection and resolution

5. **Analytics Capabilities**
   - Test identification of high-performing content elements
   - Verify trend detection in engagement patterns
   - Test generation of actionable content insights

**IMPORTANT:**
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Setup Instructions
1. Set up a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project: `uv pip install -e .`

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented
2. The system accurately tracks content usage across multiple platforms
3. Engagement metrics are properly associated with specific content assets
4. Hashtag and keyword management provides consistent cross-platform tagging
5. Content calendar integration successfully organizes future publishing schedules
6. Trend analysis effectively identifies patterns in content performance
7. All tests pass when run with pytest
8. A valid pytest_results.json file is generated showing all tests passing

**REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.**
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
