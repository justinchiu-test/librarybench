# Social Media Content Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for content creators who publish across multiple platforms, tracking where content has been used, how it has performed, and identifying trends to optimize future content while avoiding duplication.

## Persona Description
Jamal produces content across multiple platforms and needs to track which photos and videos have been used, where they've been published, and how they've performed. He wants to repurpose content efficiently while avoiding duplication.

## Key Requirements
1. **Platform usage tracking**: A system showing where and when each asset has been published. This feature is critical because content creators manage thousands of media assets across multiple platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, etc.), and without systematic tracking, they risk reposting the same content to the same audience or losing track of their publishing history.

2. **Engagement metrics association**: Tools connecting content performance data with specific media. This feature is essential because understanding which content performs well on different platforms is fundamental to content strategy, and systematically linking engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments, click-through rates) to specific assets reveals patterns that inform future content creation.

3. **Hashtag and keyword management**: Functionality for consistent cross-platform tagging strategies. This capability is vital because effective discovery depends on strategic use of tags and keywords, and a system that manages these taxonomies across platforms ensures consistent branding, maximizes content discoverability, and allows analysis of which tags drive the most engagement.

4. **Content calendar integration**: A mechanism for scheduling media for future publishing dates. This feature is crucial because planned, consistent posting is key to building audience engagement, and a system that organizes content by publication schedule helps maintain a steady content flow while preventing gaps or oversaturation.

5. **Trend analysis**: Tools identifying visual or thematic elements that drive higher engagement. This functionality is important because data-driven content creation significantly outperforms random approaches, and analyzing which visual styles, topics, or formats generate the most engagement helps optimize future content strategy and resource allocation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All platform tracking functions must be independently testable
  - Metrics association must be verifiable with sample engagement data
  - Hashtag management must be tested for cross-platform consistency
  - Calendar scheduling must handle complex publishing patterns
  - Trend analysis algorithms must identify patterns in test datasets

- **Performance expectations**:
  - Handle collections of up to 50,000 media assets
  - Process engagement metrics from up to 10 different platforms
  - Support complex searches across multiple metadata dimensions
  - Generate reports and analyses within seconds
  - Optimize for frequent updates and real-time metric tracking

- **Integration points**:
  - Social media platform APIs for publishing history
  - Analytics systems for engagement metrics
  - Calendar systems for scheduling
  - Common image and video formats
  - Export formats for various publishing platforms

- **Key constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no external UI components
  - Must handle the diverse metadata requirements of different platforms
  - Must support frequent updates as new content is created
  - Should optimize for quick searches and filtering
  - Must scale efficiently as content library grows

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide comprehensive APIs for managing social media content:

1. **Cross-Platform Publishing Tracker**: Record and manage content publishing history across multiple platforms. Track republishing and content repurposing. Maintain platform-specific identifiers and links. Prevent accidental duplication of content.

2. **Engagement Analytics Engine**: Import and normalize engagement metrics from various platforms. Associate performance data with specific content assets. Calculate comparative performance statistics. Generate performance insights based on historical data.

3. **Tag and Keyword Manager**: Define and maintain consistent tagging strategies. Recommend optimal tags based on platform and content type. Track tag performance. Generate platform-specific tag sets that maintain brand consistency.

4. **Content Scheduling System**: Organize content by planned publication dates. Manage publishing frequency across platforms. Track content themes and campaigns over time. Identify gaps or conflicts in publishing schedules.

5. **Content Pattern Analyzer**: Identify visual, thematic, and structural elements that correlate with higher engagement. Recognize temporal patterns in audience response. Generate actionable insights for future content creation. Track evolving audience preferences.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate tracking of content publishing across platforms
  - Correct association of engagement metrics with content
  - Consistent management of tags and keywords
  - Proper scheduling of content for future publication
  - Reliable identification of engagement patterns and trends

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Tracking a content asset across its complete lifecycle
  - Analyzing performance metrics for a content campaign
  - Developing a cross-platform tagging strategy
  - Planning a content calendar for multiple platforms
  - Identifying the best-performing content elements for future strategy

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Import publishing history for 10,000 items in under 5 minutes
  - Process engagement metrics from 5 platforms in under 3 minutes
  - Generate tag recommendations in under 5 seconds
  - Create content calendar with 1,000 scheduled items in under 20 seconds
  - Perform trend analysis on 10,000 content items in under 3 minutes

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Content published without proper tracking
  - Inconsistent or missing engagement metrics
  - Platform API changes or failures
  - Conflicting scheduling requests
  - Content repurposed in significantly modified forms
  - Rapid fluctuations in engagement patterns
  - Cross-platform inconsistencies in metadata

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for platform tracking functions
  - 90% coverage for metrics association
  - 95% coverage for hashtag and keyword management
  - 90% coverage for calendar integration
  - 85% coverage for trend analysis algorithms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. Demonstrates comprehensive tracking of content across multiple platforms without gaps
2. Successfully associates engagement metrics with specific content with accurate attribution
3. Effectively manages consistent tagging and keyword strategies across platforms
4. Accurately schedules and tracks content for future publication
5. Reliably identifies patterns and trends in content performance
6. Passes all test cases with the required coverage metrics
7. Processes content collections efficiently within the performance benchmarks
8. Provides a well-documented API suitable for integration with content creation workflows
