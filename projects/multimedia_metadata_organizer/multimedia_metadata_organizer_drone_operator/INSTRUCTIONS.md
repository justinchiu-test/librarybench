# Drone Survey Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata management system for drone operators that organizes aerial imagery with precise spatial and technical metadata. The system enables flight mission organization, temporal sequence analysis, sensor calibration tracking, client deliverable packaging, and coordinate system transformation to support professional aerial survey operations.

## Persona Description
Kwame captures aerial imagery for land surveys, construction monitoring, and agricultural assessment. He needs to organize thousands of geotagged images and maintain their precise spatial metadata for technical analysis.

## Key Requirements

1. **Flight Mission Organization**
   - Groups images by specific survey operations and flight parameters
   - Critical for Kwame because it establishes the operational context for each image and enables efficient management of large volumes of imagery from different projects
   - Must track comprehensive flight metadata including mission objectives, flight paths, altitude profiles, weather conditions, and UAV specifications

2. **Temporal Sequence Visualization**
   - Enables analysis of changes to the same location captured over multiple surveys
   - Essential for Kwame's monitoring projects as it reveals temporal patterns and changes in sites over time
   - Must accurately align images from different dates based on spatial coordinates and create ordered sequences that highlight progressive changes

3. **Sensor Calibration Metadata Tracking**
   - Maintains detailed records of sensor specifications and calibration status
   - Vital for Kwame's data quality as it ensures measurement accuracy and enables appropriate corrections based on known sensor characteristics
   - Must track camera/sensor models, calibration dates, distortion parameters, spectral sensitivities, and changes in calibration over time

4. **Client Deliverable Packaging**
   - Prepares survey data in formats specific to different industries and applications
   - Crucial for Kwame's client service as it creates properly formatted deliverables that meet the technical requirements of different sectors
   - Must support various output formats including GIS-ready data, construction monitoring reports, agricultural analysis packages, and raw data exports with appropriate metadata

5. **Coordinate System Transformation**
   - Converts between different geographic reference standards and projections
   - Indispensable for Kwame's technical accuracy as it ensures compatibility with client systems and local survey standards
   - Must support multiple coordinate reference systems, datum transformations, and industry-specific projection standards

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - Flight grouping functions must be testable with sample mission datasets
  - Temporal sequence alignment must be verifiable with known coordinate sets
  - Calibration tracking must maintain verifiable parameter history
  - Output format generation must validate against industry specifications
  - Coordinate transformations must be testable against known reference points

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle projects with 10,000+ high-resolution images
  - Spatial operations should process at least 100 images per second
  - Coordinate transformations should complete in under 50ms per point
  - Must support batch processing of entire missions without memory exhaustion

- **Integration Points**
  - Drone flight logging systems and telemetry data
  - GIS and spatial data infrastructure
  - Photogrammetry and image processing pipelines
  - Industry-specific data formats and standards
  - Sensor and camera calibration systems

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must preserve original geospatial metadata without modification
  - Must maintain sub-meter accuracy for spatial references
  - Must handle very large image files (100MB+) efficiently
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for drone survey operations with these core capabilities:

1. **Flight and Mission Management**
   - Organize imagery by missions, flights, and operational parameters
   - Track comprehensive flight metadata and conditions
   - Group related imagery for efficient project management

2. **Geospatial Data Processing**
   - Maintain precise location information for all imagery
   - Transform between different coordinate systems and projections
   - Support spatial queries and location-based organization

3. **Temporal Analysis Support**
   - Align images of the same location across different time periods
   - Track changes in features over multiple surveys
   - Create ordered sequences showing site evolution

4. **Technical Metadata Management**
   - Track sensor specifications and calibration parameters
   - Document data quality and accuracy metrics
   - Maintain complete technical provenance for all imagery

5. **Deliverable Generation**
   - Create client-specific data packages and formats
   - Apply appropriate transformations for different industries
   - Maintain metadata integrity in exported products

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Correct organization of images by flight mission parameters
  - Accurate alignment of temporal sequences based on spatial coordinates
  - Proper tracking of sensor calibration metadata and history
  - Successful generation of industry-specific deliverable formats
  - Precise transformation between different coordinate systems

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Processing a complete drone survey mission into the system
  - Creating a temporal sequence showing site changes over multiple surveys
  - Tracking and applying sensor calibration parameters to ensure data accuracy
  - Generating client deliverables for specific industry requirements
  - Converting survey data between different coordinate reference systems

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Flight organization must process complete missions (1,000+ images) in under 30 seconds
  - Temporal sequence alignment must handle at least 100 images per second
  - Coordinate transformations must maintain sub-meter accuracy
  - System must scale efficiently to projects with 10,000+ high-resolution images

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Images with missing or corrupted GPS metadata
  - Surveys conducted with multiple drone/sensor combinations
  - Extreme terrain with significant elevation changes
  - Temporal sequences with variable image resolution or coverage
  - Projects requiring unusual coordinate systems or projections

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 95% code coverage for geospatial functions
  - 100% coverage for coordinate transformation algorithms
