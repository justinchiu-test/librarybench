# Drone Survey Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for drone operators who capture aerial imagery for land surveys, construction monitoring, and agricultural assessment, with a focus on maintaining precise spatial metadata for technical analysis.

## Persona Description
Kwame captures aerial imagery for land surveys, construction monitoring, and agricultural assessment. He needs to organize thousands of geotagged images and maintain their precise spatial metadata for technical analysis.

## Key Requirements
1. **Flight mission organization**: Create a system to group images by specific survey operations and flight parameters. This is essential for maintaining proper context for each capture and ensuring images are associated with the correct mission parameters and client projects.

2. **Temporal sequence visualization**: Develop functionality to show changes to the same location over multiple surveys and time periods. This is critical for monitoring projects over time and identifying changes in terrain, construction progress, or crop health.

3. **Sensor calibration metadata tracking**: Build mechanisms to ensure measurement accuracy across different equipment and environmental conditions. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and enabling precise measurements from aerial imagery.

4. **Client deliverable packaging**: Implement tools for preparing data in formats specific to different industries and client requirements. This streamlines the delivery process and ensures clients receive properly formatted data that integrates with their systems.

5. **Coordinate system transformation**: Create functionality supporting multiple geographic reference standards and conversions between them. This is essential for working with clients across different industries who may use different coordinate systems and projections.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All spatial processing and coordinate transformation functions must be independently testable
- Use test fixtures with sample drone imagery metadata and flight logs
- Support simulation of temporal sequences and mission patterns
- Enable isolated testing of sensor calibration calculations

### Performance Expectations
- Process metadata for at least 5,000 high-resolution aerial images efficiently
- Handle projects with up to 100,000 images across multiple missions
- Support batch processing of large image sets for client deliverables
- Spatial queries should complete in under 3 seconds

### Integration Points
- Common aerial imagery formats and their metadata
- GPS and EXIF geolocation standards
- Drone flight log formats from major manufacturers
- GIS and mapping coordinate systems and projections
- Industry-specific data formats for various client sectors

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - all functionality exposed through Python APIs
- System must maintain geospatial precision throughout all operations
- Operations must preserve original metadata while enhancing with derived data
- Storage requirements must be optimized for large high-resolution image collections

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library that enables:

1. **Mission and Flight Management**
   - Organize imagery by flight mission and operation
   - Associate flight logs with captured imagery
   - Track drone settings and environmental conditions

2. **Spatial and Temporal Organization**
   - Organize captures by precise geographic location
   - Track temporal sequences of the same location
   - Support time-series analysis of geographic areas

3. **Calibration and Accuracy Control**
   - Track sensor calibration data for each mission
   - Account for environmental factors affecting measurements
   - Validate measurement accuracy across equipment changes

4. **Client Delivery Preparation**
   - Format data according to client-specific requirements
   - Support industry-standard export formats
   - Generate appropriate metadata for client systems

5. **Coordinate and Projection Handling**
   - Transform between different coordinate systems
   - Support multiple map projections
   - Maintain spatial accuracy during transformations

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests that verify:

1. **Mission Organization**
   - Test grouping of images by flight mission
   - Verify association of flight parameters with imagery
   - Test organization across multiple projects and clients

2. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Test sequence organization of the same location over time
   - Verify detection of changes between captures
   - Test handling of irregular capture intervals

3. **Calibration Management**
   - Test tracking of sensor calibration data
   - Verify adjustment for environmental factors
   - Test validation of measurement accuracy

4. **Deliverable Preparation**
   - Test generation of client-specific formats
   - Verify proper metadata inclusion in deliverables
   - Test batch processing for large deliveries

5. **Coordinate Handling**
   - Test transformation between coordinate systems
   - Verify maintenance of spatial accuracy
   - Test handling of edge cases in projections

**IMPORTANT:**
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Setup Instructions
1. Set up a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project: `uv pip install -e .`

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented
2. Flight mission organization correctly groups images by survey operations
3. Temporal sequence visualization effectively shows changes over time
4. Sensor calibration metadata tracking ensures measurement accuracy
5. Client deliverable packaging correctly formats data for different industries
6. Coordinate system transformation supports multiple geographic reference standards
7. All operations maintain geospatial precision and accuracy
8. All tests pass when run with pytest
9. A valid pytest_results.json file is generated showing all tests passing

**REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.**
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
