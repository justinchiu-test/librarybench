# Drone Survey Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for drone operators who capture aerial imagery for technical applications, organizing geotagged images by mission parameters, visualizing temporal sequences, tracking sensor calibration data, and preparing deliverables in industry-specific formats.

## Persona Description
Kwame captures aerial imagery for land surveys, construction monitoring, and agricultural assessment. He needs to organize thousands of geotagged images and maintain their precise spatial metadata for technical analysis.

## Key Requirements
1. **Flight mission organization**: A system grouping images by specific survey operations and parameters. This feature is critical because drone operators conduct multiple missions with distinct objectives and flight parameters, and organizing imagery by mission context (flight altitude, sensor settings, weather conditions, client requirements) ensures data integrity and enables accurate analysis based on capture conditions.

2. **Temporal sequence visualization**: Tools showing changes to the same location over multiple surveys. This feature is essential because many drone applications involve monitoring changes over time (construction progress, crop growth, erosion), and the ability to precisely align and compare images of the same location across different time points reveals critical temporal patterns and progressions.

3. **Sensor calibration metadata tracking**: Functionality ensuring measurement accuracy across equipment. This capability is vital because precise measurements and analysis depend on accurate sensor calibration, and tracking calibration parameters for each sensor (cameras, multispectral, thermal, LiDAR) across multiple flights ensures data reliability and enables proper correction of any sensor-specific distortions.

4. **Client deliverable packaging**: A mechanism for preparing data in formats specific to different industries. This feature is crucial because drone data serves diverse technical applications (GIS systems, CAD software, agricultural analysis tools, BIM platforms), and automated preparation of deliverables in client-specific formats with appropriate metadata ensures compatibility with specialized analysis software.

5. **Coordinate system transformation**: Tools supporting multiple geographic reference standards. This functionality is important because different clients and applications require different coordinate systems (UTM, State Plane, local grids), and the ability to accurately transform spatial references while preserving measurement accuracy ensures compatibility with client-specific systems and integration with existing geospatial data.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All mission organization functions must be independently testable
  - Temporal sequence alignment must be verifiable with known reference points
  - Calibration tracking must maintain accurate parameter records
  - Deliverable packaging must validate output against industry standards
  - Coordinate transformations must be tested for mathematical accuracy

- **Performance expectations**:
  - Process collections with up to 100,000 high-resolution images
  - Handle large geospatial datasets efficiently (orthomosiacs, point clouds)
  - Support batch processing for deliverable generation
  - Enable rapid search and filtering by spatial and temporal parameters
  - Optimize storage and retrieval of multi-terabyte datasets

- **Integration points**:
  - Standard geospatial formats (GeoTIFF, LAS/LAZ, KML)
  - Drone flight logs and telemetry data
  - Sensor calibration systems
  - Industry-specific analysis software
  - Coordinate reference system libraries

- **Key constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no external UI components
  - Must preserve original raw data alongside processed deliverables
  - Must handle extremely precise geospatial and temporal metadata
  - Must support various sensor types (RGB, multispectral, thermal, LiDAR)
  - Should be optimized for periodic batch processing of large datasets

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide comprehensive APIs for managing drone survey data:

1. **Mission Data Manager**: Define and document flight mission parameters. Organize imagery by flight sessions and objectives. Track environmental conditions and flight specifications. Link raw data to mission contexts.

2. **Temporal Analysis Framework**: Align images of the same location across different time points. Calculate and visualize change metrics. Generate time-series datasets for specific features. Support temporal filtering and comparison.

3. **Calibration Registry System**: Record and validate sensor calibration parameters. Track calibration history for each sensor. Apply appropriate corrections based on calibration data. Flag data collected with out-of-tolerance sensors.

4. **Deliverable Generation Engine**: Create industry-specific data products. Apply appropriate processing workflows for different applications. Package data with required metadata and documentation. Validate deliverables against client specifications.

5. **Coordinate Reference Manager**: Transform data between different coordinate systems. Maintain accuracy during spatial reference conversion. Document projection parameters and transformations. Validate spatial alignment across datasets.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate organization of imagery by mission parameters
  - Precise alignment of temporal sequences of the same location
  - Reliable tracking of sensor calibration metadata
  - Correct generation of client-specific deliverables
  - Accurate transformation between coordinate systems

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Processing a complete drone survey mission from raw data to deliverables
  - Comparing multiple temporal surveys of the same site
  - Tracking sensor calibration across multiple equipment configurations
  - Generating deliverables for different industry applications
  - Converting datasets between coordinate reference systems

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Process 5,000 high-resolution drone images with metadata in under 30 minutes
  - Align temporal sequences with 100 time points in under 5 minutes
  - Validate calibration parameters for a complete sensor suite in under 1 minute
  - Generate deliverables for a 10GB dataset in under 20 minutes
  - Transform coordinates for 10,000 data points in under 30 seconds

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Incomplete flight logs or mission data
  - Significant terrain or feature changes in temporal sequences
  - Missing or invalid calibration parameters
  - Incompatible data formats for specific deliverable types
  - Complex coordinate transformations across datums
  - Mixed sensor data within single missions
  - Extreme precision requirements for engineering applications

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for mission organization functions
  - 90% coverage for temporal sequence alignment
  - 95% coverage for calibration metadata tracking
  - 90% coverage for deliverable packaging
  - 95% coverage for coordinate transformation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
