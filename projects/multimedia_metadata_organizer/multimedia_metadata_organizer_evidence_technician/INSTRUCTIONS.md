# Forensic Multimedia Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata management system for law enforcement that maintains strict chain of custody for digital media evidence. The system provides tamper-evident verification, detailed access logging, case organization, PII detection, and court exhibit preparation to ensure digital evidence integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.

## Persona Description
Officer Rodriguez processes digital media evidence for law enforcement cases. He needs to maintain strict chain of custody while organizing case-related media in a way that's presentable in court proceedings.

## Key Requirements

1. **Tamper-Evident Metadata Verification**
   - Validates that files and their metadata have not been modified since acquisition
   - Critical for Officer Rodriguez because evidence integrity is fundamental to admissibility in court, and any modifications could render evidence unusable
   - Must calculate and verify cryptographic hashes of both file content and metadata to detect even minor alterations

2. **Chain of Custody Logging**
   - Records every access, view, and modification with complete user credentials and timestamps
   - Essential for Officer Rodriguez's legal requirements as it documents exactly who handled evidence, when, and what actions they performed
   - Must create immutable, cryptographically signed audit trails that meet legal standards for evidence handling

3. **Case Hierarchy Organization**
   - Structures evidence within a framework of cases, charges, and applicable legal statutes
   - Crucial for Officer Rodriguez's workflow as it connects evidence to specific legal contexts and facilitates discovery processes
   - Must support complex legal case structures with multiple defendants, charges, and related cases

4. **Automatic PII Detection**
   - Identifies personally identifiable information in media content for potential redaction
   - Vital for Officer Rodriguez's compliance with privacy laws and victim protection requirements
   - Must detect faces, license plates, addresses, identification documents, and other sensitive information that may require protection

5. **Court Exhibit Preparation**
   - Generates properly redacted and formatted files suitable for legal proceedings
   - Indispensable for Officer Rodriguez's role in supporting prosecutors by creating admissible, properly sanitized evidence presentations
   - Must maintain verifiable connections between original evidence and court-ready exhibits with complete documentation of any applied redactions

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - Cryptographic verification functions must be independently testable
  - Chain of custody mechanisms must create verifiable, immutable audit trails
  - Case organization structures must maintain referential integrity
  - PII detection algorithms must be testable with sample media files
  - Exhibit preparation must preserve evidence integrity while applying redactions

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle cases with 10,000+ media items
  - Hash verification should process at least 5 files per second
  - Search operations across case hierarchies should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Must maintain responsive performance even with comprehensive audit logging

- **Integration Points**
  - Standard forensic metadata formats and hash algorithms
  - Law enforcement case management systems
  - Legal statutes and charge classification systems
  - Digital signature and certificate systems for verification

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must never modify original evidence files under any circumstances
  - Must maintain complete isolation between cases to prevent cross-contamination
  - Must implement robust access controls with multi-factor authentication
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for digital evidence with these core capabilities:

1. **Evidence Integrity Management**
   - Calculate and verify cryptographic hashes for all files and metadata
   - Detect any alterations to files or metadata since acquisition
   - Maintain original evidence in unmodified state

2. **Chain of Custody Documentation**
   - Record complete details of every system interaction
   - Document all user access with authentication details
   - Create immutable audit trails for evidence handling

3. **Case Organization and Relationship Mapping**
   - Structure evidence within legal case hierarchies
   - Link evidence to specific charges and statutes
   - Track relationships between related cases and evidence

4. **Privacy and Sensitive Content Management**
   - Detect personally identifiable information in media content
   - Flag sensitive content requiring special handling
   - Support appropriate redaction while maintaining evidence value

5. **Legal Presentation Preparation**
   - Generate court-ready exhibits from original evidence
   - Apply necessary redactions while documenting all changes
   - Prepare evidence packages for legal proceedings

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate detection of any modifications to evidence or metadata
  - Complete and immutable chain of custody documentation
  - Proper organization of evidence within case hierarchies
  - Successful identification of PII and sensitive content
  - Correct preparation of court exhibits with appropriate redactions

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Processing newly acquired digital evidence into the system
  - Verifying the integrity of previously stored evidence
  - Tracking all access to sensitive case materials
  - Preparing evidence packages for court proceedings
  - Searching for specific evidence across multiple related cases

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Hash verification must process files at a minimum rate of 5 per second
  - Chain of custody logging must not impact system performance
  - Case hierarchy queries must resolve in under 2 seconds
  - System must scale to handle cases with 10,000+ media items

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Evidence files with corrupted or missing metadata
  - Attempted unauthorized access to case materials
  - Complex case structures with multiple defendants and charges
  - Media containing mixed sensitive and non-sensitive content
  - Evidence requiring special handling (e.g., contraband images)

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - 100% code coverage for integrity verification functions
  - 100% coverage for chain of custody mechanisms
  - Minimum 95% coverage for PII detection algorithms
  - Comprehensive coverage of exhibit preparation processes
  - Complete verification of access control mechanisms

## Success Criteria

1. The system detects 100% of modifications to evidence files or metadata.
2. Chain of custody records are complete, immutable, and meet legal standards.
3. Evidence is properly organized within case hierarchies with correct legal references.
4. PII detection identifies at least 95% of personally identifiable information.
5. Court exhibits maintain evidential integrity while applying appropriate redactions.
6. The system prevents unauthorized access and maintains complete audit trails.
7. Performance benchmarks are met for cases with 10,000+ media items.
8. The system handles complex case structures and sensitive content appropriately.
9. All operations maintain isolation between unrelated cases and evidence.
10. All functionality is accessible through well-documented Python APIs without requiring a UI.
