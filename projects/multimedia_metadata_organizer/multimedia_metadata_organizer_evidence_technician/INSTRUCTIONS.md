# Digital Evidence Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for law enforcement that maintains strict chain of custody for digital media evidence while organizing case-related files with tamper-evident verification, proper documentation, and court-ready exhibit preparation capabilities.

## Persona Description
Officer Rodriguez processes digital media evidence for law enforcement cases. He needs to maintain strict chain of custody while organizing case-related media in a way that's presentable in court proceedings.

## Key Requirements
1. **Tamper-evident metadata verification**: A system ensuring no modifications have occurred since acquisition. This feature is critical because the integrity of digital evidence is paramount in legal proceedings, and the ability to cryptographically verify that files haven't been altered since collection is essential for evidence admissibility and establishing credibility in court.

2. **Chain of custody logging**: Tools documenting every access and modification with officer credentials. This feature is essential because comprehensive audit trails are legally required for all evidence handling, and an automated system that records who accessed files, when they were accessed, and what actions were performed provides irrefutable documentation that can withstand legal scrutiny.

3. **Case hierarchy organization**: Functionality linking evidence to specific cases, charges, and legal statutes. This capability is vital because law enforcement agencies handle numerous cases simultaneously with overlapping evidence, and a structured organization system that connects media directly to legal frameworks ensures proper evidence management and prevents critical files from being overlooked.

4. **Automatic PII detection**: A mechanism for identifying and protecting personally identifiable information. This feature is crucial because digital evidence often contains sensitive information about victims, witnesses, or minors that must be properly redacted before court presentation, and automated detection reduces the risk of inadvertently exposing protected information.

5. **Court exhibit preparation**: Tools generating properly redacted and formatted files for legal proceedings. This functionality is important because evidence must be presented in standardized formats that comply with court requirements, and automatic preparation of exhibits with appropriate redactions, timestamps, and case identifiers streamlines the creation of court-ready materials.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All integrity verification functions must be independently testable
  - Chain of custody logging must create verifiable audit trails
  - Case organization logic must handle complex hierarchical relationships
  - PII detection algorithms must be evaluated against diverse test datasets
  - Exhibit generation must comply with standardized legal formats

- **Performance expectations**:
  - Process and verify large media files (up to 50GB video files)
  - Perform integrity checks in under 1 minute per GB
  - Support concurrent access by multiple authorized users
  - Handle case collections with up to 10,000 individual evidence items
  - Generate court exhibits from source files within 5 minutes

- **Integration points**:
  - Standard digital forensic formats and containers
  - Cryptographic hash verification systems
  - Law enforcement case management systems
  - Legal document preparation standards
  - Digital signature infrastructure

- **Key constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no external UI components
  - Must maintain FIPS 140-2 compliant security standards
  - Must preserve all original files without modification
  - Must handle storage and processing of extremely sensitive data
  - Must support air-gapped systems with no internet connectivity

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide comprehensive APIs for managing digital evidence:

1. **Evidence Integrity Verification**: Calculate and verify cryptographic hashes of evidence files. Detect unauthorized modifications. Create and validate digital signatures. Generate integrity reports for court submission.

2. **Chain of Custody Management**: Document and track all evidence handling events. Maintain secure logs of access and modifications. Require authentication for all operations. Generate comprehensive chain of custody reports.

3. **Case Organization Framework**: Define and manage hierarchical case structures. Link evidence to specific cases, charges, and statutes. Support complex relationships between cases and evidence items. Enable efficient evidence retrieval by case parameters.

4. **Sensitive Information Detection**: Identify personally identifiable information in text, images, and audio. Detect and flag sensitive content that requires special handling. Categorize content by sensitivity level and legal protection status.

5. **Legal Exhibit Generator**: Create court-ready versions of evidence files. Apply appropriate redactions to sensitive information. Format exhibits according to jurisdictional requirements. Prepare evidence packages for legal proceedings.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate detection of file tampering or modification
  - Complete and secure logging of all evidence handling
  - Correct organization of evidence within complex case hierarchies
  - Reliable identification of personally identifiable information
  - Proper generation of redacted exhibits for court

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Processing newly acquired digital evidence into the system
  - Verifying the integrity of evidence after storage or transfer
  - Tracking the complete chain of custody for a sensitive item
  - Preparing a collection of evidence for court proceedings
  - Searching for specific evidence across multiple related cases

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Calculate integrity hashes for 50GB of evidence in under 30 minutes
  - Process 1,000 evidence items into a case structure in under 15 minutes
  - Generate chain of custody reports in under 10 seconds
  - Scan 10GB of text content for PII in under 20 minutes
  - Prepare 100 court exhibits with redactions in under 30 minutes

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Corrupted or incomplete evidence files
  - Attempted unauthorized access or modification
  - Complex nested case hierarchies with shared evidence
  - Evidence containing mixed media types with embedded metadata
  - Ambiguous or novel forms of personally identifiable information
  - Interrupted processing of large evidence files
  - Conflicts between multiple officer actions

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - 99% code coverage for integrity verification functions
  - 99% coverage for chain of custody logging
  - 95% coverage for case organization framework
  - 90% coverage for PII detection algorithms
  - 95% coverage for exhibit generation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. Demonstrates 100% accuracy in detecting unauthorized modifications to evidence files
2. Maintains complete, tamper-evident chain of custody records for all evidence handling
3. Correctly organizes evidence within complex case hierarchies with proper relationships
4. Identifies personally identifiable information with at least 90% accuracy
5. Generates properly formatted and redacted court exhibits that comply with legal standards
6. Passes all test cases with the required coverage metrics
7. Processes evidence efficiently within the performance benchmarks
8. Provides a well-documented API suitable for integration with law enforcement systems
