# Family Heritage Metadata Organization System

## Overview
A specialized metadata management system designed for organizing and preserving family multimedia archives spanning multiple generations. The system enables relationship tagging, generational timelines, voice recognition, collaborative annotation, and event correlation to create a comprehensive, accessible family history archive.

## Persona Description
Miguel is digitizing and organizing decades of family photos, videos, and audio recordings spanning multiple generations. He wants to create a comprehensive family archive that preserves memories and makes them accessible to relatives.

## Key Requirements

1. **Family Relationship Tagging**
   - Creates and maintains connections between individuals across different media types and time periods
   - Critical for Miguel because it establishes the family context for each item and enables browsing by person, relationship, or family branch
   - Must support complex family structures including marriages, divorces, adoptions, and multigenerational relationships while adapting to changes over time

2. **Generational Timeline Visualization**
   - Organizes media chronologically within family generational context
   - Essential for Miguel as it provides historical perspective and shows the progression of family history through visual and audio elements
   - Must handle uncertain dates, date ranges, and organize concurrent events happening to different family branches

3. **Voice Recognition for Audio Identification**
   - Identifies family members in audio recordings based on voice characteristics
   - Valuable for Miguel's preservation of oral histories and voice recordings that might otherwise lose context about who is speaking
   - Must create voice profiles for family members and assist with identifying speakers in historical recordings

4. **Collaborative Annotation**
   - Enables remote family members to contribute identifications and contextual information
   - Important for Miguel because it distributes the work of identification and leverages collective family knowledge
   - Must track contribution sources, resolve conflicting information, and synchronize annotations across the collection

5. **Family Event Correlation**
   - Links media to significant dates and events in family history
   - Crucial for Miguel's goal of preserving context, as it connects media to marriages, births, graduations, holidays, and other milestone events
   - Must support both formal events (weddings, funerals) and informal gatherings, with the ability to define custom event types

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All relationship mapping functions must be independently testable
  - Timeline organization must be verifiable with sample family structures and dated media
  - Voice recognition components must be testable with sample audio files
  - Collaborative annotation mechanisms must verify conflict resolution
  - Event correlation must be testable with simulated family timelines

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle family archives with 10,000+ media items
  - Voice analysis should process audio files at faster than real-time rate
  - Search and retrieval operations should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Must scale efficiently as the family archive grows over decades

- **Integration Points**
  - Standard media metadata formats (EXIF, XMP, ID3)
  - Calendar and date handling for event correlation
  - Audio processing for voice recognition
  - Genealogical data formats for family relationship information

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must be non-destructive to original files and metadata
  - Must handle uncertain, incomplete, or conflicting family information
  - Must respect privacy preferences for sensitive family content
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for family archives with these core capabilities:

1. **Family Relationship Management**
   - Create and maintain a family tree structure
   - Tag individuals across different media types
   - Track relationships and their changes over time

2. **Temporal Organization**
   - Organize media chronologically with generational context
   - Handle uncertain dates and date ranges
   - Create timelines of family events and associated media

3. **Audio and Voice Processing**
   - Analyze and identify speakers in audio recordings
   - Create voice profiles for family members
   - Link oral histories to relevant individuals

4. **Collaborative Features**
   - Enable distributed contribution of identifications and context
   - Track the source of contributed information
   - Resolve conflicts in family metadata

5. **Event and Context Association**
   - Define and categorize family events
   - Associate media with relevant events
   - Capture contextual information about gatherings and milestones

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate creation and maintenance of family relationship networks
  - Correct chronological organization with generational context
  - Successful voice identification in audio recordings
  - Proper handling of collaborative contributions and conflict resolution
  - Accurate association of media with family events

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Adding a newly discovered collection of old family photos
  - Identifying unknown individuals through collaborative input
  - Creating a timeline of a specific family branch
  - Associating media with a significant family event
  - Searching for all media containing a specific family member

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Relationship queries must resolve in under 1 second even for complex family structures
  - Voice analysis must process audio faster than real-time
  - Timeline generation must handle 10,000+ items efficiently
  - System must scale to accommodate growing archives over decades

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Incomplete or uncertain date information
  - Conflicting identifications from multiple family members
  - Complex family structures with multiple marriages and blended families
  - Media featuring individuals before they joined the family
  - Historical recordings with poor audio quality

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for core metadata processing
  - 100% coverage for relationship mapping functions
  - Comprehensive coverage of date handling and timeline generation
  - Complete verification of collaborative contribution mechanisms

## Success Criteria

1. The system successfully organizes media by individual, relationship, and family branch.
2. Generational timelines accurately represent family history through multimedia elements.
3. Voice recognition correctly identifies speakers in at least 80% of clear audio recordings.
4. Collaborative annotation mechanisms successfully integrate contributions from multiple family members.
5. Media is correctly associated with significant events in family history.
6. The system handles incomplete information and uncertain dates gracefully.
7. Search operations efficiently find media based on people, relationships, events, or dates.
8. The system maintains data integrity with no modification of original files.
9. Performance benchmarks are met for archives with 10,000+ media items.
10. All functionality is accessible through well-documented Python APIs without requiring a UI.
