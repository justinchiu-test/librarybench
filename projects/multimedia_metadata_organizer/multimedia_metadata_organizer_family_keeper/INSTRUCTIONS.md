# Family Archive Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for family memory keepers who need to digitize, organize, and make accessible decades of family photos, videos, and audio recordings across multiple generations.

## Persona Description
Miguel is digitizing and organizing decades of family photos, videos, and audio recordings spanning multiple generations. He wants to create a comprehensive family archive that preserves memories and makes them accessible to relatives.

## Key Requirements
1. **Family relationship tagging**: Develop a system that creates connections between individuals across different media types and maintains a family relationship graph. This is essential for navigating the archive by person and understanding the relationships between people appearing in different media over time.

2. **Generational timeline visualization**: Create functionality to organize media chronologically and by generation, showing family history through multimedia elements. This is crucial for understanding the historical context of family events and how family members relate to each other across time.

3. **Voice recognition**: Implement capabilities to help identify family members in audio recordings and oral histories. This is important for preserving knowledge about who is speaking in recordings, especially for older media where this information might otherwise be lost.

4. **Collaborative annotation**: Build a mechanism allowing remote family members to contribute identifications, stories, and context to media items. This enables the entire family to participate in building the archive and preserves knowledge that might otherwise be lost.

5. **Family event correlation**: Create a system that connects media to significant dates in family history such as weddings, births, holidays, and other milestones. This provides crucial context for understanding the significance of photos and recordings.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All metadata management functions must be independently testable
- Mock voice recognition services for testing without audio processing
- Use test fixtures with sample family media and relationship data
- Support isolated testing of collaborative functions

### Performance Expectations
- Handle archives with up to 100,000 media items efficiently
- Process metadata updates in real-time for collaborative features
- Support incremental batch processing for large import operations
- Optimize for occasional use by non-technical family members

### Integration Points
- Multiple media formats (photos, videos, audio recordings, documents)
- Standard metadata formats (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, ID3)
- Voice processing and recognition services
- Calendar systems for event correlation
- Family tree data structures and relationship calculations

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - all functionality exposed through Python APIs
- Must preserve original metadata while adding family-specific enrichment
- Operations must be robust against incomplete or conflicting information
- Must support privacy controls for sensitive family information

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library that enables:

1. **Family Member Identification and Relationships**
   - Create and manage person entities across the archive
   - Define and visualize family relationships
   - Track appearances of individuals across different media types

2. **Temporal Organization and Timelines**
   - Normalize dates across different formats and metadata standards
   - Organize media chronologically and by generation
   - Connect media to significant family events and milestones

3. **Audio and Voice Processing**
   - Process audio recordings to extract speaker information
   - Associate voices with identified family members
   - Transcribe and index spoken content for searching

4. **Collaborative Metadata Enhancement**
   - Support distributed annotation and identification
   - Reconcile potentially conflicting information from multiple sources
   - Track contribution provenance and confidence levels

5. **Family Context and Event Correlation**
   - Define and manage significant family events
   - Associate media with relevant events and milestones
   - Support searching and filtering by event context

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests that verify:

1. **Family Relationship Management**
   - Test creation and maintenance of family relationship graphs
   - Verify correct relationship calculations (e.g., "great-aunt", "second cousin")
   - Test identification and tracking of individuals across media

2. **Timeline Functionality**
   - Test chronological organization with various date formats
   - Verify generational grouping and visualization data
   - Test handling of uncertain or estimated dates

3. **Voice Recognition Integration**
   - Test voice identification functionality with sample recordings
   - Verify association of identified voices with family members
   - Test handling of uncertain identifications

4. **Collaborative Features**
   - Test concurrent metadata additions from multiple sources
   - Verify conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Test provenance tracking for contributed information

5. **Event Correlation**
   - Test association of media with family events
   - Verify filtering and searching by event context
   - Test handling of recurring events (e.g., annual holidays)

**IMPORTANT:**
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Setup Instructions
1. Set up a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project: `uv pip install -e .`

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented
2. The system can accurately track and visualize family relationships across media
3. Generational timeline organization works correctly with various date formats
4. Voice recognition integration successfully helps identify speakers in recordings
5. Collaborative annotation functions support distributed family contributions
6. Family event correlation successfully connects media to significant dates
7. All tests pass when run with pytest
8. A valid pytest_results.json file is generated showing all tests passing

**REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.**
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
