# Family Multimedia Archive Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system designed for preserving and organizing family memories across generations, facilitating the digitization and cataloging of decades of family photos, videos, and audio recordings with rich relational metadata that connects people, events, and timelines.

## Persona Description
Miguel is digitizing and organizing decades of family photos, videos, and audio recordings spanning multiple generations. He wants to create a comprehensive family archive that preserves memories and makes them accessible to relatives.

## Key Requirements
1. **Family relationship tagging**: A system for creating connections between individuals across different media. This feature is critical because it enables building a complete family network that links people across thousands of photos, videos, and recordings, making it possible to trace an individual's presence throughout the entire collection regardless of their age or appearance changes over time.

2. **Generational timeline visualization**: Tools for showing family history through multimedia elements. This feature is essential because it transforms a chaotic collection of disparate media into a chronologically organized narrative that illustrates family evolution over decades, helping younger generations understand their heritage and the connections between historical events and family milestones.

3. **Voice recognition**: Functionality helping identify family members in audio recordings and oral histories. This capability is vital because many family collections include irreplaceable voice recordings (answering machine messages, home movies, recorded stories) where the speakers are unidentified, and this system would preserve voices that might otherwise be lost to memory as older generations pass.

4. **Collaborative annotation**: A mechanism allowing remote family members to contribute identifications. This feature is crucial because no single family member possesses complete knowledge of the extended family, especially for older materials, and enabling distant relatives to collectively identify people, places, and events dramatically improves the completeness and accuracy of the archive.

5. **Family event correlation**: Tools connecting media to significant dates in family history. This functionality is important because it contextualizes isolated media within the framework of meaningful events (birthdays, weddings, holidays, graduations, moves), creating a richer historical narrative and making it easier to find media related to specific milestones.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All relationship mapping functions must be independently testable
  - Timeline generation must be verifiable with test datasets
  - Voice processing algorithms must be evaluated against sample recordings
  - Collaborative annotation flows must be testable with simulated multi-user scenarios
  - Event correlation must be verifiable with known family chronologies

- **Performance expectations**:
  - Process collections of up to 50,000 photos and 1,000 hours of video/audio
  - Support incremental processing as new material is digitized
  - Optimize for occasional use by non-technical family members
  - Maintain reasonable performance on standard consumer hardware

- **Integration points**:
  - Standard photo, video, and audio file formats
  - Common genealogy data formats (GEDCOM)
  - Calendar systems for event correlation
  - Basic face detection for assisted tagging
  - Voice feature extraction for speaker identification

- **Key constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no external UI components
  - Must handle files from multiple decades and formats
  - Must preserve original media while enhancing metadata
  - Must ensure privacy and selective sharing options
  - Should be usable by family members with varying technical expertise

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide comprehensive APIs for managing a family multimedia archive:

1. **Family Network Manager**: Define, visualize, and manage family relationships. Link individuals across the media collection regardless of age or appearance. Support standard genealogical data structures and relationship types. Generate relationship graphs and family trees.

2. **Chronological Timeline Engine**: Organize media along customizable timelines. Extract and standardize dates from various metadata formats. Correlate undated media with known timeline events. Generate views of specific time periods or family branches.

3. **Voice Processing Module**: Extract and analyze voice features from audio recordings. Create voice profiles for family members. Match unidentified speakers to known profiles. Tag and index spoken content for searchability.

4. **Collaborative Contribution System**: Manage input from multiple family members. Reconcile conflicting identifications or date information. Track contribution sources and confidence levels. Implement consensus mechanisms for uncertain identifications.

5. **Event Correlation Framework**: Define and manage significant family events. Link media to relevant events based on dates, people, and content. Generate event-centric collections and highlight key moments in family history.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Accurate mapping of family relationships
  - Correct chronological organization of media
  - Reliable identification of voices in audio recordings
  - Proper handling of collaborative contributions
  - Accurate correlation of media with family events

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Processing a new batch of digitized family photos
  - Building a complete family network across the collection
  - Identifying speakers in historical audio recordings
  - Managing contributions from multiple family members
  - Creating event-based subsets of the family archive

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Process metadata for 1,000 photos in under 10 minutes
  - Generate timeline visualizations in under 30 seconds
  - Analyze 1 hour of audio for voice matching in under 15 minutes
  - Handle concurrent annotation submissions without conflicts
  - Search across complete family archive in under 5 seconds

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Missing or ambiguous dates in historical media
  - Unidentified individuals appearing in multiple items
  - Low-quality audio with multiple overlapping speakers
  - Conflicting person identifications from different family members
  - Ambiguous event associations (multiple events on same date)
  - Incomplete or incorrectly formatted family relationship data

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for family relationship mapping
  - 90% coverage for timeline organization
  - 85% coverage for voice processing functions
  - 95% coverage for collaborative annotation management
  - 90% coverage for event correlation logic

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. Demonstrates accurate modeling of complex family relationships across generations
2. Successfully organizes media chronologically with 90% date accuracy
3. Correctly identifies speakers in audio recordings with at least 75% accuracy
4. Properly manages and reconciles annotations from multiple contributors
5. Accurately correlates media with significant family events
6. Preserves all original metadata while enhancing with new information
7. Passes all test cases with the required coverage metrics
8. Processes typical family collections efficiently within performance benchmarks
