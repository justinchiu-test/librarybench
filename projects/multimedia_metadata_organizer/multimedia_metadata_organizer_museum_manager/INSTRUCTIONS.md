# Museum Collections Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for museum digital collections that implements institutional authority control, tracks exhibition history, maps relationships between artifacts, links conservation documentation, and manages public access controls across multiple departments.

## Persona Description
Elena is responsible for digitizing and cataloging artifacts across multiple museum departments. She needs to implement institutional metadata standards while making the collections accessible to researchers and the public.

## Key Requirements
1. **Institutional authority control**: A system enforcing standardized terminology across departments. This feature is critical because consistent terminology is the backbone of institutional knowledge organization, and implementing controlled vocabularies ensures that different departments (archeology, art, natural history, etc.) use standardized terms for cataloging, making cross-collection searches reliable and precise.

2. **Exhibition history tracking**: Tools showing when and where physical items have been displayed. This feature is essential because tracking an artifact's exhibition history provides valuable provenance information, helps monitor cumulative light exposure and handling, informs future exhibition planning, and creates a comprehensive record of how artifacts have been contextualized and interpreted over time.

3. **Multi-object relationship mapping**: Functionality connecting related artifacts across collections. This capability is vital because museum objects derive significant meaning from their relationships to other items (same creator, same expedition, same historical event, etc.), and systematically mapping these connections reveals cultural contexts and scholarly insights that isolated cataloging would miss.

4. **Conservation documentation linking**: A mechanism for connecting condition reports with visual documentation. This feature is crucial because thorough conservation tracking is fundamental to proper stewardship, and linking condition assessments, treatment records, and visual documentation creates a comprehensive record that informs handling protocols, exhibition decisions, and preservation priorities.

5. **Public access filtering**: Tools determining which metadata fields are visible to different user groups. This functionality is important because museums must balance open access with privacy, cultural sensitivity, and security concerns, and granular control over which metadata is visible to researchers, educators, general public, and staff ensures appropriate access while protecting sensitive information.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All authority control functions must be independently testable
  - Exhibition history tracking must handle complex temporal relationships
  - Relationship mapping must be verifiable with complex collection models
  - Conservation documentation linking must maintain data integrity
  - Access control mechanisms must be tested with multiple user types

- **Performance expectations**:
  - Handle collections with up to 1 million digitized artifacts
  - Support concurrent access by multiple departments
  - Process high-resolution images and 3D scan data efficiently
  - Generate reports and visualizations in under 30 seconds
  - Support incremental updates to collection metadata

- **Integration points**:
  - Standard museum metadata formats (CDWA, LIDO, VRA Core)
  - Institutional digital asset management systems
  - Conservation documentation standards
  - Exhibition planning systems
  - Public-facing collection interfaces

- **Key constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no external UI components
  - Must adhere to museum sector metadata best practices
  - Must support multilingual metadata for international collections
  - Must handle sensitive cultural material appropriately
  - Should accommodate diverse artifact types with specialized metadata needs

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide comprehensive APIs for managing museum digital collections:

1. **Authority Control Framework**: Define, maintain, and enforce controlled vocabularies across departmental collections. Manage thesauri and terminology standards. Support hierarchical term relationships. Facilitate cross-walking between different vocabulary standards.

2. **Exhibition Management System**: Track the complete exhibition history of each artifact. Record location, duration, display conditions, and contextual information. Generate cumulative exposure metrics for conservation purposes. Archive exhibition themes and interpretative contexts.

3. **Relationship Mapping Engine**: Define and visualize connections between artifacts across collections. Implement multiple relationship types (created by, used in, found with, etc.). Support complex relationship networks and hierarchies. Generate relationship visualizations and reports.

4. **Conservation Record Manager**: Link condition assessments, treatment documentation, and visual evidence. Track changes in artifact condition over time. Document conservation interventions with before/after comparisons. Generate conservation priority reports.

5. **Access Control System**: Define visibility rules for different user types. Control access to sensitive metadata fields. Manage cultural protocols for specific collection materials. Generate appropriately filtered metadata exports for different audiences.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Correct enforcement of controlled vocabularies
  - Accurate tracking of exhibition history
  - Proper mapping of inter-object relationships
  - Reliable linking of conservation documentation
  - Appropriate filtering of metadata for different access levels

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Cataloging new acquisitions from multiple departments
  - Planning an exhibition using items from multiple collections
  - Researching relationships between artifacts across departments
  - Documenting conservation treatments with before/after comparison
  - Preparing collection data for public online access

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Authority control validation for 10,000 entries in under 3 minutes
  - Generate exhibition history reports for 1,000 objects in under 30 seconds
  - Map relationships across 100,000 artifacts in under 5 minutes
  - Process conservation documentation for 500 treatments in under 2 minutes
  - Filter access for 50,000 records according to user roles in under 1 minute

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Conflicts between departmental terminology standards
  - Complex exhibition histories (traveling exhibitions, partial displays)
  - Circular or contradictory relationship mappings
  - Incomplete or inconsistent conservation documentation
  - Overlapping or conflicting access control rules
  - Legacy metadata lacking standardized fields
  - Culturally sensitive materials requiring special protocols

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for authority control functions
  - 90% coverage for exhibition history tracking
  - 90% coverage for relationship mapping
  - 95% coverage for conservation documentation linking
  - 95% coverage for access control filtering

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. Demonstrates effective enforcement of controlled vocabularies across departmental collections
2. Successfully tracks exhibition history with comprehensive temporal and contextual information
3. Accurately maps relationships between artifacts with appropriate relationship types
4. Reliably links conservation documentation with condition assessments and visual evidence
5. Appropriately filters metadata access based on user type and sensitivity requirements
6. Passes all test cases with the required coverage metrics
7. Processes museum collections efficiently within the performance benchmarks
8. Provides a well-documented API suitable for integration with museum collection systems
