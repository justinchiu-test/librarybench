# Museum Collections Metadata Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive metadata management system for museum collections that implements institutional standards, tracks exhibition history, maps object relationships, documents conservation status, and controls public access. The system enables efficient cataloging of digitized artifacts while maintaining institutional metadata standards and supporting research access.

## Persona Description
Elena is responsible for digitizing and cataloging artifacts across multiple museum departments. She needs to implement institutional metadata standards while making the collections accessible to researchers and the public.

## Key Requirements

1. **Institutional Authority Control**
   - Enforces standardized terminology and metadata conventions across different departments
   - Critical for Elena because it ensures consistency across the entire museum's digital collections despite departmental differences in cataloging traditions
   - Must implement controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and naming conventions that align with museum standards while supporting department-specific terminology where necessary

2. **Exhibition History Tracking**
   - Documents when and where physical items have been displayed, including loan history
   - Essential for Elena's collection management as it maintains the complete exhibition provenance of each artifact and supports future exhibition planning
   - Must record comprehensive details including dates, locations, exhibition themes, display conditions, and any conservation treatments applied before or after display

3. **Multi-Object Relationship Mapping**
   - Creates connections between related artifacts across different collections and departments
   - Vital for Elena's work as it reveals the contextual relationships between items that might otherwise remain isolated in departmental silos
   - Must support various relationship types (e.g., same creator, same historical period, part of same collection, thematically related) with appropriate metadata for each connection

4. **Conservation Documentation Linking**
   - Associates condition reports and conservation activities with digital representations
   - Crucial for Elena's preservation responsibilities as it maintains the complete conservation history alongside the digital object
   - Must track condition assessments, conservation treatments, material analyses, and restoration activities with comprehensive documentation and before/after imagery

5. **Public Access Filtering**
   - Controls which metadata fields are visible to different user groups
   - Indispensable for Elena's role in making collections accessible while protecting sensitive information
   - Must support different access levels (staff, researchers, public) with field-level control over metadata visibility and appropriate restrictions for culturally sensitive materials

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - Authority control functions must be verifiable against institutional standards
  - Exhibition history tracking must maintain complete temporal records
  - Relationship mapping must be testable for various connection types
  - Conservation documentation must maintain verifiable links to physical records
  - Access control mechanisms must enforce appropriate restrictions

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle museum collections with 500,000+ artifacts
  - Authority control lookups should complete in under 200ms
  - Relationship queries should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Must support concurrent metadata operations from multiple departments

- **Integration Points**
  - Institutional collection management systems
  - Museum authority files and controlled vocabularies
  - Conservation documentation systems
  - Exhibition planning and loan management systems
  - Public-facing digital collection interfaces

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must comply with museum metadata standards (CIDOC CRM, SPECTRUM)
  - Must preserve all versions of metadata with change history
  - Must handle multimedia representing 3D objects (multiple views, 3D scans)
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for museum collections with these core capabilities:

1. **Metadata Standardization and Authority Control**
   - Implement controlled vocabularies and naming conventions
   - Validate metadata against institutional standards
   - Reconcile terminology across different departments

2. **Exhibition and Display Documentation**
   - Track complete exhibition history for physical objects
   - Document loan activities and external display
   - Record display conditions and configurations

3. **Object Relationship Management**
   - Create and maintain connections between related artifacts
   - Document the nature and significance of each relationship
   - Enable navigation across departmental collections

4. **Conservation Status and Treatment**
   - Link condition reports to digital representations
   - Document conservation activities and outcomes
   - Track material analyses and preservation recommendations

5. **Access Control and Visibility Management**
   - Define appropriate access levels for different user groups
   - Control field-level visibility of sensitive metadata
   - Implement cultural protocols for restricted materials

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Correct enforcement of authority control across departments
  - Complete tracking of exhibition history with all relevant details
  - Accurate mapping of relationships between connected objects
  - Proper linking of conservation documentation with digital assets
  - Appropriate filtering of metadata based on access levels

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Cataloging newly digitized artifacts according to institutional standards
  - Recording an item's inclusion in a new exhibition
  - Establishing relationships between newly discovered related objects
  - Documenting conservation treatment with before/after documentation
  - Preparing metadata for public access while protecting sensitive information

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Authority control validation must process at least 10 records per second
  - Relationship queries must efficiently traverse connections across large collections
  - Access control filtering must not significantly impact retrieval performance
  - System must scale to handle collections growing by 50,000+ items annually

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Objects with conflicting attributions or uncertain provenance
  - Items requiring special cultural protocols or access restrictions
  - Complex relationships spanning multiple departments or institutions
  - Artifacts with extensive conservation histories
  - Collection items with incomplete or legacy metadata

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 95% code coverage for authority control mechanisms
  - 100% coverage for access control and filtering functions
  - Comprehensive coverage of relationship mapping logic
  - Complete verification of exhibition history tracking

## Success Criteria

1. The system successfully enforces institutional terminology standards across all departments.
2. Exhibition histories are completely and accurately documented for all displayed items.
3. Relationships between related objects are properly mapped and navigable.
4. Conservation documentation is comprehensively linked to digital representations.
5. Access controls appropriately restrict sensitive metadata based on user type.
6. The system maintains consistent metadata standards while accommodating departmental variations.
7. Performance benchmarks are met for collections with 500,000+ items.
8. The system handles complex objects and relationships appropriately.
9. All operations maintain complete audit trails and version history.
10. All functionality is accessible through well-documented Python APIs without requiring a UI.
