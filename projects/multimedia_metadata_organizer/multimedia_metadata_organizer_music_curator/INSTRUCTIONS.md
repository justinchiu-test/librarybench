# Music Collection Metadata Standardization System

## Overview
A specialized metadata management system for music libraries that standardizes inconsistent metadata across multiple sources and formats. The system employs audio fingerprinting, music-specific taxonomies, discography completion, artist role clarification, and listening history integration to create a unified music experience.

## Persona Description
Aisha manages a vast personal music library spanning multiple formats from vinyl rips to streaming purchases. She needs to standardize inconsistent metadata across sources to create a unified listening experience.

## Key Requirements

1. **Audio Fingerprinting**
   - Identifies untitled or mislabeled tracks through acoustic signature analysis
   - Critical for Aisha because it resolves the common problem of incorrectly labeled tracks from various sources, particularly from vinyl rips or tracks with ambiguous titles
   - Must match audio content against reference databases to determine the correct track information regardless of file naming or existing metadata

2. **Music-Specific Taxonomies**
   - Implements comprehensive classification systems for genre, mood, and thematic content
   - Essential for Aisha's organization as it enables consistent categorization across her diverse collection and supports sophisticated filtering and playlist generation
   - Must support multiple overlapping taxonomies including traditional genres, mood-based categories, instrumental characteristics, and cultural contexts

3. **Discography Completion**
   - Detects missing tracks or albums within artist collections
   - Valuable for Aisha's completionist approach to collecting music, helping identify gaps in artist catalogs or album collections
   - Must compare existing library contents against authoritative discography data to identify missing items and track collection completeness

4. **Performance Role Distinction**
   - Differentiates between primary artists, featured guests, session musicians, producers, and other contributors
   - Important for Aisha's ability to accurately track artist collaborations and properly attribute creative contributions
   - Must standardize inconsistent artist role designations and create proper relationship mapping between tracks and all contributors

5. **Listening History Integration**
   - Tracks personal ratings, play counts, and favorites across different platforms
   - Crucial for Aisha's music discovery and appreciation, as it preserves her listening patterns and preferences regardless of source
   - Must consolidate play history and ratings from multiple sources and apply them consistently across the unified library

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - Audio fingerprinting algorithms must be testable with sample audio files
  - Taxonomy classification must be verifiable against reference genre mappings
  - Discography completion must be testable against known artist catalogs
  - Artist role parsing and standardization must handle varied input formats
  - History integration must correctly merge data from multiple sources

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle libraries of 100,000+ tracks
  - Audio fingerprinting should process tracks at faster than real-time rate
  - Metadata standardization should process at least 10 tracks per second
  - Search operations should return results in under 1 second

- **Integration Points**
  - Standard audio metadata formats (ID3, Vorbis comments, etc.)
  - Audio fingerprinting reference databases
  - Authoritative music databases for discography information
  - External play history and rating sources

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must be non-destructive to original audio files
  - Must handle multiple audio formats (MP3, FLAC, AAC, etc.)
  - Must work with offline libraries without requiring constant internet access
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for music collections with these core capabilities:

1. **Audio Analysis and Identification**
   - Generate acoustic fingerprints from audio content
   - Match fingerprints against reference databases
   - Correct mislabeled or unidentified tracks

2. **Metadata Standardization**
   - Normalize inconsistent artist, album, and track naming
   - Reconcile conflicting metadata from different sources
   - Apply consistent formatting rules across the collection

3. **Music Organization and Classification**
   - Apply genre, mood, and theme taxonomies
   - Track album completeness and artist discographies
   - Organize music by various attributes beyond basic metadata

4. **Contributor and Role Management**
   - Parse and standardize artist role information
   - Distinguish between different types of contributors
   - Create relationship networks between artists and tracks

5. **Personal Preference Tracking**
   - Integrate listening history from multiple sources
   - Maintain consistent rating systems
   - Preserve user preference data across format changes

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate identification of tracks through audio fingerprinting
  - Correct application of genre and mood taxonomies
  - Proper detection of missing items in discographies
  - Accurate differentiation of artist roles and contributions
  - Successful integration of listening history from multiple sources

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Identifying and correcting metadata for a batch of unlabeled tracks
  - Organizing a collection using consistent genre classifications
  - Analyzing an artist's discography to identify missing albums or tracks
  - Standardizing contributor credits across a collection
  - Preserving listening history when reorganizing the library

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Audio fingerprinting must process tracks at 10x real-time or faster
  - Metadata standardization must handle at least 10 tracks per second
  - Library analysis must scale efficiently to collections of 100,000+ tracks
  - System must perform consistently with limited memory footprint

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Tracks with no matches in fingerprint databases
  - Artists with ambiguous names or multiple artists with the same name
  - Compilation albums and various artist collections
  - Classical music with complex performer/composer relationships
  - Tracks with dramatically different metadata across sources

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for core metadata processing
  - 100% coverage for fingerprinting and identification functions
  - Comprehensive coverage of taxonomy application logic
  - Complete verification of history merging algorithms

## Success Criteria

1. The system successfully identifies at least 90% of unidentified tracks through audio fingerprinting.
2. Genre, mood, and theme classifications are consistently applied across the entire library.
3. Discography analysis correctly identifies missing albums and tracks for artists.
4. Artist roles and contributions are properly differentiated and standardized.
5. Listening history and ratings are successfully integrated from multiple sources.
6. The system standardizes metadata across different formats and sources.
7. Performance benchmarks are met for libraries of 100,000+ tracks.
8. The system handles edge cases and unusual metadata patterns gracefully.
9. All operations maintain data integrity with no corruption of audio files.
10. All functionality is accessible through well-documented Python APIs without requiring a UI.
