# Scientific Research Media Metadata System

## Overview
A specialized metadata management system for scientific researchers that organizes research media with scientific taxonomies, protocol linkages, geospatial mapping, specimen tracking, and publication preparation features. The system enables efficient organization of research media within scientific frameworks while maintaining connections to study methodologies and findings.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel conducts marine biology research generating thousands of underwater photographs and videos. She needs to organize research media with scientific metadata that connects to her study protocols and findings.

## Key Requirements

1. **Scientific Taxonomy Integration**
   - Implements standardized species classification systems and scientific naming conventions
   - Critical for Dr. Patel because it organizes observations according to formal biological taxonomy, ensuring scientific accuracy and enabling analysis across taxonomic hierarchies
   - Must support multiple taxonomy standards (e.g., ITIS, WoRMS) with proper handling of scientific nomenclature, taxonomic ranks, and phylogenetic relationships

2. **Research Protocol Linking**
   - Connects media to specific experiments, methodologies, and research questions
   - Essential for Dr. Patel's scientific rigor as it maintains the methodological context for each observation and ensures reproducibility
   - Must track experimental conditions, equipment configurations, and protocol versions associated with each media item

3. **Geospatial Habitat Mapping**
   - Places observations within ecological and geographical contexts
   - Crucial for Dr. Patel's spatial analysis as it enables correlation between species observations and environmental factors
   - Must support marine-specific coordinate systems, depth measurements, and habitat classification schemes

4. **Specimen Tracking**
   - Associates multiple observations of the same individual organism over time
   - Valuable for Dr. Patel's longitudinal studies as it allows tracking changes in specific organisms and establishing observation histories
   - Must create and maintain reliable specimen identifiers and relationship networks between observations of the same individual

5. **Publication Preparation**
   - Extracts appropriate media and metadata for journal submissions and presentations
   - Indispensable for Dr. Patel's research dissemination as it streamlines the preparation of visual materials for scientific publication
   - Must generate publication-ready media with properly formatted scientific metadata according to journal requirements

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - Taxonomy classification functions must be independently testable against reference databases
  - Protocol linking must verify correct relationship mapping
  - Geospatial functions must be testable with known coordinate sets
  - Specimen tracking must verify identity relationships across observations
  - Publication outputs must validate against scientific journal specifications

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle research collections with 50,000+ media items
  - Taxonomy lookups should complete in under 500ms
  - Geospatial queries should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Must support batch processing of at least 1,000 items for metadata operations

- **Integration Points**
  - Standard scientific taxonomy databases (ITIS, WoRMS, etc.)
  - Geographic information systems and coordinate reference systems
  - Research protocol documentation formats
  - Scientific publication metadata standards and formats

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must preserve raw scientific data without modification
  - Must maintain precise provenance for all metadata
  - Must handle specialized scientific file formats
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for scientific research with these core capabilities:

1. **Scientific Classification and Identification**
   - Apply taxonomic classification to observed organisms
   - Validate scientific nomenclature against reference databases
   - Track taxonomic revisions and naming changes

2. **Research Context Management**
   - Link media to specific research protocols and questions
   - Document experimental conditions and methodologies
   - Track equipment configurations and calibration status

3. **Spatial and Environmental Documentation**
   - Record precise location data including depth/altitude
   - Classify and document habitat characteristics
   - Enable spatial analysis across observation sets

4. **Individual Organism Tracking**
   - Establish and maintain specimen identifiers
   - Link multiple observations of the same individual
   - Document changes in individual organisms over time

5. **Scientific Output Preparation**
   - Generate publication-ready media with appropriate metadata
   - Format citations and attributions according to scientific standards
   - Prepare data packages for journal submission or data repositories

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate application of taxonomic classifications
  - Correct linking between media and research protocols
  - Precise geospatial mapping and habitat classification
  - Reliable tracking of individual specimens across observations
  - Proper formatting of publication outputs according to requirements

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Processing new media from a research expedition
  - Searching for observations by taxonomic classification
  - Analyzing spatial distribution of species observations
  - Tracking changes in specific specimens over time
  - Preparing media packages for journal publication

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Taxonomy lookups must complete in under 500ms even for complex hierarchies
  - Spatial queries must efficiently handle complex region definitions
  - Batch processing must handle at least 1,000 items simultaneously
  - System must scale to manage research collections growing over many years

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Organisms with uncertain or disputed taxonomic classification
  - Observations with incomplete location data
  - Ambiguous specimen identification
  - Equipment malfunctions affecting metadata reliability
  - Changes in taxonomic classification systems over time

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 95% code coverage for taxonomy functions
  - 100% coverage for geospatial coordinate handling
  - Comprehensive coverage of specimen relationship mapping
  - Complete verification of publication output formatting

## Success Criteria

1. The system successfully applies correct taxonomic classifications to at least 98% of identifiable organisms.
2. Research protocol information is accurately linked to all media with complete methodological context.
3. Geospatial data is precisely recorded and mapped with appropriate coordinate systems and depth measurements.
4. Individual specimens are reliably tracked across multiple observations over time.
5. Publication outputs meet the formatting requirements of major scientific journals.
6. The system handles taxonomy revisions and scientific nomenclature changes appropriately.
7. Search operations efficiently find media based on scientific, spatial, or methodological criteria.
8. Performance benchmarks are met for research collections with 50,000+ media items.
9. The system maintains data integrity with no modification of original scientific observations.
10. All functionality is accessible through well-documented Python APIs without requiring a UI.
