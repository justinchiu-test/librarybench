# Video Production Metadata Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive metadata management system for video production that organizes raw footage, tracks production status, monitors licensing, integrates with editing workflows, and identifies content sensitivity concerns. The system enables efficient post-production workflows while maintaining detailed relationships between source material and final edited sequences.

## Persona Description
Sophia oversees post-production for a documentary film studio managing terabytes of interview footage, B-roll, and archival material. She needs to organize raw footage and track the relationships between source material and final edited sequences.

## Key Requirements

1. **Interview Transcription Linking**
   - Automatically associates transcribed text with timecodes and speaker identification
   - Critical for Sophia because it makes interview content searchable by keyword while maintaining synchronization with the original footage
   - Must correctly identify different speakers and link their statements to corresponding video segments, enabling quick location of specific quotes or topics within hours of interview footage

2. **Production Status Tracking**
   - Monitors the progress of footage through the production workflow
   - Essential for Sophia's role as it provides visibility into which clips have been reviewed, selected for potential use, included in rough cuts, or incorporated into final edits
   - Must maintain a complete history of status changes and editorial decisions to support production management and client reviews

3. **Licensing Status Monitoring**
   - Tracks usage rights, permissions, and expiration dates for all footage
   - Vital for Sophia's legal compliance as it prevents the inclusion of footage with expired or inappropriate licensing in final productions
   - Must provide alerts for approaching expirations and clear indicators of usage limitations for archival or third-party material

4. **Edit Decision List Integration**
   - Maps relationships between raw source footage and final edited sequences
   - Indispensable for Sophia's editorial process as it maintains the connections between original material and its appearance in edited timelines
   - Must track which segments of source clips are used in each edit version, including precise in/out points and any applied transformations

5. **Content Sensitivity Flagging**
   - Identifies footage containing potentially sensitive, controversial, or restricted content
   - Crucial for Sophia's risk management as it helps prevent the accidental inclusion of inappropriate material in final productions
   - Must support customizable sensitivity categories and provide clear warnings when flagged content is accessed or included in edits

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All metadata extraction and association functions must be independently testable
  - Transcription linking must be verifiable with sample audio/video and text
  - Status tracking state transitions must be fully testable
  - Licensing expiration alerts must be testable with simulated time progression
  - Edit relationship tracking must verify bidirectional connections between source and output

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must efficiently handle projects with 100+ hours of source footage
  - Metadata extraction and indexing should process video at faster than real-time rate
  - Search operations across transcriptions should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Status updates and relationship tracking must handle concurrent operations from multiple users

- **Integration Points**
  - Standard video metadata formats (XMP, MXF metadata)
  - Common transcription formats (SRT, VTT)
  - Edit decision list (EDL) and project file formats
  - Industry-standard timecode formats and frame rate handling

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must be non-destructive to original video files and metadata
  - Must handle mixed frame rates and timecode formats
  - Must scale to documentary projects with thousands of individual clips
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through Python APIs

## Core Functionality

The system must provide comprehensive metadata management for video production with these core capabilities:

1. **Video Metadata Extraction and Organization**
   - Extract technical metadata from various video formats
   - Organize footage by project, shoot date, and content type
   - Create searchable indexes of video content and metadata

2. **Transcription and Content Analysis**
   - Link transcribed text with corresponding video segments
   - Identify and differentiate speakers in interview footage
   - Enable content search across transcriptions and associated metadata

3. **Production Workflow Tracking**
   - Monitor the status of footage through the editorial process
   - Track editorial decisions and clip selections
   - Maintain history of status changes and usage

4. **Rights and Compliance Management**
   - Track licensing terms, restrictions, and expirations
   - Flag content with sensitivity or compliance concerns
   - Ensure all used footage has appropriate permissions

5. **Editorial Relationship Mapping**
   - Maintain bidirectional links between source footage and edited sequences
   - Track which portions of source clips appear in various edits
   - Document the transformations applied to footage in final productions

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate extraction of video metadata from various formats
  - Correct synchronization of transcriptions with video timecodes
  - Proper tracking of clip status throughout the production workflow
  - Accurate monitoring of licensing terms and expiration dates
  - Complete mapping between source footage and edited sequences
  - Effective identification and flagging of sensitive content

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Processing newly acquired footage into the production system
  - Searching for specific content across hours of interview material
  - Tracking which raw clips have been used in which edited sequences
  - Verifying licensing compliance for an entire production
  - Identifying all instances where flagged sensitive content appears

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Metadata extraction must process video faster than real-time
  - Transcript linking must accurately synchronize at least 95% of dialogue
  - Search operations must locate content within seconds even across large projects
  - System must scale to handle projects with 100+ hours of source material

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Mixed frame rates and timecode formats within a single project
  - Discontinuous timecode in source footage
  - Complex edit operations (speed changes, reverse clips, nested sequences)
  - Partial or incomplete licensing information
  - Conflicting metadata from different sources

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for core metadata processing
  - 100% coverage for licensing and sensitivity tracking functions
  - Comprehensive coverage of timecode and edit relationship mapping
  - Complete verification of state transitions in status tracking

## Success Criteria

1. The system successfully extracts and organizes metadata from at least 95% of common video formats.
2. Transcriptions are correctly linked to video segments with speaker identification.
3. Production status is accurately tracked throughout the editorial workflow.
4. Licensing terms are properly monitored with timely expiration alerts.
5. Edit decision lists correctly map relationships between source and output.
6. Sensitive content is appropriately flagged and warnings are generated when used.
7. Search operations find relevant content within seconds across large projects.
8. The system maintains data integrity with no modification of original files.
9. Performance benchmarks are met for projects with 100+ hours of footage.
10. All functionality is accessible through well-documented Python APIs without requiring a UI.
