# Accessible Content Analysis Toolkit

A specialized natural language processing framework for analyzing and improving text clarity, simplifying complex content, and optimizing digital materials for people with cognitive or reading disabilities.

## Overview

This project provides content accessibility specialists with powerful tools to analyze text complexity, identify clarity issues, suggest simplifications, and ensure digital content meets accessibility guidelines. The toolkit focuses on plain language conversion, sentence structure simplification, cognitive load estimation, jargon detection, and screen reader optimization.

## Persona Description

Miguel ensures digital content meets accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities. He needs to analyze text complexity, identify clarity issues, and suggest improvements to make content more accessible to people with cognitive or reading disabilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Plain Language Conversion Engine**: Develop algorithms to identify complex terminology and suggest simpler alternatives while preserving the original meaning of the content.
   - This feature is critical for Miguel as it enables him to transform specialized or technical content into language that's more accessible to users with cognitive disabilities or limited reading proficiency.
   - The system must distinguish between necessary technical terms that should be explained and unnecessarily complex language that can be simplified without losing meaning.

2. **Sentence Structure Simplification**: Create tools to identify and reformat complex syntactic patterns that may pose cognitive barriers, such as double negatives, long embedded clauses, and passive voice constructions.
   - This capability allows Miguel to restructure difficult-to-process sentences into clearer, more direct statements that reduce cognitive load for users with reading disabilities.
   - The simplification must preserve the semantic content while making structural changes that improve readability and comprehension.

3. **Cognitive Load Estimation Framework**: Implement a system to measure the processing demands of different text sections based on linguistic complexity, information density, and structural factors.
   - This feature helps Miguel identify content sections that may overwhelm readers with cognitive disabilities, allowing prioritization of the most challenging areas for revision.
   - The estimation must consider multiple factors beyond simple readability formulas, including abstract reasoning requirements, working memory demands, and attentional load.

4. **Jargon and Abbreviation Detection**: Build a comprehensive system to highlight specialized terminology, acronyms, and abbreviations that require explanation for general audience comprehension.
   - This capability ensures Miguel can identify domain-specific language that creates barriers for users with cognitive disabilities or limited background knowledge.
   - The detection must recognize both obvious technical terms and subtle professional jargon that content creators might not realize needs explanation.

5. **Screen Reader Optimization Analysis**: Develop tools to evaluate how content will be experienced through screen readers and suggest structural improvements for better audio presentation.
   - This feature is essential for Miguel to ensure content is equally accessible to users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers, especially those who also have cognitive disabilities.
   - The analysis must consider how text structure, formatting, and organization affect the screen reader experience and suggest improvements that benefit both audio and visual users.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All language simplification suggestions must be testable against readability metrics
- Sentence restructuring algorithms must produce measurable complexity reductions
- Cognitive load estimates must correlate with established accessibility guidelines
- Jargon detection must be verifiable against domain-specific term dictionaries
- Screen reader optimizations must be testable for improved linear presentation

### Performance Expectations
- Process and analyze documents up to 50,000 words in under 30 seconds
- Generate plain language alternatives in real-time for interactive use
- Complete comprehensive accessibility analysis of typical web pages (<10,000 words) in under 5 seconds
- Support batch processing of multiple documents for large-scale content audits
- Handle content with diverse formatting, structure, and technical complexity

### Integration Points
- Accept content in common formats (HTML, Markdown, DOCX, PDF, plain text)
- Provide programmatic access to all analysis results
- Export suggestions in formats suitable for content management systems
- Support integration with accessibility standards (WCAG, ADA, Section 508)
- Enable customization for different target audiences and accessibility needs

### Key Constraints
- Implementation must use only Python standard library
- Analysis must work without reliance on external APIs or services
- System must handle diverse content domains without domain-specific training
- Suggestions must balance accessibility with preservation of essential meaning
- Processing must be adaptable to different target audience cognitive profiles
- All components must be independently testable and verifiable

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Plain Language Converter**: A framework for identifying and simplifying complex language. It should:
   - Detect overly complex or specialized vocabulary
   - Suggest simpler alternatives that preserve meaning
   - Recognize when technical terms must be retained and need explanation
   - Support different target reading levels for suggestions
   - Maintain a balance between simplicity and precision

2. **Syntactic Simplification Engine**: A system for restructuring complex sentences. It should:
   - Identify sentences with difficult syntactic structures
   - Recognize passive voice, double negatives, and embedded clauses
   - Suggest restructuring into simpler, more direct patterns
   - Split long sentences into more manageable units
   - Preserve semantic relationships while simplifying structure

3. **Cognitive Accessibility Analyzer**: A framework for estimating processing demands. It should:
   - Calculate cognitive load based on multiple linguistic factors
   - Measure information density and conceptual complexity
   - Identify sections requiring high working memory capacity
   - Evaluate abstract reasoning demands in the content
   - Generate section-by-section cognitive accessibility scores

4. **Terminology Management System**: A tool for detecting specialized language. It should:
   - Identify domain-specific terminology and professional jargon
   - Detect acronyms and abbreviations requiring expansion
   - Recognize subtle jargon that appears to be common language
   - Suggest explanations for necessary technical terms
   - Track consistency of terminology use throughout documents

5. **Screen Reader Experience Optimizer**: A framework for audio presentation analysis. It should:
   - Evaluate content structure from a linear audio perspective
   - Identify elements that create confusion in audio presentation
   - Suggest improvements for headings, lists, and navigation elements
   - Analyze descriptive text adequacy for non-textual elements
   - Recommend structural changes to improve the listening experience
