# Accessible Content Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for accessibility specialists to analyze text complexity, identify clarity issues, and generate recommendations to make digital content more accessible for people with cognitive or reading disabilities.

## Persona Description
Miguel ensures digital content meets accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities. He needs to analyze text complexity, identify clarity issues, and suggest improvements to make content more accessible to people with cognitive or reading disabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **Plain Language Conversion**: Develop algorithms to identify complex terminology, jargon, and unnecessarily difficult wording, suggesting simpler alternatives that maintain the original meaning. This is essential for making content accessible to people with cognitive disabilities, lower literacy levels, or non-native language speakers who struggle with advanced vocabulary and complex phrasing.

2. **Sentence Structure Simplification**: Implement analysis and transformation capabilities to identify and reformat complicated syntactic patterns, including long sentences, passive voice, nested clauses, and convoluted structures. This addresses cognitive processing challenges by reducing the working memory load required to parse and comprehend content.

3. **Cognitive Load Estimation**: Create quantitative measures for estimating the processing demands of different text sections based on linguistic complexity, information density, abstraction level, and prerequisite knowledge. This helps identify content that may overwhelm users with cognitive limitations, allowing targeted simplification of the most challenging sections.

4. **Jargon and Abbreviation Detection**: Build pattern recognition to highlight specialized terms, technical language, abbreviations, and acronyms requiring explanation, with suggestions for clear definitions or replacements. This prevents accessibility barriers created by assumed knowledge and specialized vocabulary that excludes many users.

5. **Screen Reader Optimization**: Develop analysis tools to ensure content is structured appropriately for audio presentation, including proper heading hierarchy, meaningful link text, image alternatives, and pronunciation guidance for unusual terms. This enhances accessibility for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers to access digital content.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All analysis algorithms must produce consistent, deterministic results
  - Readability metrics must align with established accessibility standards
  - Plain language recommendations must maintain semantic equivalence
  - All transformations must preserve essential meaning and information
  - Results must be reproducible across different text types

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Process website-scale content (50+ pages) in reasonable timeframes
  - Support incremental analysis for content updates
  - Handle document-length text (10K+ words) efficiently
  - Generate recommendations in near real-time for interactive use
  - Maintain performance with diverse content types and structures

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for common content formats (HTML, Markdown, DOCX, etc.)
  - Alignment with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards
  - Integration with readability frameworks (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, etc.)
  - Export capabilities for accessibility audit reports
  - Support for custom terminology dictionaries and plain language standards

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Maintain high precision to prevent meaning distortion
  - Respect diverse reading abilities and cognitive profiles
  - Support for multilingual content where possible
  - Balance simplification with information preservation

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. Text complexity analysis frameworks for:
   - Vocabulary complexity assessment
   - Sentence structure and syntax analysis
   - Reading level estimation using multiple methodologies
   - Information density and cognitive load calculation
   - Document structure and organization evaluation

2. Plain language transformation capabilities:
   - Complex vocabulary identification and simplification
   - Sentence restructuring and length optimization
   - Passive voice identification and active voice conversion
   - Nominalization detection and verbification
   - Abstract concept concretization

3. Specialized content accessibility analysis:
   - Technical jargon and specialized terminology detection
   - Abbreviation and acronym identification
   - Cultural reference and idiom recognition
   - Assumed knowledge assessment
   - Ambiguity and multiple meaning detection

4. Screen reader and assistive technology optimization:
   - Document structure analysis for logical flow
   - Heading hierarchy verification
   - Link text meaningfulness assessment
   - Alternative text evaluation and recommendations
   - Pronunciation guidance generation for unusual terms

5. Accessibility improvement recommendation engines:
   - Plain language alternatives with equivalent meanings
   - Structure simplification with content preservation
   - Explanation generation for necessary complex terms
   - Format and presentation optimization
   - Progressive complexity implementation for layered access

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of complexity analysis against established readability metrics
  - Semantic preservation in plain language conversions
  - Precision of jargon and abbreviation detection
  - Effectiveness of screen reader optimization recommendations
  - Compliance of output with accessibility guidelines

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Analyzing technical documentation for accessibility barriers
  - Simplifying educational content for diverse learning abilities
  - Optimizing public health information for universal understanding
  - Evaluating legal notices for plain language compliance
  - Ensuring digital interfaces have accessible instructions

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Complete analysis of 10,000-word documents in under 2 minutes
  - Process website content (50+ pages) in under 10 minutes
  - Generate meaningful recommendations for 90%+ of identified issues
  - Achieve readability improvements of at least 20% for complex texts
  - Maintain accuracy across different content domains and types

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling highly technical or specialized content
  - Processing multilingual or code-switching texts
  - Managing content with necessary complexity (e.g., legal requirements)
  - Analyzing texts with unconventional structures or formats
  - Balancing simplification with precision in scientific content

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90%+ coverage of all analysis algorithms
  - Comprehensive testing of transformation recommendations
  - Validation against established accessibility standards
  - Testing with diverse text types (technical, educational, legal, etc.)
  - Verification with actual screen reader technologies

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
