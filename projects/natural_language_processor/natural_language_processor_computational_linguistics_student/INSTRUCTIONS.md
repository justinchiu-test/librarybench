# Educational NLP Algorithm Toolkit

A natural language processing library designed specifically for computational linguistics students to learn through implementation and experimentation.

## Overview

This project provides a transparent, educational implementation of core NLP algorithms with visualization, comparison, and annotation capabilities. It allows computational linguistics students to understand algorithm behavior by seeing step-by-step processing, comparing different approaches, and connecting implementations to linguistic theory.

## Persona Description

Maya is a graduate student studying computational linguistics who wants to understand NLP algorithms by implementing them from scratch rather than using black-box libraries. Her primary goal is to gain deep intuition about how language processing techniques work while building a portfolio project for future job applications.

## Key Requirements

1. **Algorithm Visualization Tools**: Implement step-by-step visualization capabilities for NLP pipeline processing, showing how text transforms through each stage of analysis. This feature is critical for Maya because it reveals the internal mechanics of algorithms that are typically hidden in production libraries, enabling deeper understanding of linguistic transformations.

2. **Comparative Analysis Framework**: Create a system to test different algorithmic approaches on the same NLP task (e.g., different tokenization or POS tagging strategies), with performance metrics and output comparisons. This allows Maya to understand the tradeoffs between different methods and develop critical analysis skills valuable for research and professional work.

3. **Academic Paper Implementation Templates**: Develop a framework for implementing algorithms from academic papers, with structured templates that connect formal descriptions to code. This feature helps Maya build a bridge between academic literature and practical implementation, reinforcing theoretical concepts through coding.

4. **Performance Profiling Tools**: Build comprehensive performance measurement capabilities that highlight algorithmic complexity, memory usage, and processing bottlenecks. This is essential for Maya to understand the real-world implications of algorithm design choices and develop optimization skills crucial for computational linguists.

5. **Linguistic Theory Annotations**: Create a system to annotate code implementations with formal linguistic concepts, theoretical foundations, and relevant academic references. This connects implementation details to the broader linguistic theories Maya is studying, deepening her understanding of how computational methods relate to language theory.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All algorithm steps must be individually testable with input/output validation
- Visualization outputs must be serializable and comparable for testing
- Comparative analysis results must be deterministic and reproducible
- Performance metrics must be measurable and consistent across test runs
- Theory annotations must be programmatically accessible and testable

### Performance Expectations
- All algorithms must execute with clearly documented time and space complexity
- Test suite should provide performance benchmarks against standard datasets
- Visualization tools should have minimal overhead on algorithm execution time
- Core NLP functions should accommodate texts of at least 1MB in reasonable time (< 1 minute)
- Memory usage should be optimized for educational laptops (4-8GB RAM)

### Integration Points
- Input/output formats compatible with standard NLP datasets and corpora
- Export capabilities for visualization data to common formats (JSON, CSV)
- Academic paper templates should accept BibTeX citations and paper references
- Performance data exportable to common analysis formats
- Optional integration with educational visualization libraries

### Key Constraints
- Implementation must use only Python standard library (no external NLP libraries)
- All algorithms must be implemented from first principles with educational comments
- Visualization must be text-based or serializable (no GUI components)
- Code must prioritize clarity and educational value over maximum performance
- API design should follow consistent educational patterns across all modules

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

1. **NLP Pipeline Framework**
   - Modular pipeline architecture supporting standard NLP stages (tokenization, normalization, POS tagging, parsing, etc.)
   - Transparent data flow between pipeline stages with inspection capabilities
   - Customizable pipeline configuration and component substitution

2. **Algorithm Implementation Layer**
   - Clean, well-documented implementations of fundamental NLP algorithms
   - Rule-based and statistical approaches to each core NLP task
   - Step-tracing capability to capture algorithm state at each processing step

3. **Visualization and Analysis System**
   - Text-based visualization of algorithm progression and transformations
   - Comparative output generation showing differences between approaches
   - Performance metrics collection and reporting framework

4. **Linguistic Theory Integration**
   - Annotation system connecting code to linguistic concepts
   - References to standard literature and academic foundations
   - Theory-to-implementation mapping documentation

5. **Educational Utilities**
   - Paper implementation templates with structure guidance

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct implementation of core NLP algorithms (tokenization, POS tagging, parsing, etc.)
- Accurate visualization of processing steps showing intermediate states
- Proper comparative analysis with meaningful metrics between algorithm variants
- Accurate performance profiling with consistent metrics across runs
- Correct association between code implementations and linguistic theory

### Critical User Scenarios
- Implementing and visualizing a new tokenization algorithm from an academic paper
- Comparing multiple part-of-speech tagging approaches on the same text corpus
- Profiling and optimizing a computationally intensive parsing algorithm
- Annotating a sentiment analysis implementation with relevant linguistic theory
- Running comparative analysis on multiple variants of the same algorithm

### Performance Benchmarks
- Pipeline processing speed for standard test corpora (e.g., Brown corpus sections)
- Memory usage across different algorithm variants and text sizes
- Visualization performance with large processing traces
- Comparison runtime for algorithm variants on standard test cases
- Library initialization and configuration time

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of unusual linguistic phenomena (rare punctuation, non-standard orthography)
- Boundary conditions in statistical algorithms (zero counts, unseen events)
- Resource constraints (very large texts, memory limitations)
- Invalid algorithm configurations or incompatible pipeline components
- Malformed input text or corruption in training data

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for all algorithm implementations
- 100% coverage for visualization and comparison frameworks
- 90% coverage for performance profiling components
- 95% coverage for academic paper implementation templates
- 90% coverage for theory annotation systems

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
