# Accessibility Text Processor

A natural language processing library designed to analyze and improve content accessibility for people with disabilities.

## Overview

This project provides tools to evaluate text complexity, improve readability, simplify language, detect specialized terminology, and optimize content for screen readers. It helps accessibility specialists ensure digital content is accessible to people with cognitive or reading disabilities.

## Persona Description

Miguel ensures digital content meets accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities. He needs to analyze text complexity, identify clarity issues, and suggest improvements to make content more accessible to people with cognitive or reading disabilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Plain Language Conversion**: Develop algorithms to identify complex terminology, jargon, and abstract language with automatic suggestion of simpler alternatives. This feature is critical for Miguel because transforming specialized or complex language into plain language is a fundamental requirement for cognitive accessibility, allowing users with reading or processing limitations to understand content without needing specialized knowledge.

2. **Sentence Structure Simplification**: Create pattern recognition for complicated syntactic structures (passive voice, nested clauses, long sentences) with recommendations for clearer alternatives. This capability allows Miguel to systematically identify and improve sentence complexity issues that create barriers for people with cognitive disabilities, learning disabilities, or non-native speakers.

3. **Cognitive Load Estimation**: Build metrics to measure processing demands of different text sections based on sentence length, structural complexity, vocabulary difficulty, and information density. For Miguel, quantifying cognitive accessibility allows objective measurement of improvements and helps prioritize which content sections need the most attention to meet accessibility standards.

4. **Jargon and Abbreviation Detection**: Implement specialized recognition for field-specific terminology, technical jargon, and unexplained abbreviations that require definition. This feature helps Miguel identify terms that need explanation or simplification, ensuring content doesn't exclude users who lack specialized domain knowledge.

5. **Screen Reader Optimization**: Develop analysis tools for content structure, ensuring appropriate heading hierarchy, alt text completeness, and proper handling of non-standard text elements for audio presentation. This capability enables Miguel to optimize content specifically for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers, ensuring the logical flow remains clear when experienced auditorily rather than visually.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All text transformations must be reversible for testing effectiveness
- Plain language suggestions must be validated against established simplification guidelines
- Cognitive load metrics must correlate with established readability frameworks
- Screen reader compatibility must be testable against WCAG standards
- Jargon detection must be benchmarkable against domain-specific glossaries

### Performance Expectations
- Process standard web pages (2000-5000 words) in under 10 seconds
- Generate improvement suggestions with negligible latency
- Support batch processing for site-wide accessibility audits
- Memory usage suitable for running on standard business hardware
- Performance scaling linearly with document size

### Integration Points
- Standard content format import (HTML, Markdown, DOCX, PDF)
- Compatibility with WCAG accessibility guidelines
- Integration with screen reader simulation for testing
- Export capabilities for accessibility reports
- API design compatible with existing accessibility workflows

### Key Constraints
- Implementation using only Python standard library (no external NLP dependencies)
- Algorithms must accommodate various content domains and types
- Suggestions must preserve original meaning while improving accessibility
- Analysis must address needs of diverse disability types
- Processing must handle both structured and unstructured content

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- Screen reader optimization recommendations matching WCAG AAA requirements

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Content with unavoidably technical terminology (medical, legal, etc.)
- Text with intentionally creative or non-standard language use
- Documents with complex but necessary logical structures
- Content requiring domain expertise for full comprehension
- Materials with specialized notation or non-standard formatting
- Multilingual or code-switching content

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage for plain language conversion components
- 90% coverage for sentence structure simplification
- 95% coverage for cognitive load estimation algorithms
- 90% coverage for jargon and abbreviation detection
- 95% coverage for screen reader optimization tools

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
