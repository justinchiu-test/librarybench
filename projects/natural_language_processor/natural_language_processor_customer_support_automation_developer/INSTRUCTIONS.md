# Support Request Analysis Library

A natural language processing toolkit designed to automate analysis and classification of customer support requests.

## Overview

This project provides specialized text analysis capabilities for processing customer support messages, focusing on intent recognition, information extraction, sentiment analysis, response suggestion, and conversation flow tracking. It helps support teams efficiently categorize, prioritize, and respond to customer requests.

## Persona Description

Raj develops automation for customer service teams handling high volumes of support tickets. He needs to analyze incoming requests, categorize issues, and extract actionable information to improve response efficiency.

## Key Requirements

1. **Intent Classification**: Develop algorithms to determine the primary purpose of customer messages, categorizing them into issue types, question categories, and action requests. This feature is critical for Raj because accurately routing tickets to the right team or response template is the foundation of support automation, directly impacting resolution time and first-contact resolution rates.

2. **Information Extraction**: Create specialized entity recognition to identify product details, error codes, order numbers, account information, and customer action attempts from unstructured support messages. This capability allows Raj to automatically populate support ticket fields and provide agents with structured, relevant information without manual extraction from often lengthy customer messages.

3. **Sentiment Escalation**: Implement detection for emotionally charged language, urgency signals, and frustration indicators to identify messages needing priority attention. For Raj, automatically identifying highly negative or urgent communications enables proactive escalation to senior agents, preventing customer churn by addressing serious concerns before they intensify.

4. **Response Suggestion**: Build a framework for generating template-based replies for common scenarios based on detected intent, extracted information, and historical resolution patterns. This feature dramatically improves support efficiency by providing agents with contextually appropriate response templates that can be quickly personalized, reducing average handling time while maintaining quality.

5. **Conversation Flow Modeling**: Develop tracking for multi-message interactions, recognizing conversation stage, issue evolution, and progress toward resolution. This capability enables Raj to analyze support conversations as coherent journeys rather than isolated messages, providing insights into resolution paths and opportunities for conversation optimization.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Intent classification must be benchmarkable against human-labeled support tickets
- Information extraction must be validatable with known ticket data
- Sentiment analysis must correlate with customer satisfaction scores
- Response suggestions must be evaluable for appropriateness and effectiveness
- Conversation modeling must accurately track interaction states

### Performance Expectations
- Process standard support messages (50-500 words) in under 1 second
- Handle high-volume ticket streams (1000+ messages per hour)
- Support batch analysis for historical ticket review
- Memory-efficient implementation for production deployment
- Real-time processing capability for live support systems

### Integration Points
- Standard ticket format compatibility (JSON, CSV)
- Export capabilities for support analytics systems
- Structured output for ticket management systems
- Historical data analysis for continuous improvement
- Metrics alignment with standard support KPIs

### Key Constraints
- Implementation using only Python standard library (no external NLP dependencies)
- Processing optimized for customer support language and conventions
- Algorithms must handle informal, error-filled customer communications
- Features must adapt to evolving product terminology and issues
- System must maintain customer privacy and data security

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate classification of customer intents across support domains
- Precise extraction of technical and account information from unstructured text
- Reliable detection of negative sentiment requiring escalation
- Appropriate response suggestion based on intent and context
- Correct tracking of conversation state across multiple messages

### Critical User Scenarios
- Categorizing a batch of incoming support tickets by issue type
- Extracting product details and error information from technical support requests
- Identifying highly negative messages requiring immediate intervention
- Suggesting appropriate response templates for common customer questions
- Analyzing resolution paths for complex multi-message support conversations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Intent classification with 85%+ accuracy compared to human agents
- Information extraction achieving 90%+ precision for critical entities
- Sentiment escalation with 90%+ recall for genuinely urgent cases
- Response suggestion matching agent selection in 80%+ of common scenarios
- Conversation tracking with 85%+ accuracy across interaction lifecycles

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Messages with multiple or ambiguous intents
- Tickets with minimal or highly technical information
- Culturally specific expressions of frustration or urgency
- Novel or previously unseen issue types
- Messages with spelling errors or non-standard grammar
- Mixed-language support requests
- Sarcasm and other complex emotional expressions

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage for intent classification components
- 95% coverage for information extraction systems
- 90% coverage for sentiment analysis algorithms
- 85% coverage for response suggestion framework
- 90% coverage for conversation flow modeling

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

1. Customer intents are accurately classified into appropriate support categories
2. Relevant technical and account information is correctly extracted from messages
3. Emotionally charged or urgent tickets are reliably identified for priority handling
