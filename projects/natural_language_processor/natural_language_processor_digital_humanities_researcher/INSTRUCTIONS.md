# Literary Analysis NLP Toolkit

A specialized natural language processing library tailored for analyzing historical texts and literary works.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for digital humanities researchers to perform sophisticated textual analysis on historical and literary works. It focuses on authorship analysis, intertextual relationships, stylometric techniques, thematic evolution, and comparative textual analysis without requiring advanced programming skills.

## Persona Description

Dr. Park analyzes historical texts to identify authorship patterns, cultural trends, and linguistic evolution across centuries of literature. He needs accessible NLP tools that can be customized for specific literary analysis without requiring advanced programming or machine learning expertise.

## Key Requirements

1. **Historical Language Models**: Implement specialized language processing adapters for archaic word forms, historical spelling variations, and period-specific grammar patterns. This feature is critical for Dr. Park because it enables accurate processing of texts from different historical periods that would confound standard NLP tools calibrated for contemporary language.

2. **Intertextuality Detection**: Create algorithms to identify quotations, allusions, and textual borrowings between literary works across a corpus. This capability allows Dr. Park to trace the flow of ideas and expressions between texts and authors, revealing intellectual networks and influence patterns crucial for understanding literary evolution.

3. **Stylometric Analysis**: Develop comprehensive author signature detection using statistical analysis of writing patterns, distinctive vocabulary, syntactic structures, and other stylistic markers. This feature is essential for Dr. Park's authorship attribution studies and enables objective identification of stylistic fingerprints that may resolve disputed texts or detect collaborative authorship.

4. **Thematic Evolution Tracking**: Build mechanisms to identify, tag, and trace conceptual themes and motifs as they develop across texts, authors, and time periods. For Dr. Park, understanding how ideas transform and evolve throughout literary history is fundamental to his research on cultural trends and intellectual history.

5. **Canon Comparison Tools**: Implement specialized comparison algorithms to identify distinctive features, outliers, and commonalities among works within defined literary movements or canons. This allows Dr. Park to objectively characterize literary periods and movements, identifying what makes particular works either representative or revolutionary within their context.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All text processing functions must be deterministic for reproducible research results
- Historical language models must be testable against period-specific text samples
- Intertextuality detection must track evidence provenance for academic verification
- Stylometric analysis must produce consistent results with statistical confidence measures
- Theme tracking must work consistently across varied text formats and lengths

### Performance Expectations
- Ability to process full-length literary works (100,000+ words) in reasonable time
- Support for corpus-level analysis across hundreds of texts (10+ million words total)
- Efficient memory usage to handle large historical corpora on standard research hardware
- Timely results for interactive exploratory analysis (under 60 seconds for targeted queries)
- Statistical calculations optimized for large sample sizes and sparse feature matrices

### Integration Points
- Standardized text import formats (TXT, XML, TEI, etc.)
- Export capabilities compatible with academic publishing requirements
- Support for standard literary corpora file structures
- Statistical output compatible with academic citation standards
- Metadata integration from standard bibliographic formats

### Key Constraints
- Implementations must use only Python standard library (no external NLP dependencies)
- All algorithms must accommodate historical language variations and inconsistencies
- Processing must be robust to OCR errors and transcription inconsistencies
- Analysis must provide academic-grade evidence citation and methodology documentation
- Statistical methods must be explainable and justified with reference to humanities standards

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality required for this project includes:

1. **Historical Text Processing**
   - Period-specific tokenization with awareness of historical orthography
   - Spelling normalization across historical variants
   - Archaic grammar and syntax parsing
   - Period-adjusted frequency analysis and statistics

2. **Intertextual Analysis**
   - N-gram matching across literary corpus with customizable length
   - Semantic similarity detection beyond exact matches
   - Reference and allusion pattern recognition
   - Chronological dependency tracking and visualization

3. **Stylometric Analytics**
   - Multi-dimensional stylistic feature extraction
   - Statistical authorship attribution algorithms
   - Confidence scoring for stylistic claims
   - Collaborative authorship detection and segmentation

4. **Thematic Analysis**
   - Concept and theme identification algorithms
   - Temporal tracking of thematic developments
   - Contextual analysis of theme variations
   - Evolution mapping across literary periods

5. **Comparative Canon Analysis**
   - Genre and movement classification features
   - Distinctive markers extraction for literary periods
   - Outlier detection within defined canons
   - Cross-movement influence analysis

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate processing of historical language with period-specific adaptations
- Correct identification of shared textual elements between literary works
- Reliable stylometric analysis with demonstrable statistical validity
- Precise tracking of thematic elements across texts and time periods
- Valid comparative analysis of works within and across literary canons

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing authorship patterns in disputed historical texts
- Mapping intertextual relationships in a defined literary corpus
- Tracing thematic evolution across literary periods
- Identifying stylistic outliers within established literary movements
- Comparing linguistic features across multiple authors and periods

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete stylometric analysis of novel-length text in under 2 minutes
- Intertextual comparison across 100+ works in under 10 minutes
- Memory usage below 4GB for corpus of 1,000 average-length literary works
- Thematic tracking across chronological corpus in linear time complexity
- Statistical calculations completing with 95% confidence interval in reasonable time

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely archaic or unusual linguistic forms
- Multilingual or code-switching texts
- Heavily corrupted or partial historical manuscripts
- Stylistic anomalies and intentional style-switching
- Genre-crossing or period-transitional works
- Collaborative works with multiple authorial voices

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage across all processing components
- 95% coverage for historical language model adaptations
- 90% coverage for intertextuality detection algorithms
- 95% coverage for stylometric analysis functions
- 90% coverage for thematic tracking components
- 90% coverage for canon comparison utilities

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
