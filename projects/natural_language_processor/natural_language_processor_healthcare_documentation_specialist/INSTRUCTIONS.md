# Medical Text Analysis System

A specialized natural language processing library for analyzing and standardizing healthcare documentation and clinical notes.

## Overview

This project provides tools for medical terminology standardization, clinical abbreviation expansion, protocol compliance checking, information completeness verification, and adverse event detection. It helps healthcare documentation specialists ensure accurate, consistent, and complete medical records.

## Persona Description

Dr. Chen reviews medical records and clinical notes to ensure accurate documentation, consistent terminology, and proper information capture. She needs specialized text analysis focusing on medical terminology, abbreviations, and clinical protocols.

## Key Requirements

1. **Medical Terminology Standardization**: Develop comprehensive mapping systems to identify variant terms, misspellings, and non-standard expressions and convert them to preferred medical nomenclature. This feature is critical for Dr. Chen because terminological consistency ensures accurate communication between healthcare providers, proper coding for billing, and reliable data extraction for research and quality improvement.

2. **Clinical Abbreviation Expansion**: Create context-aware abbreviation detection and expansion with disambiguation capabilities for abbreviations with multiple possible meanings in different medical contexts. This capability allows Dr. Chen to ensure clarity in documentation where ambiguous abbreviations could lead to dangerous misinterpretations or treatment errors, while still permitting the efficient use of standard abbreviations.

3. **Protocol Compliance Checking**: Implement specialized pattern matching to verify documentation meets clinical guidelines, required elements for specific conditions, and institutional documentation standards. For Dr. Chen, automated compliance verification dramatically improves efficiency in regulatory compliance and quality assurance, ensuring proper documentation without manual review of extensive protocols.

4. **Information Completeness Verification**: Build detection systems for missing elements in clinical narratives, identifying gaps in documentation required for different visit types, procedures, or conditions. This feature helps Dr. Chen systematically identify documentation gaps that could affect quality measures, reimbursement, or continuity of care, rather than relying on memory of complex requirements.

5. **Adverse Event Detection**: Develop analysis capabilities to highlight potential safety incidents, complications, or adverse reactions that may require follow-up or reporting. This capability enables Dr. Chen to proactively identify patient safety issues that might be embedded within clinical narratives but not explicitly flagged, ensuring proper reporting and follow-up for quality and safety purposes.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Terminology standardization must be testable against medical dictionaries
- Abbreviation expansion must be verifiable with medical abbreviation databases
- Protocol compliance checking must validate against established clinical documentation standards
- Completeness verification must be measurable against specialty-specific requirements
- Adverse event detection must be benchmarked against known safety event cases

### Performance Expectations
- Process standard clinical notes (500-2000 words) in under 5 seconds
- Handle batch processing of patient record sets
- Support incremental analysis of documentation during creation
- Memory usage suitable for running on standard clinical workstations
- Response time appropriate for interactive documentation review

### Integration Points
- Support for standard healthcare documentation formats (HL7, FHIR)
- Compatibility with medical terminology systems (SNOMED CT, ICD-10, RxNorm)
- Export capabilities for documentation quality reporting
- Alignment with regulatory compliance frameworks
- Standardized output for quality improvement processes

### Key Constraints
- Implementation using only Python standard library (no external NLP dependencies)
- Algorithms must respect patient privacy and data security
- Processing must accommodate clinical specialty-specific language
- Analysis must adapt to institutional documentation variations
- Features must align with healthcare regulatory requirements

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- Adverse event detection with 85%+ sensitivity for documenting safety concerns

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Highly specialized or rare medical terminology
- Novel abbreviations or institution-specific acronyms
- Complex or atypical clinical cases
- Conflicting or overlapping documentation standards
- Ambiguous narratives requiring clinical judgment
- Specialty-specific documentation variations
- Emerging medical concepts not in standard terminologies

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for terminology standardization components
- 90% coverage for abbreviation expansion systems
- 95% coverage for protocol compliance checking
- 90% coverage for information completeness verification
- 90% coverage for adverse event detection algorithms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
