# Literary Analysis NLP Toolkit for Digital Humanities

## Overview
A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for digital humanities researchers to analyze historical texts, identify authorship patterns, track cultural trends, and study linguistic evolution across literary periods without requiring advanced programming expertise.

## Persona Description
Dr. Park analyzes historical texts to identify authorship patterns, cultural trends, and linguistic evolution across centuries of literature. He needs accessible NLP tools that can be customized for specific literary analysis without requiring advanced programming or machine learning expertise.

## Key Requirements
1. **Historical Language Models**: Implement adaptable language processing capabilities that can handle archaic word forms, historical spelling variations, and evolving grammar patterns across different time periods. This is essential for accurately analyzing texts from different historical eras without misinterpreting linguistic changes as meaningful content differences.

2. **Intertextuality Detection**: Create algorithms to identify quotations, allusions, and textual borrowings between literary works, enabling scholars to trace the network of influences and references across a corpus of texts. This capability is critical for understanding how ideas propagate through literary traditions and how authors engage with their predecessors.

3. **Stylometric Analysis**: Develop statistical methods to analyze and compare authorship signatures based on linguistic features such as vocabulary richness, sentence structure, function word usage, and other stylistic markers. This enables attribution studies, forgery detection, and collaborative authorship analysis essential to literary scholarship.

4. **Thematic Evolution Tracking**: Implement topic modeling and semantic analysis techniques to track how concepts, themes, and ideas develop throughout literary periods, showing shifts in meaning and emphasis over time. This allows researchers to quantitatively support observations about changing cultural values and intellectual trends.

5. **Canon Comparison Tools**: Create frameworks for identifying distinctive linguistic and thematic features of works within defined literary movements or canons, highlighting what makes certain texts representative or atypical. This helps scholars objectively evaluate which works exemplify period characteristics and which challenge conventional boundaries.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All analysis algorithms must produce consistent, deterministic results
  - Historical language models must be configurable for different time periods and testable against period-specific corpora
  - Statistical methods must include confidence measures and significance testing
  - Analysis results must be reproducible with the same inputs
  - Component functions should be independently testable

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Process book-length texts (300K+ words) within reasonable timeframes
  - Handle corpus-level analysis of 50+ full-length works
  - Support incremental analysis to accommodate large literary collections
  - Maintain reasonable memory usage even with extensive comparative analyses

- **Integration Points**:
  - Import/export capabilities for common textual formats (plain text, TEI XML, etc.)
  - Support for custom literary metadata (publication dates, author info, genre classifications)
  - Ability to save and load analysis states for long-running research projects
  - Export results in formats suitable for academic publication

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Design for accessibility to users with limited technical backgrounds
  - Accommodate the linguistic peculiarities of historical texts
  - Support for non-standard orthography and spelling variation
  - Maintain scholarly rigor in analytical methods

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. Text preprocessing specialized for historical documents:
   - Period-specific tokenization handling archaic forms
   - Normalization options for spelling variations
   - Recognition of historical abbreviations and contractions
   - Handling of period-specific punctuation and formatting

2. Comparative textual analysis tools:
   - N-gram similarity detection for intertextuality
   - Stylometric feature extraction and comparison
   - Distinctive vocabulary analysis between texts or corpora
   - Diachronic linguistic change tracking

3. Statistical analysis frameworks for:
   - Authorship attribution based on stylistic features
   - Genre and period classification
   - Anomaly detection for editorial interventions or textual corruptions
   - Significance testing for observed linguistic patterns

4. Thematic and conceptual analysis:
   - Co-occurrence patterns for semantic relationships
   - Topic extraction and tracking across texts
   - Semantic field identification and evolution
   - Contextual meaning analysis for period-specific terms

5. Scholarly output generation:
   - Evidence collection for supporting literary arguments
   - Quantitative substantiation of qualitative observations
   - Data formats suitable for academic publication
   - Reproduction of analysis for scholarly verification

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of historical language processing against period-specific test cases
  - Precision and recall of intertextuality detection with known references
  - Reliability of stylometric attribution against established scholarly consensus
  - Consistency of thematic tracking across different texts
  - Accuracy of canon comparison for established literary movements

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Analyzing linguistic changes across different editions of a text
  - Comparing writing styles between disputed and confirmed works by an author
  - Tracking the evolution of specific themes across literary periods
  - Identifying patterns of influence between canonical works
  - Discovering distinctive features of works within a literary movement

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Process complete novels (100K+ words) in under 5 minutes
  - Perform corpus-level analysis of 20+ works within reasonable research timeframes
  - Execute stylometric comparisons with at least 30 measured features
  - Maintain consistent performance when scaling to larger text collections

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of multilingual texts or code-switching common in historical works
  - Processing texts with significant OCR errors or transcription issues
  - Analyzing fragmentary texts or works with uncertain attribution
  - Managing texts with unusual formatting or structural elements
  - Graceful handling of extremely archaic language variants

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90%+ coverage of all analytical algorithms
  - Comprehensive testing of historical language processing
  - Validation against scholarly consensus on test cases
  - Verification of statistical significance measures
  - Tests for all supported historical periods and language variants

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It can accurately process texts from different historical periods while accounting for linguistic evolution
2. Intertextuality detection identifies known quotations and allusions with high precision and recall
3. Stylometric analysis produces authorship attributions that align with scholarly consensus on test cases
4. Thematic tracking reveals patterns that correspond with established literary history
5. Canon comparison tools quantitatively identify features that match qualitative scholarly descriptions
6. Analysis results provide statistically significant evidence suitable for academic publication
7. The system accommodates the full range of scholarly use cases without requiring programming expertise
8. Performance remains reasonable when working with research-scale text collections
9. All functionality maintains scholarly standards for precision, accuracy, and methodological rigor
