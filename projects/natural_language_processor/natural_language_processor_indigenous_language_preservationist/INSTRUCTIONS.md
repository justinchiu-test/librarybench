# Indigenous Language Processing Framework

A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for documenting and analyzing endangered languages with limited data resources.

## Overview

This project provides tools for processing languages with small corpora, customizable grammar rules, morphological analysis, oral transcription optimization, and cultural context preservation. It enables language preservationists to document, analyze, and maintain endangered languages with unique linguistic structures.

## Persona Description

Dr. Thompson works with indigenous communities to document and preserve endangered languages with limited written records. He needs adaptable language processing tools that can be customized for languages with unique structures and limited training data.

## Key Requirements

1. **Small Corpus Optimization**: Develop processing algorithms specifically designed to work effectively with extremely limited language samples, including statistics for low-resource settings and data augmentation techniques. This feature is critical for Dr. Thompson because endangered indigenous languages often have very few documented examples, yet still require robust analysis capabilities that can operate reliably without the massive datasets typical NLP systems require.

2. **Grammar Rule Customization Framework**: Create a flexible system for modeling non-Indo-European language structures, including ergative-absolutive patterns, complex morphology, evidentiality marking, and other typologically diverse features. This capability allows Dr. Thompson to accurately represent the unique grammatical structures of indigenous languages that often differ significantly from well-studied European languages that most NLP tools are designed for.

3. **Morphological Analyzer for Agglutinative Languages**: Build specialized morphological processing for highly agglutinative or polysynthetic languages where words contain multiple morphemes expressing complex grammatical relationships. For Dr. Thompson, this is essential because many indigenous languages create word-sentences with intricate internal structures that cannot be properly analyzed by standard tokenization and parsing approaches.

4. **Oral Transcription Tools**: Implement specialized processing optimized for converting spoken recordings to analyzed text, with features for handling dialectal variation, code-switching, and partial utterances common in field recordings. This feature helps Dr. Thompson efficiently document languages that may have primarily oral traditions with few or no written records, bridging spoken documentation to computational analysis.

5. **Cultural Context Preservation**: Develop semantic frameworks that link linguistic elements to traditional knowledge systems, ensuring cultural meanings and contextual uses are preserved alongside literal translations. This capability enables Dr. Thompson to document not just the language itself but its cultural significance and usage contexts, critical for true language preservation that extends beyond purely linguistic documentation.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All algorithms must function with extremely small training datasets
- Grammar rule systems must be verifiable against linguistic fieldwork notes
- Morphological analysis must be testable with manually segmented gold standards
- Transcription tools must be evaluable with speaker-verified transcriptions
- Cultural context linkage must maintain provenance for verification

### Performance Expectations
- Process language samples with as few as 500-1000 sentences total
- Generate useful analysis even with incomplete paradigms
- Support incremental refinement as new language data becomes available
- Memory efficient to run on field research equipment
- Processing speed suitable for interactive field research sessions

### Integration Points
- Field linguistics data formats (ELAN, FLEx, Toolbox)
- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) compatibility
- Export capabilities for linguistic documentation standards
- Integration with audio recording timestamp formats
- Support for lexicographic data structures

### Key Constraints
- Implementation using only Python standard library (no external NLP dependencies)
- Features must be adaptable to radically different linguistic structures
- Processing must accommodate incomplete language documentation
- Algorithms must respect cultural protocols around language usage
- System must be usable by linguistic fieldworkers without programming expertise

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Languages with extremely limited documentation
- Highly complex morphological systems
- Non-concatenative morphology

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
