# Indigenous Language Preservation Toolkit

## Overview
A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for documenting and preserving endangered indigenous languages with limited written records, focusing on small corpus optimization, customizable grammar rules, morphological analysis, oral transcription processing, and cultural context preservation.

## Persona Description
Dr. Thompson works with indigenous communities to document and preserve endangered languages with limited written records. He needs adaptable language processing tools that can be customized for languages with unique structures and limited training data.

## Key Requirements
1. **Small Corpus Optimization**: Develop algorithms specifically designed to extract maximum linguistic value from limited language examples, using statistical techniques adapted for sparse data and uncertainty. This is essential because endangered languages often have few documented examples, making traditional corpus linguistics approaches ineffective without specialized optimization.

2. **Grammar Rule Customization Framework**: Create a flexible, declarative system for modeling non-Indo-European language structures, including polysynthetic morphology, non-configurational syntax, evidentiality systems, and other typologically diverse features. This allows accurate analysis of indigenous languages that often have grammatical structures fundamentally different from majority languages.

3. **Morphological Analyzer for Agglutinative Languages**: Implement specialized morphological parsing for highly agglutinative or polysynthetic languages where words may contain multiple morphemes encoding complex grammatical relationships. This capability is crucial because many indigenous languages build words from numerous affixes in ways that require specialized decomposition approaches.

4. **Oral Transcription Tools**: Develop text processing optimized for converting spoken recordings to analyzed text, handling features like non-standardized orthography, code-switching, speech disfluencies, and dialectal variations. This addresses the primarily oral nature of many endangered languages that lack standardized writing systems or have multiple competing orthographies.

5. **Cultural Context Preservation**: Create frameworks for linking linguistic elements to traditional knowledge systems, cultural practices, and semantic domains that may not exist in majority languages. This maintains critical cultural metadata that gives words their full meaning within indigenous knowledge systems and worldviews.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All algorithms must function with minimal training data
  - Grammar customization must be verifiable against linguistic descriptions
  - Morphological analysis must validate against hand-annotated examples
  - Transcription tools must produce consistent, reproducible output
  - Cultural context mapping must be validatable by community experts

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Function effectively with corpora as small as a few thousand words
  - Support incremental improvement as new language data is collected
  - Process field recordings with reasonable efficiency
  - Handle real-time analysis during language documentation sessions
  - Scale gracefully as language documentation grows

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for linguistic annotation standards (ELAN, FLEx, etc.)
  - Import/export capabilities for common documentation formats
  - Integration with IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)
  - Support for non-standard orthographies and writing systems
  - Extensibility for language-specific analytical needs

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Design for linguistic diversity rather than majority language assumptions
  - Prioritize accuracy and customizability over processing speed
  - Support collaborative work between linguists and community members
  - Maintain respectful handling of culturally sensitive material

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. Small corpus linguistics frameworks:
   - Statistical techniques adapted for sparse data
   - Uncertainty quantification for limited examples
   - Pattern extraction from minimal training sets
   - Bootstrapping methods for corpus expansion
   - Cross-linguistic pattern inference where appropriate

2. Typologically flexible language modeling:
   - Customizable grammar rule systems
   - Non-configurational syntax handling
   - Morphosyntactic alignment options
   - Evidentiality and other specialized grammatical systems
   - Tone and non-linear phonological representation

3. Advanced morphological processing:
   - Morpheme boundary detection for agglutinative words
   - Allomorph recognition and normalization
   - Paradigm induction from limited examples
   - Interlinear glossing generation
   - Morphological pattern discovery

4. Oral language documentation support:
   - Transcription standardization tools
   - Speech disfluency handling
   - Code-switching detection and analysis
   - Dialect variation mapping
   - Orthography conversion and standardization

5. Cultural knowledge integration:
   - Semantic domain mapping
   - Cultural practice tagging
   - Traditional knowledge linkage
   - Conceptual schema representation
   - Ethnolinguistic annotation frameworks

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Effectiveness of algorithms with minimal training data
  - Accuracy of grammar rule customization for diverse languages
  - Precision of morphological analysis for complex word forms
  - Quality of transcription processing for oral recordings
  - Completeness of cultural context preservation

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Documenting a language with fewer than 5,000 recorded words
  - Customizing analysis for a language with unique grammatical features
  - Processing complex polysynthetic verbs into constituent morphemes
  - Converting field recordings into analyzable language data
  - Maintaining connections between words and cultural knowledge systems

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Extract meaningful patterns from corpora of 1,000-5,000 words
  - Correctly analyze morphologically complex words with 90%+ accuracy
  - Process and analyze field recording transcripts efficiently
  - Generate useful linguistic insights with minimal training data
  - Support documentation of a language's core grammatical features

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling extremely limited data (fewer than 1,000 words)
  - Processing languages with rare typological features
  - Managing competing orthographies or writing standards
  - Accommodating code-switching with majority languages
  - Dealing with dialectal variations within endangered languages

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90%+ coverage of all analysis algorithms
  - Comprehensive testing with diverse language typologies
  - Validation with actual endangered language data
  - Verification of cultural context preservation methods
  - Testing against linguistic field standards

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It effectively extracts linguistic patterns from very limited language data
2. Grammar customization successfully models diverse, non-Indo-European language structures
3. Morphological analysis correctly decomposes complex words in agglutinative languages
4. Oral transcription tools produce consistent, analyzable text from field recordings
5. Cultural context is preserved with appropriate linkages to linguistic elements
6. The system functions effectively with the minimal data typical of endangered language documentation
7. Analysis results meet linguistic field standards for language documentation
8. The toolkit supports the full documentation cycle from field recordings to analyzed language data
9. Community members can validate and contribute to the language documentation process
10. The implementation respects the cultural ownership and sensitivity of indigenous language materials

## Development Environment
To set up the development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
