# Indigenous Language Preservation Framework

A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for documenting and analyzing endangered languages with limited textual resources, adaptable to non-Indo-European linguistic structures and oral traditions.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for processing, analyzing, and documenting endangered indigenous languages with limited written records. The toolkit is designed to work effectively with small corpora, handle unique grammatical structures, support morphological analysis of agglutinative and polysynthetic languages, process oral recordings, and preserve cultural context alongside linguistic data.

## Persona Description

Dr. Thompson works with indigenous communities to document and preserve endangered languages with limited written records. He needs adaptable language processing tools that can be customized for languages with unique structures and limited training data.

## Key Requirements

1. **Small Corpus Optimization Engine**: Develop algorithms specifically designed to extract maximum linguistic insights from very limited language samples, overcoming the data scarcity common in endangered language documentation.
   - This feature is critical for Dr. Thompson as endangered languages often have minimal written documentation, making traditional NLP approaches that require large training datasets ineffective.
   - The system must derive meaningful patterns and rules from as few as 5-10 hours of transcribed speech or 50-100 pages of text, detecting structural regularities with statistical validity despite limited examples.

2. **Customizable Grammar Framework**: Create an adaptable system for modeling non-Indo-European language structures that can handle grammatical features uncommon in major world languages.
   - This capability is essential because indigenous languages often employ grammatical structures (like evidentiality markers, complex classifier systems, or non-linear syntax) that don't map well to frameworks designed for major world languages.
   - The framework must allow easy configuration to represent unique grammatical categories, relationship types, and structural patterns without forcing Western linguistic assumptions.

3. **Morphological Analysis System**: Implement specialized tools for analyzing highly agglutinative or polysynthetic languages where individual words can contain multiple morphemes equivalent to entire sentences in English.
   - This feature allows Dr. Thompson to work effectively with languages that build complex words through extensive affixation or incorporation, where standard word tokenization approaches would fail.
   - The system must detect morpheme boundaries, identify grammatical and semantic components within complex words, and recognize patterns of word formation specific to the language.

4. **Oral Transcription Processor**: Develop optimized tools for converting spoken language recordings to analyzed text, handling features specific to oral traditions such as prosody, repetition patterns, and performance variations.
   - This capability is vital as many endangered languages have stronger oral than written traditions, with important linguistic features expressed through speech patterns that must be preserved in documentation.
   - The processor must align transcriptions with recordings, capture para-linguistic features, and support integration of multiple speaker variations.

5. **Cultural Context Preservation System**: Build a framework for linking linguistic elements to cultural knowledge systems, ensuring language documentation preserves the cultural context essential for full understanding.
   - This feature is crucial because language and culture are deeply interconnected, with many terms and expressions meaningless without their cultural context, especially in indigenous knowledge systems.
   - The system must support annotation of cultural significance, track semantic domains related to traditional practices, and maintain relationships between linguistic elements and cultural knowledge.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All analysis algorithms must produce consistent, reproducible results with the same input data
- Grammar customization must be verifiable against expert linguistic descriptions
- Morphological analysis must achieve measurable precision and recall despite limited training examples
- Oral transcription processing must be evaluable against human expert transcriptions
- Cultural annotation linkages must be systematically verifiable for completeness and accuracy

### Performance Expectations
- Extract meaningful linguistic patterns from as few as 1,000 word tokens
- Process and analyze up to 10 hours of transcribed speech in under 30 minutes
- Support incremental model refinement as new language data becomes available
- Complete morphological analysis of complex words in near real-time (< 1 second per word)
- Handle batch processing of entire available corpora for comprehensive analysis

### Integration Points
- Accept various data formats including audio recordings, transcriptions, and existing lexical resources
- Support integration with linguistic annotation standards (ELAN, FLEx, etc.)
- Enable import/export to archival formats for language documentation
- Provide APIs for community language applications and educational tools
- Allow integration of multimedia cultural context materials (images, videos, audio)

### Key Constraints
- Implementation must use only Python standard library
- System must function effectively without requiring internet connectivity for fieldwork situations
- Processing must be adaptable to languages with radically different structures from major world languages
- Analysis must respect cultural protocols regarding language use and documentation
- All components must be configurable without requiring programming expertise
- Memory and processing requirements must be manageable on standard laptop hardware

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Small Data Language Analyzer**: A framework optimized for extracting patterns from limited samples. It should:
   - Identify recurring linguistic patterns despite minimal examples
   - Apply statistical techniques adapted for small datasets
   - Generate provisional grammar rules based on limited evidence
   - Support incremental refinement as more data becomes available
   - Identify potential linguistic gaps requiring additional documentation

2. **Flexible Grammar Modeling System**: An adaptable framework for representing diverse language structures. It should:
   - Support configuration of arbitrary grammatical categories and relations
   - Model non-linear syntactic structures and dependencies
   - Represent grammatical features uncommon in major languages
   - Allow definition of language-specific rule systems
   - Enable comparison between variant dialect forms

3. **Morphological Decomposition Engine**: A specialized system for complex word analysis. It should:
   - Identify morpheme boundaries in agglutinative or polysynthetic words
   - Recognize affixation patterns and morphophonemic changes
   - Analyze incorporation structures and compositional meaning
   - Track productive vs. lexicalized word formation processes
   - Generate morphological rules based on observed patterns

4. **Oral Language Processing Framework**: Tools optimized for speech-based language documentation. It should:
   - Align transcriptions with audio recordings at multiple levels
   - Capture prosodic features relevant to meaning
   - Process repetition patterns and performance variations
   - Support multiple speaker variation analysis
   - Handle code-switching and language mixing

5. **Cultural Knowledge Integration System**: A framework linking language to cultural context. It should:
   - Connect linguistic elements to traditional knowledge domains
   - Track semantic fields related to cultural practices
   - Support culturally appropriate annotation systems
   - Preserve metaphorical and symbolic associations
   - Maintain relationships between expressions and cultural contexts
