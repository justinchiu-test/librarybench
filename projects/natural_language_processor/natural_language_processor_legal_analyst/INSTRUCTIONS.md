# Legal Document Analysis System

## Overview
A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for legal professionals to analyze contracts, legal briefs, and regulatory documents, focusing on entity extraction, obligation detection, reference linking, inconsistency identification, and regulatory compliance verification.

## Persona Description
Aisha reviews contracts, legal briefs, and regulatory documents to identify inconsistencies, obligations, and potential compliance issues. She needs specialized text analysis focusing on legal terminology, commitments, and conditional statements.

## Key Requirements
1. **Legal Entity Extraction**: Develop algorithms to identify and categorize legal entities within documents, including parties, jurisdictions, regulated items, dates, monetary values, and defined terms. This enables rapid comprehension of document scope and applicability, which is foundational for all subsequent legal analysis.

2. **Obligation Detection**: Implement pattern recognition to highlight commitments, requirements, deadlines, and performance obligations throughout legal documents, distinguishing between mandatory, permissive, and prohibitive language. This allows lawyers to quickly identify all actions required of each party, reducing the risk of overlooked responsibilities.

3. **Definitional Reference Linking**: Create a system to connect defined terms to their formal definitions within documents and across related document sets, establishing a hierarchical map of terminology usage and definition inheritance. This clarifies the precise meaning of terms throughout complex legal documents, preventing misinterpretation due to context-specific definitions.

4. **Inconsistency Identification**: Develop algorithms to detect contradictory statements, ambiguous clauses, and logical conflicts within and across legal documents, highlighting potential drafting errors or negotiation issues. This helps identify problematic language that could lead to disputes or unintended legal consequences.

5. **Regulatory Citation Matching**: Implement recognition patterns to connect document text with specific laws, regulations, and legal standards, verifying compliance requirements and identifying potentially non-compliant provisions. This streamlines regulatory review by automatically flagging sections referencing external legal requirements and standards.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All analysis algorithms must produce consistent, deterministic results
  - Entity extraction must be testable against gold-standard legal corpora
  - Obligation detection must identify known commitments with high precision
  - Definition linking must establish verifiable cross-references
  - Inconsistency identification must be validated against known conflicts

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Process lengthy contracts (100+ pages) in reasonable timeframes
  - Handle large regulatory documents with complex structures
  - Support batch processing of related document sets (master agreements, amendments)
  - Maintain lookup speed for cross-referenced definitions
  - Scale to handle document repositories for comprehensive compliance review

- **Integration Points**:
  - Import capabilities for standard legal document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
  - Support for legal citation formats and jurisdiction-specific conventions
  - Export of analysis results in structured formats
  - Reference resolution across document collections
  - Version comparison for contract revisions and amendments

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Maintain high precision to meet legal standards of accuracy
  - Handle jurisdiction-specific legal terminology and conventions
  - Support for formal legal document structures and formatting
  - Manage document confidentiality appropriately

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. Specialized legal text preprocessing:
   - Document structure recognition (sections, clauses, exhibits)
   - Legal citation parsing and normalization
   - Handling of document hierarchies and cross-references
   - Jurisdiction-specific formatting and conventions
   - Legal boilerplate identification

2. Entity extraction frameworks for:
   - Party identification with role assignment
   - Jurisdiction and governing law recognition
   - Temporal expressions and deadline extraction
   - Monetary values and payment terms
   - Product, service, and regulated item identification

3. Obligation analysis capabilities:
   - Deontic language classification (shall, must, may, etc.)
   - Conditional obligation recognition
   - Deadline and timeline extraction
   - Performance requirement identification
   - Obligation assignment to specific parties

4. Definition and reference management:
   - Term definition extraction and cataloging
   - Reference resolution within and across documents
   - Definition hierarchy and inheritance tracking
   - Definitional scope determination
   - Term usage consistency verification

5. Logical and compliance analysis:
   - Contradiction and inconsistency detection
   - Ambiguity identification and classification
   - Regulatory requirement mapping
   - Compliance verification against cited standards
   - Risk factor identification and classification

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of legal entity extraction across document types
  - Precision and recall of obligation detection in complex clauses
  - Completeness of definition reference linking
  - Reliability of inconsistency identification in ambiguous text
  - Accuracy of regulatory citation matching

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Analyzing lengthy contracts for all party obligations
  - Reviewing document amendments against original agreements
  - Checking regulatory compliance of industry-specific documents
  - Identifying definitional inconsistencies across document sets
  - Extracting key contract provisions for due diligence

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Process standard contracts (50 pages) in under 2 minutes
  - Complete full citation analysis of regulatory filings in under 5 minutes
  - Compare document revisions with highlighted changes rapidly
  - Maintain reasonable memory usage with large document collections
  - Support incremental analysis for live document editing

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling poorly structured or non-standard legal documents
  - Processing scanned documents with OCR errors
  - Managing documents with complex nested definitions
  - Analyzing documents with jurisdiction-specific terminology
  - Graceful handling of ambiguous legal language

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 95%+ coverage of all analysis algorithms
  - Comprehensive testing of entity extraction patterns
  - Validation against diverse legal document types
  - Testing across multiple legal domains (contracts, regulations, briefs)
  - Verification with documents containing known issues and edge cases

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Legal entities are accurately identified and categorized with precision comparable to expert review
2. Obligations are detected with high recall, capturing at least 95% of explicit commitments
3. Definitional references are correctly linked throughout documents with clear scope boundaries
4. Logical inconsistencies are identified with minimal false positives
5. Regulatory citations are properly connected to relevant external sources
6. The system processes standard legal documents with acceptable performance
7. Analysis results provide actionable insights for legal review
8. The toolkit significantly reduces manual review time for common legal documents
9. Results maintain the high accuracy standards required for legal work
10. The system adapts to different legal domains and document types

## Development Environment
To set up the development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
