# Legal Document Analysis Framework

A specialized natural language processing library for analyzing contracts, legal briefs, and regulatory documents.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for legal document analysis, focusing on entity extraction, obligation detection, definitional reference linking, inconsistency identification, and regulatory citation mapping. It helps legal professionals systematically identify key components, commitments, and potential issues in legal documents.

## Persona Description

Aisha reviews contracts, legal briefs, and regulatory documents to identify inconsistencies, obligations, and potential compliance issues. She needs specialized text analysis focusing on legal terminology, commitments, and conditional statements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Legal Entity Extraction**: Develop comprehensive identification of named entities specific to legal contexts, including parties, jurisdictions, regulated items, dates, monetary values, and legal roles. This feature is critical for Aisha because accurate identification of who is legally bound to what forms the foundation of contract analysis and helps her rapidly establish the key parties and subjects in complex legal documents.

2. **Obligation Detection**: Create specialized pattern recognition for commitments, requirements, permissions, prohibitions, and deadlines expressed in legal language. This capability allows Aisha to systematically audit contractual obligations and compliance requirements, ensuring that no actionable commitments are overlooked when reviewing lengthy and complex agreements.

3. **Definitional Reference Linking**: Implement a system to connect defined terms to their formal definitions within documents and track their consistent usage throughout the text. For Aisha, understanding precisely how terms are defined and whether they're used consistently is essential for identifying ambiguities that could create legal vulnerabilities or interpretation disputes.

4. **Inconsistency Identification**: Build algorithms to detect contradictory statements, ambiguous clauses, and logical conflicts within legal documents. This feature helps Aisha identify potential contract weaknesses, drafting errors, or deliberate ambiguities that could lead to disputes or compliance problems, significantly reducing legal risk for her organization.

5. **Regulatory Citation Matching**: Develop pattern matching for legal citations and references to connect document text with specific laws, regulations, and legal standards. This capability enables Aisha to efficiently verify compliance with relevant legal frameworks and understand how cited regulations affect contractual obligations, a task that would otherwise require extensive manual cross-referencing.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All extraction patterns must be tested against legal corpus with known entities
- Obligation detection must be validated with established legal test cases
- Definition linkage must be verified for complex document structures
- Inconsistency detection must identify known contradictions in test documents
- Citation matching must be validated against standard legal citation formats

### Performance Expectations
- Process standard contracts (50-100 pages) in under 60 seconds
- Handle large regulatory documents (500+ pages) in under 5 minutes
- Support batch processing of document collections
- Memory usage optimized for standard legal workstation hardware
- Response time suitable for interactive document review workflows

### Integration Points
- Support for standard legal document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Export capabilities to structured formats for further analysis
- Citation linking to common legal reference systems
- Entity annotation compatible with legal documentation standards
- Results formatted for inclusion in legal review reports

### Key Constraints
- Implementation using only Python standard library (no external NLP dependencies)
- Processing optimized for formal legal language and structure
- Patterns and rules must accommodate variations in legal drafting styles
- Analysis must handle complex nested clauses and legal document organization
- Features must adapt to different jurisdictions and legal domains

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality required for this project includes:

1. **Legal Text Processing Engine**
   - Specialized tokenization for legal documents
   - Legal sentence boundary detection
   - Section and clause segmentation
   - Hierarchical document structure parsing
   - Legal formatting normalization

2. **Legal Entity Recognition System**
   - Party and actor identification
   - Jurisdiction and venue extraction
   - Temporal expression resolution
   - Monetary and quantitative term extraction
   - Role and capacity detection

3. **Obligation Analysis Framework**
   - Deontic language identification (shall, must, may, etc.)
   - Conditional obligation extraction
   - Temporal constraint recognition
   - Performance requirement classification
   - Obligation party assignment

4. **Definitional Analysis System**
   - Definition clause extraction
   - Defined term tracking throughout documents
   - Usage consistency verification
   - Definition network mapping
   - Term scope analysis

5. **Compliance and Consistency Framework**
   - Contradiction detection algorithms
   - Ambiguity identification
   - Citation validation and resolution
   - Regulatory requirement mapping
   - Cross-reference verification

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate identification of legal entities across different document types
- Correct detection of obligations with their conditions and constraints
- Precise linking of defined terms to their definitions
- Reliable identification of inconsistencies and contradictions
- Accurate matching of regulatory citations to reference systems

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing a complex contract to extract all obligations and commitments
- Identifying potential contradictions in a lengthy regulatory document
- Mapping defined terms throughout a multi-section agreement
- Extracting and categorizing all legal entities in a corporate transaction
- Validating regulatory citations in a compliance document

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process a 50-page contract in under 30 seconds
- Extract entities with precision and recall exceeding 85%
- Identify obligations with accuracy above 80%
- Detect known inconsistencies with 75%+ success rate
- Complete full document analysis within timelines suitable for legal review cycles

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of unusually formatted legal documents
- Processing of documents with complex nested definitions
- Analysis of contracts with intentionally ambiguous language
- Management of documents with extensive cross-references
- Processing of specialized legal domains with unique terminology
- Handling of multi-jurisdictional documents with varying conventions

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage for entity extraction components
- 90% coverage for obligation detection systems
- 95% coverage for definitional reference tracking
- 85% coverage for inconsistency identification algorithms
- 90% coverage for citation matching functions

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Legal entities are accurately extracted with categorization by type and role
2. Obligations and commitments are systematically identified with their associated conditions
3. Defined terms are correctly linked to their definitions with usage consistency analysis
4. Potential contradictions and inconsistencies are identified with supporting evidence
5. Regulatory citations are properly detected and resolved to reference systems
6. Processing performance meets the specified benchmarks for document size and complexity
7. Analysis results achieve accuracy levels comparable to junior legal review
8. The system handles various legal document types and structures appropriately
9. Edge cases in legal language are managed with reasonable accuracy
10. The toolkit demonstrably reduces time required for comprehensive legal document review
