# PyText for Computational Linguistics Students

## Overview
A pure Python natural language processing toolkit designed specifically for computational linguistics students to understand and visualize NLP algorithms by implementing them from scratch, with a focus on educational insight rather than production efficiency.

## Persona Description
Maya is a graduate student studying computational linguistics who wants to understand NLP algorithms by implementing them from scratch rather than using black-box libraries. Her primary goal is to gain deep intuition about how language processing techniques work while building a portfolio project for future job applications.

## Key Requirements
1. **Algorithm Visualization Tools**: Implement step-by-step visualization of text processing through NLP pipelines, allowing students to see how tokens transform, parse trees develop, and classifications emerge. This feature is critical for developing intuition about how algorithms process language data.

2. **Comparative Analysis Framework**: Create a systematic way to test different approaches to the same NLP task (e.g., different stemming algorithms or sentiment analysis techniques) and compare their outputs, accuracy, and performance. This enables understanding of algorithm trade-offs and suitability for different linguistic contexts.

3. **Academic Paper Implementation Templates**: Develop a structure for implementing algorithms described in academic papers, connecting theoretical descriptions to working code. This bridges the gap between research literature and practical implementation, developing crucial skills for research reproduction.

4. **Performance Profiling Tools**: Build instrumentation for measuring algorithm efficiency, memory usage, and scaling characteristics with different text inputs. This helps develop understanding of computational complexity in language processing algorithms.

5. **Linguistic Theory Annotations**: Create a system that connects code implementations to formal linguistic concepts, annotating how different components relate to theories of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. This reinforces connections between computer science implementation and linguistic theory.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All algorithms must support step-by-step execution with observable intermediate states
  - Implementations must be modular to allow testing of individual components
  - Each algorithm should have documented inputs, outputs, and expected behaviors
  - Processing pipeline components must be independently testable

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Focus on clarity and observability rather than processing speed
  - Should handle corpus sizes appropriate for educational examples (books, articles)
  - Visualization and analysis should remain responsive for texts up to 100KB
  - Algorithm complexity should be documented and measurable

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for loading and saving processed text states at any pipeline stage
  - Export capabilities for visualization data to standard formats
  - Clear API for extending with new algorithms or comparative implementations
  - Support for custom evaluation metrics

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Prioritize understandability of implementation over optimization
  - All algorithms must be transparent with no black-box components
  - Implementation should follow published academic descriptions where applicable

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. A flexible pipeline architecture for text processing that exposes intermediate states
2. Core NLP algorithms implemented from scratch with educational clarity:
   - Tokenization with multiple strategies
   - Part-of-speech tagging (rule-based approach)
   - Stemming and lemmatization algorithms
   - Basic parsing for syntactic structure
   - Statistical text analysis (TF-IDF, n-grams)
   - Simple sentiment analysis

3. Algorithm visualization capabilities that can:
   - Record and display step-by-step transformations
   - Visualize data structures (trees, graphs) as text representations
   - Show comparative outputs between different approaches

4. Performance measurement framework that can:
   - Count operations per algorithm
   - Time execution at different stages
   - Track memory usage
   - Scale with different input sizes

5. Integration of linguistic theory through:
   - Annotated code with theoretical foundations
   - Connections between code structures and linguistic concepts
   - Documentation linking implementation to academic literature

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of each NLP algorithm against reference examples
  - Correct implementation of published algorithms
  - Consistency of intermediate pipeline states
  - Proper visualization of algorithm steps
  - Accurate performance measurements

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Processing texts of varying complexity and linguistic features
  - Comparing multiple algorithm implementations for the same task
  - Tracking algorithm performance with different input characteristics
  - Visualizing the transformation of text through complete processing pipelines
  - Relating code implementations to formal linguistic concepts

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Should process educational-sized texts (10-100KB) in reasonable time
  - Step-by-step visualization should document all meaningful state changes
  - Comparison framework should highlight statistically significant differences
  - Memory usage should be bounded for typical educational examples

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of multilingual texts and special characters
  - Graceful processing of malformed or unexpected inputs
  - Proper error messages explaining algorithm failures
  - Boundary conditions in statistical methods

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 100% coverage of core algorithm implementations
  - 90%+ coverage of visualization and comparison frameworks
  - Tests for each linguistic theory integration point
  - Comprehensive validation of pipeline stage interactions

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Students can trace the execution of NLP algorithms step by step with clear visibility into internal states
2. Different approaches to the same NLP task can be systematically compared with quantitative results
3. Implementations accurately reflect algorithms as described in academic literature
4. Performance characteristics can be measured and analyzed for different algorithm choices
5. Code structure explicitly connects to linguistic theory through annotations and documentation
6. All algorithms function correctly on educational-scale examples with proper handling of edge cases
7. The library can be used as an effective educational tool for understanding NLP fundamentals
8. The codebase demonstrates software engineering best practices appropriate for a portfolio project

## Development Environment
To set up the development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
