# Social Media Text Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for social media analysts to monitor brand mentions, analyze customer sentiment, detect emerging trends, and track language patterns across various social platforms, with particular focus on informal content and evolving slang.

## Persona Description
Sophia monitors brand mentions and customer sentiment across social platforms for a marketing agency. She needs lightweight text analysis tools that can process large volumes of informal social media content with specialized language patterns and evolving slang.

## Key Requirements
1. **Emoji and Emoticon Semantic Integration**: Develop algorithms that incorporate non-textual sentiment indicators (emojis, emoticons, and special characters) into text analysis, treating them as meaningful semantic components rather than noise. This is essential for accurate sentiment analysis of social media content where these symbols often carry significant emotional weight that pure text analysis would miss.

2. **Trend Detection**: Implement statistical methods to identify emerging topics, hashtags, and viral language patterns in social media content, highlighting unusual spikes in frequency or novel term combinations. This capability allows analysts to spot emerging conversations around brands in real-time, giving marketing teams the ability to respond quickly to developing situations.

3. **Brand Sentiment Visualization**: Create analytical frameworks that map emotional associations with specific products or brand mentions, showing sentiment distribution and intensity across different audience segments and platforms. This provides marketing teams with nuanced understanding of brand perception beyond simple positive/negative classifications.

4. **Demographic Language Variation Analysis**: Develop techniques to identify how different user groups (age demographics, geographical regions, interest communities) discuss products or brands using distinct vocabulary, slang, and communication styles. This helps companies tailor marketing messages to specific audience segments using authentic, resonant language.

5. **Competitor Comparison Framework**: Implement methods for analyzing messaging differences between similar brands, highlighting distinctive language patterns, sentiment differences, and topic focus variations. This competitive intelligence is crucial for positioning strategy and identifying communication gaps or opportunities in the market.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All analysis algorithms must produce consistent results with deterministic behavior
  - Sentiment analysis must be testable against human-labeled validation sets
  - Trend detection algorithms should be verifiable with historical data
  - Language variation analysis should be validated against known demographic patterns
  - Rate limiting capabilities to prevent API throttling during testing

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Process thousands of short-form social posts (tweets, comments) per minute
  - Handle streaming analysis for real-time trend detection
  - Support batch processing of historical data sets (millions of posts)
  - Generate analysis results with minimal latency for time-sensitive applications
  - Maintain performance with constantly growing lexicons for evolving language

- **Integration Points**:
  - Clean data import from common social media formats
  - Export capabilities for analysis results in standard formats
  - Modular design for updating trend detection and slang recognition
  - Extensible framework for adding new emoji/emoticon semantic mappings

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Handle short-form, informal text with non-standard grammar and spelling
  - Adapt to rapidly evolving language patterns and new slang
  - Process multilingual content with code-switching common in social media
  - Maintain privacy and proper data handling

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. Social media text preprocessing specialized for:
   - Short-form content with non-standard grammar
   - Hashtag segmentation and analysis
   - Username and mention handling
   - URL normalization and categorization
   - Emoji/emoticon semantic integration

2. Sentiment analysis frameworks that:
   - Incorporate both textual and symbolic emotional indicators
   - Detect sarcasm and implicit sentiment
   - Recognize informal sentiment expressions
   - Account for context in ambiguous statements
   - Provide granular emotional category classification

3. Trend detection algorithms for:
   - Identifying statistically significant frequency spikes
   - Recognizing emerging term co-occurrences
   - Detecting novel hashtag formations
   - Tracking conversation velocity and acceleration
   - Categorizing trending topics by type (organic, promotional, etc.)

4. Language variation analysis capabilities:
   - Vocabulary fingerprinting for demographic segments
   - Regional dialect and slang recognition
   - Interest community jargon identification
   - Language style clustering and classification
   - Cross-segment communication pattern comparison

5. Brand and competitor analysis tools:
   - Share-of-voice measurement
   - Messaging theme extraction and comparison
   - Sentiment differential analysis
   - Audience engagement pattern recognition
   - Brand-specific language model development

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of sentiment analysis with emoji/emoticon integration
  - Precision and recall of trend detection algorithms
  - Correctness of demographic language variation identification
  - Reliability of competitor comparison metrics
  - Performance with high-volume data streams

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Monitoring real-time brand mentions during marketing campaigns
  - Analyzing sentiment shifts following product announcements
  - Identifying emerging crises from sudden sentiment changes
  - Tracking competitor messaging strategies over time
  - Discovering demographic-specific language patterns around products

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Process at least 1,000 tweets/posts per second for streaming analysis
  - Complete full sentiment analysis of 10,000+ posts in under 5 minutes
  - Detect significant trends within 15 minutes of emergence
  - Handle datasets of 1M+ posts for historical analysis
  - Maintain acceptable memory usage during extended processing

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Processing multilingual posts with code-switching
  - Handling excessive emoji use or emoji-only messages
  - Adapting to platform-specific formatting and conventions
  - Managing very short posts with limited linguistic content
  - Processing spam patterns without false positive trend detection

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90%+ coverage of all analysis algorithms
  - Comprehensive testing of emoji/emoticon semantic integration
  - Validation against human-labeled sentiment datasets
  - Verification of trend detection against historical examples
  - Testing with diverse social media content types

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
