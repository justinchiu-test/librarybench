# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Framework

A specialized natural language processing toolkit for analyzing social media content, detecting trends, and measuring brand sentiment across platforms with support for informal language patterns.

## Overview

This project provides a robust framework for processing and analyzing large volumes of social media content with specialized attention to informal language, emojis, slang, and evolving linguistic patterns. The toolkit enables real-time trend detection, sentiment analysis, demographic language variation, and competitive brand comparison specifically tailored for marketing professionals.

## Persona Description

Sophia monitors brand mentions and customer sentiment across social platforms for a marketing agency. She needs lightweight text analysis tools that can process large volumes of informal social media content with specialized language patterns and evolving slang.

## Key Requirements

1. **Emoji and Emoticon Semantic Integration**: Develop a comprehensive system that incorporates non-textual sentiment indicators (emojis, emoticons, reaction GIFs) into text analysis.
   - This feature is critical for Sophia because a significant portion of social media sentiment is conveyed through non-textual elements that traditional NLP systems ignore.
   - The system must accurately interpret the semantic and emotional content of these elements in context, recognizing that the same emoji can convey different meanings in different situations.

2. **Real-time Trend Detection**: Create an algorithm to identify emerging topics, hashtags, and viral language patterns as they develop across social platforms.
   - This capability allows Sophia to spot emerging conversations about brands before they become widespread, enabling proactive response to potential issues or opportunities.
   - The system must distinguish between normal conversation variations and genuinely emerging trends, with minimal false positives.

3. **Brand Sentiment Visualization**: Implement a framework that maps emotional associations with specific products, showing nuanced sentiment beyond simple positive/negative classification.
   - This feature helps Sophia understand not just whether consumers feel positively or negatively about a brand, but the specific emotions associated with it (trust, excitement, frustration, etc.).
   - The visualization must be quantifiable and trackable over time to measure emotional response to campaigns and product changes.

4. **Demographic Language Variation Analysis**: Develop tools to identify how different user groups (age, region, interest communities) discuss products using distinct linguistic patterns.
   - This capability enables Sophia to understand how perception of brands varies across different audience segments based on their unique communication styles.
   - The analysis must detect and categorize language patterns specific to different demographic groups without requiring explicit demographic data.

5. **Competitor Comparison Framework**: Build analytical tools for comparing messaging, sentiment, and engagement across competing brands in the same industry.
   - This feature allows Sophia to benchmark client performance against competitors and identify successful messaging strategies in the market.
   - The framework must enable fair comparison across brands with different audience sizes and posting frequencies.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All analysis algorithms must produce consistent, reproducible results with the same inputs
- Sentiment analysis must be testable against human-annotated datasets with measurable accuracy metrics
- Trend detection must be verifiable against historical data of known viral content
- Performance on multilingual and code-switching content must be testable
- All modules must support unit testing with appropriate mocks and fixtures

### Performance Expectations
- Process and analyze at least 10,000 social media posts per minute
- Detect emerging trends within 15 minutes of their initial appearance in data
- Update sentiment analysis in near real-time (< 5 second lag) for monitored brands
- Support incremental processing of continuous social media streams
- Handle peak loads during viral events or crisis situations without degradation

### Integration Points
- Accept standardized social media data formats (JSON, CSV) with platform-specific metadata
- Support batch processing of historical data and stream processing of real-time content
- Enable export of analysis results to standard formats (CSV, JSON) for reporting systems
- Provide hooks for custom lexicons and sentiment dictionaries
- Allow extension with custom analysis modules for specific requirements

### Key Constraints
- Implementation must use only Python standard library
- Analysis must be resilient to rapidly evolving language patterns
- System must handle multilingual content and code-switching
- Processing must be effective on short-form content (tweets, comments)
- Algorithms must adapt to new emojis and slang without reprogramming
- Memory usage must be optimized for continuous processing of large data streams

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Multimodal Sentiment Analyzer**: A framework for integrating text and non-textual elements in sentiment analysis. It should:
   - Interpret emojis, emoticons, and other non-textual elements in context
   - Recognize sentiment modifications from emoji placement and sequences
   - Calculate composite sentiment scores from textual and non-textual components
   - Adapt to new emojis and changing usage patterns
   - Support platform-specific emoji interpretation

2. **Trend Detection Engine**: A system for identifying emerging topics and language patterns. It should:
   - Monitor frequency and acceleration of terms, phrases, and hashtags
   - Detect unusual patterns indicating viral potential
   - Distinguish between organic and promoted/bot-driven trends
   - Identify trend sources and propagation patterns
   - Predict trend trajectories based on early signals

3. **Emotional Sentiment Mapping**: A framework for nuanced emotional analysis beyond positive/negative. It should:
   - Categorize content into specific emotional states (joy, trust, anger, etc.)
   - Track emotional associations with brands and products over time
   - Detect emotional shifts following product launches or PR events
   - Quantify emotional intensity and conviction
   - Recognize cultural and contextual factors affecting emotional expression

4. **Demographic Language Analyzer**: Tools for identifying language patterns associated with user groups. It should:
   - Detect linguistic markers of different age groups, regions, and communities
   - Classify content by likely demographic origin without personal data
   - Track how different groups discuss the same brands or products
   - Identify demographic-specific slang and terminology
   - Monitor changes in demographic language patterns over time

5. **Competitive Intelligence Framework**: A system for comparative brand analysis. It should:
   - Normalize engagement metrics across brands of different sizes
   - Compare sentiment profiles between competing products
   - Identify messaging strategies that generate positive response
   - Track relative brand performance over time
   - Analyze share of voice in industry conversations

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using uv:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. Install testing tools:
   ```
   pip install pytest pytest-json-report
   ```

5. Run tests with JSON reporting:
   ```
