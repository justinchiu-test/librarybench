# Social Media Text Analytics Library

A natural language processing toolkit optimized for analyzing informal social media content and extracting marketing insights.

## Overview

This project provides specialized text analysis capabilities for processing large volumes of social media content, focusing on emoji interpretation, trend detection, sentiment analysis, demographic language variation, and competitive messaging analysis. It helps marketing professionals extract actionable insights from unstructured social conversations.

## Persona Description

Sophia monitors brand mentions and customer sentiment across social platforms for a marketing agency. She needs lightweight text analysis tools that can process large volumes of informal social media content with specialized language patterns and evolving slang.

## Key Requirements

1. **Emoji and Emoticon Semantic Integration**: Develop comprehensive processing for non-textual sentiment indicators including emoji, emoticons, and special characters common in social media. This feature is critical for Sophia because a significant proportion of sentiment and meaning in social posts is conveyed through these symbols rather than conventional text, making them essential for accurate analysis.

2. **Trend Detection**: Create algorithms to identify emerging topics, hashtags, and viral language patterns in near real-time from stream of social media data. This capability allows Sophia to spot emerging conversations about brands before they become widespread, giving her clients a competitive advantage in responding to market dynamics and consumer interests.

3. **Brand Sentiment Visualization**: Implement sophisticated sentiment analysis specifically calibrated for brand mentions, capturing emotional associations and attitude patterns related to products and services. For Sophia, understanding not just whether sentiment is positive or negative but the specific emotional associations with brands provides actionable marketing intelligence her clients need.

4. **Demographic Language Variation Analysis**: Build capabilities to identify and categorize language patterns associated with different user demographics based on vocabulary, slang usage, and communication styles. This allows Sophia to segment conversations by likely demographic groups without requiring personal user data, providing crucial audience insights for targeted marketing strategies.

5. **Competitor Comparison Framework**: Develop analysis tools to systematically compare messaging, sentiment, and engagement patterns between competing brands in the same market sector. This framework enables Sophia to provide clients with competitive intelligence about messaging effectiveness and audience perception relative to market alternatives.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All text processing functions must handle social media conventions (hashtags, @mentions, etc.)
- Emoji analysis must cover standard Unicode emoji sets with semantic categorization
- Trend detection algorithms must be testable with timestamp-tagged data
- Sentiment analysis must be benchmarkable against human-labeled datasets
- Demographic analysis must be evaluated against known demographic language samples

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 10,000 social media posts per minute
- Trend detection with latency under 60 seconds for streaming data
- Support incremental processing of continuous data streams
- Memory-efficient handling of high-volume text data
- Near real-time sentiment analysis for monitoring dashboards

### Integration Points
- Standard data formats for social media content (JSON, CSV)
- Time-series output compatible with analytics tools
- Sentiment data structures supporting multidimensional analysis
- Demographic categorization compatible with marketing segmentation frameworks
- Competitor analysis outputs in comparative matrix formats

### Key Constraints
- Implementation using only Python standard library (no external NLP or ML dependencies)
- Processing optimized for short-form content (under 280 characters)
- Algorithms must adapt to rapidly evolving language patterns
- Support for multilingual content and code-switching common in social media
- Functionality must accommodate platform-specific conventions (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality required for this project includes:

1. **Social Media Text Preprocessing**
   - Specialized tokenization for social media conventions
   - Emoji and emoticon normalization and interpretation
   - Handling of platform-specific features (hashtags, mentions, etc.)
   - Slang and abbreviation normalization
   - Noise filtering for social media content

2. **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**
   - Brand-specific sentiment detection
   - Emoji-enhanced emotion classification
   - Context-aware polarity determination
   - Sarcasm and irony detection
   - Emotion intensity scoring

3. **Trend and Viral Content Detection**
   - Temporal pattern recognition
   - Emerging topic identification
   - Velocity and acceleration metrics for content spread
   - Hashtag clustering and relationship mapping
   - Anomaly detection for viral breakouts

4. **Demographic Language Analysis**
   - Sociolinguistic feature extraction
   - Demographic language modeling
   - Age/generation-specific pattern detection
   - Regional and cultural dialect identification
   - Demographic segmentation algorithms

5. **Competitive Intelligence Framework**
   - Brand mention extraction and categorization
   - Comparative sentiment analysis
   - Share-of-voice calculation
   - Messaging differentiation metrics
   - Competitive positioning analysis

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct interpretation of emoji sentiment in diverse contexts
- Accurate identification of emerging trends from time-series data
- Precise sentiment analysis calibrated for brand mentions
- Reliable demographic pattern recognition based on language use
- Valid comparative analysis between competitive brands

### Critical User Scenarios
- Monitoring sentiment shifts following a product launch
- Identifying emerging language trends relevant to client brands
- Analyzing emotional associations with specific product features
- Segmenting conversations by likely demographic groups
- Comparing messaging effectiveness between market competitors

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process 50,000 tweets in under 5 minutes

- Sentiment analysis matching human judgment in 80%+ of cases
- Demographic classification with 75%+ accuracy against test datasets
- Complete competitive analysis for 5+ brands in under 10 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of multilingual and code-switching content
- Processing of content with high emoji density or novel emoji usage
- Adaptation to rapidly emerging slang and memes
- Management of platform-specific formatting and constraints
- Processing of ironic, sarcastic, or otherwise contextually complex expressions
- Handling of adversarial content designed to confuse sentiment analysis

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 90% code coverage for core text processing components
- 95% coverage for emoji and emoticon handling
- 90% coverage for trend detection algorithms
- 90% coverage for sentiment analysis systems
- 85% coverage for demographic analysis components
- 90% coverage for competitor comparison framework

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Emoji and emoticons are correctly interpreted as part of sentiment analysis with accuracy comparable to human judgment
2. Emerging trends are detected early enough to provide actionable marketing intelligence
3. Brand sentiment analysis provides multidimensional emotional insights beyond binary positive/negative classification
4. Demographic language patterns can be reliably identified with statistical significance
5. Competitive brand comparisons yield actionable insights about positioning and messaging effectiveness
6. All analyses can be performed at scale with performance suitable for near real-time monitoring
