# Customer Support Request Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized natural language processing toolkit designed for customer support automation, focusing on intent classification, information extraction, sentiment analysis, response suggestion, and conversation flow modeling to improve response efficiency for high-volume support tickets.

## Persona Description
Raj develops automation for customer service teams handling high volumes of support tickets. He needs to analyze incoming requests, categorize issues, and extract actionable information to improve response efficiency.

## Key Requirements
1. **Intent Classification**: Develop algorithms to determine the primary purpose of customer messages, categorizing them into common support request types such as technical issues, billing inquiries, product questions, feature requests, or complaints. This enables accurate routing and prioritization, ensuring each request reaches the appropriate support team and receives the proper response template.

2. **Information Extraction**: Implement extraction capabilities to identify critical details from unstructured customer messages, including product names, version numbers, error codes, account identifiers, timestamps, and steps already attempted. This eliminates the need for support agents to manually search for key information, significantly reducing response time.

3. **Sentiment Escalation**: Create sentiment analysis specialized for support contexts to detect emotionally charged messages indicating customer frustration, urgency, or dissatisfaction that may require expedited handling or escalation. This prevents negative customer experiences by identifying high-risk interactions before they deteriorate further.

4. **Response Suggestion**: Design a framework for generating context-sensitive template-based replies for common scenarios, leveraging extracted information to personalize responses appropriately. This dramatically increases agent efficiency by providing ready-to-use response foundations that can be quickly customized rather than drafted from scratch.

5. **Conversation Flow Modeling**: Develop capabilities to track multi-message interactions between customers and agents, understanding context across conversation threads and identifying resolution paths and completion stages. This helps support teams understand where each customer stands in their resolution journey and what next steps are appropriate.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All classification algorithms must produce consistent, deterministic results
  - Intent classification must be testable against labeled support tickets
  - Information extraction must be verifiable with annotated messages
  - Sentiment analysis must align with human judgment on escalation needs
  - Response suggestions must meet quality and appropriateness standards

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Process support messages (typically 50-500 words) in near real-time
  - Handle high volumes of incoming tickets (thousands per day)
  - Support concurrent analysis of active conversation threads
  - Generate response suggestions with minimal latency
  - Maintain performance consistency during peak support periods

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for common ticket format imports
  - Extraction of structured data from unstructured text
  - Classification output compatible with ticketing systems
  - Support for ticket metadata incorporation
  - Template system integration for response generation

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Use only Python standard library without external dependencies
  - Handle diverse writing styles, language proficiency, and technical accuracy
  - Support multi-turn conversations with context maintenance
  - Accommodate product-specific terminology and error codes
  - Balance automation efficiency with quality of customer experience

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement:

1. Support request intent classification:
   - Multi-class categorization of support requests
   - Confidence scoring for classification decisions
   - Hybrid classification using keywords and patterns
   - Issue type and subtype hierarchical classification
   - Product-specific intent recognition

2. Technical information extraction frameworks:
   - Product name and version recognition
   - Error code and message identification
   - System configuration detail extraction
   - User action and attempt history parsing
   - Account and order identifier recognition

3. Support-specific sentiment analysis:
   - Urgency and priority detection
   - Frustration and dissatisfaction recognition
   - Escalation need prediction
   - Customer loyalty risk assessment
   - Conversation tone tracking over time

4. Response generation capabilities:
   - Template selection based on intent and context
   - Dynamic field population from extracted information
   - Response customization suggestions
   - Follow-up question generation
   - Appropriate tone matching for situation

5. Conversation and ticket lifecycle tracking:
   - Conversation state modeling
   - Resolution pathway identification
   - Multi-message context maintenance
   - Next-step prediction for resolution
   - Similar case matching for solution reference

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of intent classification across support categories
  - Precision and recall of information extraction
  - Reliability of sentiment analysis for escalation decisions
  - Appropriateness of response suggestions
  - Effectiveness of conversation flow modeling

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Processing incoming technical support requests
  - Analyzing billing dispute messages
  - Handling product information inquiries
  - Managing multi-message troubleshooting conversations
  - Detecting high-priority issues needing immediate attention

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Classify support requests into categories with 90%+ accuracy
  - Extract key technical information with 85%+ precision
  - Identify escalation-needed messages with high recall (>90%)
  - Generate appropriate response suggestions for 80%+ of common requests
  - Process standard support messages in under 1 second

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling multi-issue support requests
  - Processing messages with minimal information
  - Managing conversations with multiple topic switches
  - Dealing with technical language and jargon
  - Accommodating non-native speakers with language difficulties

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90%+ coverage of all analysis algorithms
  - Comprehensive testing with diverse support request types
  - Validation with actual (anonymized) support ticket data
  - Testing across different product lines and issue categories
  - Verification of multi-turn conversation handling

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Intent classification correctly categorizes support requests for appropriate routing
2. Information extraction reliably identifies key technical details from unstructured messages
3. Sentiment escalation accurately identifies high-priority issues needing urgent attention
4. Response suggestion generates appropriate template-based replies for common scenarios
5. Conversation flow modeling effectively tracks support interactions toward resolution
6. The system processes support requests with sufficient speed for high-volume environments
7. Classification accuracy meets or exceeds 90% for common support categories
8. Information extraction reduces the need for clarification questions from agents
9. Support teams experience measurable efficiency improvements through automation
10. The quality of customer experience is maintained or enhanced through automation

## Development Environment
To set up the development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
