# NetScope - API Performance Optimization Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer focused on analyzing HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient requests, and optimization opportunities in API implementations for high-traffic web applications.

## Persona Description
Sophia optimizes web APIs for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. She needs to analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient requests, and opportunities for optimization in API implementations.

## Key Requirements
1. **API call aggregation grouping similar endpoints and measuring their performance characteristics**
   - Implement pattern-based endpoint recognition to automatically group related API calls
   - Create statistical analysis tools for response time distributions across endpoint groups
   - Include trend analysis to identify degrading performance over time
   - Develop endpoint correlation to identify cascading API calls and dependencies

2. **Payload efficiency analysis identifying redundant data in requests and responses**
   - Implement content analysis for HTTP payloads to identify duplicate or redundant data
   - Create payload compression ratio measurement and optimization recommendations
   - Include detection of unnecessary fields and overfetching patterns
   - Develop suggestions for more efficient data serialization formats

3. **Cache effectiveness measurement showing hit/miss ratios and potential optimizations**
   - Implement detection of cacheable vs. non-cacheable responses based on headers
   - Create analysis of actual cache utilization based on repeated requests
   - Include identification of missed caching opportunities
   - Develop recommendations for optimal cache TTL values and cache control headers

4. **Session flow visualization mapping typical user interaction sequences**
   - Create functionality to reconstruct user sessions from API traffic
   - Implement path analysis to identify common interaction patterns
   - Include performance measurements for typical user journeys
   - Develop identification of redundant API calls within user sessions

5. **Microservice dependency tracking showing cross-service communication patterns and bottlenecks**
   - Implement service boundary detection based on API traffic patterns
   - Create dependency graphs showing service-to-service communication
   - Include latency analysis for inter-service communications
   - Develop detection of circular dependencies and other anti-patterns

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
  - Include HTTP traffic simulation capabilities for reproducible testing
  - Support mocking of API responses with configurable latency and payload characteristics
  - Implement benchmark tests for performance comparison between optimizations

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Process and analyze traffic from APIs handling at least 1000 requests per second
  - Complete comprehensive analysis of a day's API traffic (millions of requests) in under 30 minutes
  - Generate optimization reports within minutes even for complex API ecosystems
  - Support continuous monitoring with minimal impact on production systems

- **Integration Points**
  - Integration with packet capture libraries for API traffic monitoring
  - Support for importing HAR files and other HTTP archive formats
  - Export capabilities for integration with performance dashboards and monitoring systems
  - Command-line interface for integration with CI/CD pipelines

- **Key Constraints**
  - Implementation must be in Python with minimal external dependencies
  - Analysis must function with only network traffic (no application source code required)
  - Solution must handle TLS-encrypted traffic (assuming proper decryption is available)
  - No user interface components should be implemented; focus solely on API and library functionality
  - All functionality must be accessible programmatically through well-documented interfaces

## Core Functionality
The core functionality includes HTTP/HTTPS traffic analysis with special focus on API patterns, request and response payload analysis, cache effectiveness evaluation, user flow reconstruction, and service dependency mapping.

The system will parse HTTP/HTTPS packets to reconstruct full requests and responses, analyze headers and payloads, track sessions using cookies or other identifiers, and build models of API behavior and performance characteristics. It will maintain statistical data on response times, payload sizes, compression ratios, cache hit rates, and other performance metrics.

The implementation should automatically identify API endpoints and group them based on patterns, detect relationships between endpoints, and identify performance bottlenecks at both the individual endpoint and system level. It should provide detailed recommendations for API optimization based on observed traffic patterns.

For cache analysis, the system should examine cache-related headers, identify repeated requests for the same resources, and calculate potential performance improvements from optimal caching strategies. Similarly, for payload analysis, it should identify opportunities for reducing data transfer through compression, field filtering, or protocol optimizations.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate identification and grouping of API endpoints
  - Reliable payload efficiency analysis and optimization recommendations
  - Precise cache effectiveness measurement and opportunity identification
  - Effective user session reconstruction and flow visualization
  - Accurate service dependency mapping and bottleneck identification

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Analyzing a high-traffic e-commerce API during peak shopping periods
  - Identifying performance bottlenecks in a complex microservice architecture
  - Optimizing payload sizes for mobile API clients with limited bandwidth
  - Improving cache strategies for frequently accessed, relatively static data
  - Mapping user journeys to identify redundant API calls in common workflows

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Complete API endpoint analysis for 10 million requests within 15 minutes
  - Payload efficiency analysis processing at least 100 MB of JSON/XML data per minute
  - Session flow reconstruction handling at least 100,000 user sessions per analysis run
  - Service dependency mapping completing in under 5 minutes for architectures with 50+ services

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Handling malformed HTTP requests and responses
  - Processing partial captures with incomplete request/response pairs
  - Analyzing APIs with non-standard HTTP implementations
  - Dealing with binary data formats and non-textual payloads
  - Managing analysis across load-balanced systems with request distribution

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for all analysis components
  - 100% coverage of public APIs
  - Comprehensive testing of HTTP header parsing edge cases
  - Performance testing under various load conditions
