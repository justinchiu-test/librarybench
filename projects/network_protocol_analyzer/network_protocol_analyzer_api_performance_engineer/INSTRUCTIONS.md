# NetScope for API Performance Optimization

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer focused on analyzing HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns to help API performance engineers identify bottlenecks, inefficient requests, and optimization opportunities in high-traffic web API implementations.

## Persona Description
Sophia optimizes web APIs for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. She needs to analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient requests, and opportunities for optimization in API implementations.

   - Support for custom endpoint grouping rules and pattern definitions

2. **Payload efficiency analysis identifying redundant data in requests and responses**
   - Implement content analysis for HTTP request and response bodies
   - Develop algorithms to detect repeated data structures, unused fields, and inefficient encodings
   - Create comparison tools to evaluate the same API calls across different versions or implementations
   - Include size optimization recommendations with estimated bandwidth savings
   - Support for common API formats including JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers, and GraphQL

3. **Cache effectiveness measurement showing hit/miss ratios and potential optimizations**
   - Develop heuristics to detect cache usage from observable network patterns

   - Implement session reconstruction from HTTP traffic with correlation across multiple connections
   - Develop visualization of user journeys through API calls with timing information
   - Create analysis algorithms to identify common paths and bottlenecks in user flows
   - Include tools to simulate performance improvements from specific optimizations
   - Support for multi-user session analysis with aggregated patterns

5. **Microservice dependency tracking showing cross-service communication patterns and bottlenecks**
   - Implement service boundary detection from network traffic patterns
   - Develop visualization of inter-service dependencies and communication frequency

   - Support for distributed tracing header correlation when present in traffic

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All API endpoint aggregation algorithms must be testable with captured HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Payload analysis must be verifiable against known inefficient and optimized examples
- Cache effectiveness metrics must be testable with predefined traffic patterns
- Session flow reconstruction must be verifiable against known user journeys
- Microservice dependency analysis must be tested against defined service architectures

### Performance Expectations
- Analysis tools must process captures containing at least 1 million API calls in under 10 minutes
- Memory usage should scale linearly with unique endpoint count rather than total traffic volume
- Real-time monitoring capabilities should handle sustained traffic equivalent to 1000 API calls per second
- Interactive visualizations should render within 2 seconds even for complex dependency graphs

### Integration Points
- Import capabilities for PCAP files from standard HTTP capture tools
- Integration with API gateway logs and web server access logs
- Export formats compatible with performance monitoring and APM systems
- APIs for integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous performance testing

### Key Constraints
- Must handle TLS/SSL encrypted traffic with appropriate access to keys
- Must support HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocols
- Analysis should work with partial captures and incomplete sessions
- Must handle various authentication mechanisms without requiring credentials
- Should respect privacy by enabling data anonymization of sensitive information

## Core Functionality
The API Performance Optimization version of NetScope must provide specialized analysis capabilities focused on HTTP-based API communications. The system should enable performance engineers to understand API usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, measure caching effectiveness, visualize user flows, and analyze service dependencies.

Key functional components include:
- API endpoint discovery and classification system
- Payload content analysis and optimization framework
- Cache effectiveness measurement tools
- Session reconstruction and flow visualization
- Microservice dependency and performance impact analysis

The system should provide both detailed technical analysis for API developers and summary reports suitable for communicating with product and engineering leadership. All recommendations should be evidence-based, drawing on actual usage patterns observed in captured API traffic.
