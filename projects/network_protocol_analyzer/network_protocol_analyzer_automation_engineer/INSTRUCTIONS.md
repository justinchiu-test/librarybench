# Network Automation Protocol Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer designed for network automation engineers to validate the effects of automated configuration changes. The tool focuses on comparing network behavior before and after changes, validating configuration changes against traffic patterns, verifying that automation achieves intended outcomes, simulating failure scenarios, and integrating with existing automation pipelines for continuous monitoring.

## Persona Description
Priya develops automation systems for large network infrastructures. She needs to understand and verify the behavior of automated network configuration changes and ensure they produce the expected traffic patterns.

## Key Requirements

1. **Before/After Comparison Visualization**
   - Implement detailed analysis that captures and compares network behavior patterns before and after automated configuration changes
   - Critical for Priya because understanding exactly how network traffic patterns change following automated updates is essential for validating that automation produces the expected outcomes without unintended consequences

2. **Configuration Change Validation**
   - Create a system to correlate specific network device configuration changes with resulting changes in traffic patterns
   - Essential for Priya to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships between configuration adjustments and network behavior, ensuring that automated changes have the precise impact intended

3. **Intent Verification**
   - Develop a framework for defining expected network behavior intent and automatically validating that actual traffic patterns match these expectations
   - Vital for Priya to ensure that automated changes not only execute correctly but actually achieve the desired network states and behaviors defined in intent-based automation policies

4. **Failure Scenario Simulation**
   - Implement predictive analysis to model the impact of potential automation errors on traffic patterns
   - Necessary for Priya to proactively identify risks in automation scripts before deployment, preventing outages and ensuring robust automated changes that can handle edge cases

5. **API-Driven Analysis Integration**
   - Create comprehensive APIs that enable integration with network automation pipelines for continuous monitoring
   - Critical for Priya to embed traffic analysis directly into automation workflows, enabling closed-loop verification and remediation when automated changes don't produce expected results

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All analysis functions must be testable with captured traffic samples
  - Configuration correlation must be verifiable with sample device configurations
  - Intent validation must support formal verification techniques
  - All components must support automated testing without requiring actual network devices

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must process at least 1GB of network traffic data in under 60 seconds
  - Configuration analysis must support at least 1,000 device configuration files concurrently
  - API response time for analysis queries must be under 100ms
  - System should handle analysis of up to 10 different network segments simultaneously

- **Integration Points**
  - Must provide REST APIs for integration with common automation platforms (Ansible, Terraform, etc.)
  - Should support importing configuration data from network device APIs
  - Must integrate with standard network monitoring sources (NetFlow, sFlow, PCAP)
  - Should support webhook notifications for automated alerting

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must operate securely with encrypted credential handling
  - Should function without requiring direct device access (working from captures)
  - Must support multi-vendor network environments
  - Should operate in both agent and agentless modes

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a comprehensive library for network automation verification with the following components:

1. **Before/After Analysis Engine**
   - Baseline traffic pattern establishment
   - Statistical comparison of pre-change and post-change network behavior
   - Anomaly detection for unexpected traffic pattern changes
   - Visualization data generation for comparing network states

2. **Configuration-Traffic Correlation Framework**
   - Configuration change parser and classifier
   - Traffic pattern change detection and measurement
   - Statistical correlation between specific configuration changes and traffic impacts
   - Network topology understanding for contextual analysis

3. **Intent Validation System**
   - Intent definition language for specifying expected network behavior
   - Formal verification of traffic patterns against defined intents
   - Conformance scoring and deviation measurement
   - Explainable results for understanding intent violations

4. **Failure Impact Prediction**
   - "What-if" analysis for potential automation failures
   - Fault injection simulation for automation scripts
   - Risk scoring for different failure modes
   - Mitigation recommendation for high-risk scenarios

5. **Automation Integration API**
   - Comprehensive REST API for embedding in automation workflows
   - Webhook system for event notifications
   - Structured result formats for machine consumption
   - Authentication and access control for secure integration

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Before/after analysis correctly identifies significant traffic pattern changes
  - Configuration correlation accurately links specific config changes to traffic effects
  - Intent verification properly validates traffic patterns against defined expectations
  - Failure simulation correctly predicts the impact of potential automation errors
  - API integration functions properly with common automation platforms

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Validating a routing policy change in a large enterprise network
  - Verifying security policy implementation across multiple network segments
  - Troubleshooting unexpected traffic patterns following automated updates
  - Predicting the impact of a major network reconfiguration
  - Integrating traffic analysis into a CI/CD pipeline for network changes

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Process and analyze 1GB of network traffic in under 60 seconds
  - Support correlation analysis across 1,000+ device configurations simultaneously
  - Complete intent verification for 100 intent rules in under 30 seconds
  - Simulate at least 10 different failure scenarios in under 2 minutes
  - Handle at least 100 concurrent API requests with response times under 100ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Accurate analysis with partial configuration data
  - Proper handling of multi-vendor environments with different command syntaxes
  - Correct operation during network transition states
  - Graceful degradation with incomplete traffic data
  - Robust operation with conflicting intent specifications

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for API endpoints and integration points
  - Comprehensive tests for all supported configuration formats
  - Performance tests verifying all specified benchmarks
  - Security tests ensuring proper credential handling

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
