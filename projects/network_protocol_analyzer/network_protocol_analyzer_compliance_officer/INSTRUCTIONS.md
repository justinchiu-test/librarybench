# Regulatory Compliance Network Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer designed for legal compliance officers to ensure adherence to data protection regulations and privacy laws. The tool focuses on detecting sensitive information in network traffic, verifying compliance boundaries, validating encryption implementation, mapping cross-border data flows, and generating comprehensive regulatory documentation to meet audit requirements.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen ensures corporate networks comply with data protection regulations and privacy laws. She needs to verify that sensitive information is properly secured and not transmitted in violation of compliance requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Sensitive Data Detection**
   - Implement advanced pattern recognition to identify personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, health information, and other regulated data types in network traffic
   - Critical for Dr. Chen because undetected sensitive data transmission can lead to regulatory violations, fines, and reputational damage to the organization

2. **Compliance Boundary Verification**
   - Create a system to define and monitor compliance boundaries that ensure regulated data only traverses approved systems and networks
   - Essential for Dr. Chen because many regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) require strict controls on where sensitive data can be stored and transmitted, making boundary violations a serious compliance risk

3. **Encryption Verification**
   - Develop tools to validate that appropriate encryption protocols and key strengths are used for all sensitive communications
   - Vital for Dr. Chen to ensure that data in transit is protected according to regulatory requirements and industry best practices, preventing potential data breaches and compliance violations

4. **Data Transfer Geographical Mapping**
   - Implement IP geolocation and routing analysis to identify and document cross-border information flows
   - Necessary for Dr. Chen to comply with regulations like GDPR that place restrictions on international data transfers and require documentation of such transfers

5. **Regulatory Reporting Assistance**
   - Create comprehensive evidence collection and report generation capabilities to document compliance posture for regulatory audits
   - Critical for Dr. Chen to efficiently demonstrate compliance to auditors, reducing audit preparation time and ensuring all required documentation is available and accurate

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All data detection patterns must be testable with synthetic datasets
  - Boundary verification must be testable with simulated traffic crossing defined boundaries
  - Encryption verification must validate against defined security standards
  - All components must support audit logging for verification of proper operation

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Must process enterprise-scale traffic (minimum 1GB/hour) with under 10% CPU utilization on standard server hardware
  - Pattern matching must complete within 10ms per packet to support real-time monitoring
  - Reporting functions must generate comprehensive reports for 30 days of traffic within 5 minutes
  - System must support concurrent monitoring of at least 100 network segments

- **Integration Points**
  - Must integrate with standard network monitoring frameworks (SNMP, sFlow, NetFlow)
  - Should provide APIs for integration with governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platforms
  - Must support importing industry-standard data classification schemas
  - Should integrate with existing data loss prevention (DLP) systems

- **Key Constraints**
  - Analysis must not store actual sensitive data, only metadata about detections
  - Must support configurable policies based on different regulatory frameworks
  - All logging must be tamper-evident to support chain of custody for evidence
  - System must operate without sending any data outside the organization's network

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a comprehensive library for compliance-focused network analysis with the following components:

1. **Sensitive Data Detection Engine**
   - Pattern matching for various types of regulated data (PII, PHI, PCI, etc.)
   - Context-aware analysis to reduce false positives
   - Regular expression framework with pre-built patterns for common sensitive data types
   - Extensible architecture for custom data type definitions

2. **Compliance Boundary Framework**
   - Definition system for network zones and permitted data flows
   - Real-time validation of traffic against defined boundaries
   - Violation logging with detailed context for investigation
   - Risk scoring for different types of boundary violations

3. **Encryption Analysis Module**
   - Protocol identification and validation against security standards
   - Key strength assessment and certificate validation
   - Cryptographic algorithm verification
   - TLS/SSL configuration checking against best practices

4. **Geographical Data Flow Mapper**
   - IP geolocation database integration
   - Route analysis for identifying transit countries
   - Visualization data generation for cross-border flows
   - Regulatory impact assessment based on countries involved

5. **Audit Reporting System**
   - Comprehensive evidence collection with chain of custody
   - Configurable report templates for different regulatory frameworks
   - Statistical analysis of compliance metrics
   - Historical trending and compliance posture tracking

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Sensitive data detection correctly identifies regulated data types with high precision and recall
  - Compliance boundary verification accurately flags unauthorized data movements
  - Encryption verification properly validates security of communications
  - Geographical mapping correctly identifies cross-border data transfers
  - Reporting functions generate accurate and complete documentation

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Daily compliance monitoring of enterprise network traffic
  - Investigation of potential data exfiltration incidents
  - Preparation for regulatory audits and inspections
  - Assessment of compliance impact from network architecture changes
  - Documentation of encryption standards across the organization

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Process at least 1GB of network traffic per hour with less than 10% CPU utilization
  - Complete sensitive data scans with at least 95% accuracy (F1 score)
  - Generate comprehensive compliance reports covering 30 days of traffic in under 5 minutes
  - Support concurrent monitoring of at least 100 different network segments
  - Maintain detection latency below 10ms per packet for real-time monitoring

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Accurate detection in fragmented or encrypted packets
  - Proper handling of nested data formats and compression
  - Graceful operation during network congestion or packet loss
  - Correct processing of international character sets and encodings
  - Robust operation with malformed packets or protocol violations

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 95% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for sensitive data detection patterns
  - Comprehensive tests for all supported regulatory frameworks
  - Performance tests verifying all specified benchmarks
  - Validation tests ensuring no false negatives for critical data types

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
