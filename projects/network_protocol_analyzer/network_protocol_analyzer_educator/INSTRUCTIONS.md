# NetScope - Educational Network Protocol Visualization and Analysis Tool

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer designed for cybersecurity education, providing clear visualizations of protocol structures, simulated attack scenarios, progressive complexity levels, collaborative analysis capabilities, and guided discovery of protocol vulnerabilities.

## Persona Description
Professor Wong teaches network security courses and needs to provide students with hands-on experience analyzing network protocols and security vulnerabilities. He requires a tool that clearly illustrates protocol structures and common attack vectors for educational purposes.

## Key Requirements
1. **Protocol breakdown visualization showing each field and its purpose in packet headers**
   - Implement detailed parsing and labeling of protocol headers at all network layers
   - Create visualizations that clearly demarcate field boundaries, bit positions, and purposes
   - Include cross-referencing of actual values with RFC specifications
   - Develop interactive drill-down capabilities from high-level protocol overview to individual bit meanings

2. **Attack simulation sandboxing demonstrating common exploits in a controlled environment**
   - Implement a library of attack pattern generators for common network-based vulnerabilities
   - Create repeatable, deterministic simulation of attack traffic patterns
   - Include sample defensive responses and mitigation strategies
   - Develop protection to ensure simulated attacks cannot affect real systems

3. **Progressive complexity modes revealing different levels of detail based on student experience**
   - Implement tiered information display for beginner, intermediate, and advanced students
   - Create simplified views hiding unnecessary complexity for introductory courses
   - Include advanced analysis features for graduate-level courses
   - Develop customizable complexity profiles for different learning objectives

4. **Collaborative analysis allowing students to share and discuss findings within the tool**
   - Implement serialization of analysis results and annotations
   - Create exportable, shareable packet capture annotations
   - Include structured formats for documenting analysis findings
   - Develop mechanisms for instructors to review and provide feedback on student work

5. **Challenge scenarios with guided discovery of specific protocol vulnerabilities**
   - Implement a framework for creating tutorial-style analysis challenges
   - Create progressive hints to guide students toward discovering vulnerabilities
   - Include verification mechanisms to validate student findings
   - Develop scaffolded learning paths for different protocol vulnerabilities

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
  - Include validation of educational accuracy of protocol descriptions and security concepts
  - Support automated verification of challenge scenario completion
  - Implement reproducible simulation environments for consistent testing

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Process and analyze packet captures for classroom demonstrations in real-time
  - Support simultaneous analysis of at least 30 student packet captures
  - Generate protocol visualizations within seconds, even for complex protocols
  - Provide immediate feedback for challenge scenario submissions

- **Integration Points**
  - Integration with packet capture libraries for analyzing real or simulated traffic
  - Export formats compatible with educational learning management systems
  - API endpoints for integration with classroom lab environments
  - Command-line interface for scripted classroom demonstrations

- **Key Constraints**
  - Implementation must be in Python with minimal external dependencies
  - Analysis must function in isolated environments without internet access
  - Simulation of attacks must never generate actual malicious traffic
  - No user interface components should be implemented; focus solely on API and library functionality
  - All functionality must be accessible programmatically for integration with educational frameworks

## Core Functionality
The core functionality includes detailed protocol parsing with educational annotations, network attack pattern simulation, tiered complexity display management, collaborative analysis facilitation, and guided challenge scenario framework.

The system will parse network packets across multiple protocols with particular attention to educational value, providing clear, RFC-compliant descriptions of each field and its purpose. It will include a categorized library of common network attacks with sample traffic patterns, detailed explanations, and historical context where relevant.

The implementation should support progressive disclosure of complexity, allowing instructors to control the level of detail presented to students based on their experience level. Beginner views might show only essential protocol fields with simplified explanations, while advanced views would include obscure fields, bit-level details, and deeper technical context.

For collaborative analysis, the system should provide serializable annotations and findings that can be shared between students or submitted to instructors. Similarly, for challenge scenarios, it should offer a framework for creating guided exercises that lead students through the process of discovering and understanding network vulnerabilities through hands-on analysis.

  - A teaching assistant reviewing submitted student analyses

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Protocol visualization generation in under 2 seconds
  - Support for classrooms with up to 30 simultaneous users
  - Complete attack pattern simulation preparation in under 5 seconds
