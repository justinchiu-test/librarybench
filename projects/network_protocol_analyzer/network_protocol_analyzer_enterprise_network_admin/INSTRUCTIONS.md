# NetScope for Enterprise Network Administration

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer tailored for enterprise network administrators, focusing on troubleshooting complex infrastructure issues, identifying performance bottlenecks, validating segmentation policies, and ensuring proper configuration across diverse network environments.

## Persona Description
Michael manages network infrastructure for a large corporation with complex connectivity requirements. He needs to troubleshoot performance bottlenecks, identify misconfigured services, and ensure proper segmentation between network zones.

2. **Service dependency mapping showing which systems communicate with each other**
   - Create automated discovery of service communications patterns across the network
   - Implement algorithms to identify client-server relationships and service dependencies
   - Develop visualization of communication graphs with traffic volume and protocol information
   - Include change detection to identify new or modified service communication patterns
   - Support for passive service identification based on traffic characteristics

3. **Bandwidth utilization breakdown by application, protocol, and user groups**
   - Implement detailed traffic classification by application type, protocol, and business function
   - Develop time-series analysis of bandwidth consumption patterns with anomaly detection
   - Create attribution mechanisms linking traffic to user groups or business units where possible
   - Include prediction algorithms for capacity planning based on historical trends
   - Support for custom classification rules tailored to enterprise application portfolio

4. **Configuration validation identifying mismatched network settings between devices**
   - Develop passive detection of network configuration issues from observed traffic
   - Implement algorithms to identify duplex mismatches, MTU inconsistencies, and QoS misconfigurations
   - Create heuristics for detecting suboptimal routing and switching configurations
   - Include recommendations for configuration adjustments with estimated performance impact
   - Support for detecting protocol-specific misconfigurations (spanning tree, routing protocols, etc.)

5. **QoS (Quality of Service) verification ensuring priority traffic receives appropriate handling**
   - Implement analysis of DSCP/ToS markings and actual handling across the network path
   - Develop timing analysis to verify prioritization of marked traffic over lower-priority traffic
   - Create tools to identify QoS policy inconsistencies across network boundaries
   - Include reporting on QoS effectiveness for latency-sensitive applications
   - Support for enterprise-specific QoS policies and verification against them

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All segmentation analysis must be testable with predefined traffic patterns and policies
- Service dependency mapping must be verifiable against known network topologies
- Bandwidth classification algorithms must be testable with labeled traffic datasets
- Configuration issue detection must identify known problems in test traffic captures
- QoS analysis must verify correct handling against defined policies

### Performance Expectations
- Analysis tools must handle enterprise-scale traffic volumes (>10GB PCAP files)
- Processing should analyze at least 1 hour of 10Gbps network traffic capture in under 30 minutes
- Memory usage should scale linearly with traffic volume and remain under 8GB for typical analyses
- Real-time monitoring capabilities should handle at least 1Gbps sustained traffic

### Integration Points
- Import capabilities for PCAP files from enterprise network monitoring systems
- Integration with network configuration management databases (CMDBs)
- Export formats compatible with common enterprise ticketing and reporting systems
- APIs for integration with network management platforms and monitoring dashboards

### Key Constraints
- All analysis must be possible offline without external service dependencies
- Must support analysis of partial captures from distributed collection points
- Must handle enterprise encryption scenarios including SSL inspection where legally permitted
- Must support the wide variety of protocols found in enterprise environments (legacy to modern)

## Core Functionality
The Enterprise Network Administration version of NetScope must provide comprehensive analysis capabilities focused on managing complex network environments. The system should enable administrators to validate network segmentation, understand service dependencies, monitor bandwidth utilization patterns, identify configuration issues, and verify QoS implementation.

Key functional components include:
- VLAN and network segmentation analysis framework
- Service discovery and dependency mapping system
- Traffic classification and utilization analysis
- Configuration issue detection algorithms
- QoS implementation verification tools

The system should provide both detailed technical analysis for troubleshooting and summary reports suitable for communicating with management and other IT teams. All components should be designed to handle the scale and complexity of enterprise network environments while providing actionable insights for network optimization.

## Testing Requirements
