# NetScope - Network Threat Detection and Forensic Analysis Tool

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer focused on rapidly identifying and analyzing malicious traffic patterns, reconstructing attack timelines, and extracting actionable threat intelligence for cybersecurity incident response teams.

## Persona Description
Elena works on a cybersecurity incident response team handling active network intrusions. She needs to quickly analyze suspicious network traffic patterns to identify attack vectors, contain breaches, and gather forensic evidence for investigations.

## Key Requirements
1. **Attack pattern recognition matching traffic against known exploit signatures and tactics**
   - Implement a signature matching engine that can identify traffic patterns associated with common attack techniques (e.g., port scanning, lateral movement, data exfiltration)
   - Include capability to import, update, and customize attack signature databases
   - Provide confidence scoring to help prioritize alerts based on the likelihood of a true positive

2. **Forensic timeline reconstruction showing the progression of suspicious network activities**
   - Develop a mechanism to correlate related network events across time to build attack narratives
   - Create visualization capabilities that present events chronologically with causal relationships
   - Include session tracking across multiple protocols to follow attacker movements

3. **Malware command-and-control detection identifying beaconing and exfiltration patterns**
   - Implement statistical analysis to detect periodic communication patterns typical of C2 beaconing
   - Add capabilities to identify anomalous data transfer patterns that may indicate exfiltration
   - Include detection of common obfuscation techniques used to hide malicious traffic

4. **IoC (Indicators of Compromise) extraction generating shareable threat intelligence**
   - Create functionality to automatically extract potential IoCs (IP addresses, domains, file hashes)
   - Implement export capabilities in standard threat intelligence formats (STIX, TAXII, CSV)
   - Include contextual information with each IoC to enhance its intelligence value

5. **Incident containment assistance with targeted blocking recommendations for specific traffic**
   - Develop algorithms to identify the minimum set of traffic blocking rules needed to contain an incident
   - Generate configuration snippets for common firewalls and security appliances
   - Include risk assessment for proposed blocks to avoid disrupting critical business operations

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
  - Modules should support mocking of network interfaces for reproducible testing
  - Include performance benchmarks to ensure analysis speed meets incident response needs
  - Support replay of packet capture files for consistent testing across environments

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Process and analyze at least 10,000 packets per second on standard hardware
  - Complete initial threat scanning of a 1GB packet capture in under 60 seconds
  - Support real-time monitoring with minimal impact on network performance
  - Handle packet captures of at least 10GB in size without memory exhaustion

- **Integration Points**
  - Integration with packet capture libraries (e.g., libpcap) for live traffic analysis
  - API endpoints for receiving data from security information and event management (SIEM) systems
  - Export interfaces compatible with common threat intelligence platforms
  - Command-line interface for integration with automation scripts and other security tools

- **Key Constraints**
  - Implementation must be in Python with minimal external dependencies
  - All analysis must function with only packet data (no endpoint agents required)
  - Solution must work offline without requiring cloud or external services
  - Analysis engine must be separate from any visualization components
  - No user interface components should be implemented; focus solely on API and library functionality

## Core Functionality
The core functionality includes packet capture and parsing (supporting both live capture and pcap files), protocol decoding with focus on identifying malicious patterns, traffic analysis using both signature-based and behavioral detection methods, traffic timeline reconstruction, automatic IoC extraction, and generation of actionable containment recommendations.

The system must process network packets at various OSI layers, identifying protocols automatically and applying appropriate decoders. It should maintain contextual information across multiple packets to track sessions and detect multi-stage attacks. The analysis engine should prioritize threats based on severity, confidence, and potential impact.

The implementation should support modular extension of its capabilities through plugin interfaces for new protocol decoders, detection algorithms, and export formats. All detection capabilities should include detailed context explaining why traffic was flagged as suspicious.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accurate protocol identification and decoding across standard protocols
  - Correct signature matching against known attack patterns
  - Effective detection of anomalous traffic patterns
  - Accurate reconstruction of network sessions and event timelines
  - Reliable extraction of indicators of compromise
  - Generation of effective containment recommendations

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Analyzing a packet capture containing signs of data exfiltration
  - Identifying lateral movement attempts within a network
  - Detecting and analyzing command-and-control traffic
  - Reconstructing the timeline of a multi-stage attack
  - Extracting and exporting actionable threat intelligence

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Packet processing rate of at least 10,000 packets per second
  - Memory usage remains stable during extended analysis sessions
  - Time to first detection under 10 seconds for common attack patterns
  - Timeline reconstruction completes in under 30 seconds for 1 hour of traffic data

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Handling malformed packets and protocol violations
  - Graceful degradation when faced with encrypted traffic
  - Managing gaps in packet capture data
  - Dealing with spoofed or obfuscated traffic
  - Processing unusual or custom protocols

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for core analysis components
  - 100% coverage of public APIs
  - All error handling paths must be verified
  - Test cases must include both true positive and true negative scenarios for each detection type

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It accurately identifies at least 90% of common network-based attacks in standard test datasets
2. False positive rates remain below 5% with default configuration
3. It processes network traffic at the specified performance targets
4. Timeline reconstruction correctly identifies the sequence and relationships between attack components
5. Extracted IoCs match manually identified indicators at least 95% of the time
6. Containment recommendations effectively isolate malicious traffic with minimal impact on legitimate operations
7. All functionality is accessible programmatically through well-documented APIs
8. All tests pass consistently across different environments
