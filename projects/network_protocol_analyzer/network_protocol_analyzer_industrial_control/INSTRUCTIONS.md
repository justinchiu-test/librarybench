# ICS Protocol Analyzer for Industrial Control Networks

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer tailored for industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA environments. This tool focuses on decoding proprietary industrial protocols, monitoring safety parameters, detecting timing anomalies, verifying network segregation, and identifying deviations from established baselines to ensure the security and operational integrity of critical infrastructure.

## Persona Description
Hannah monitors network traffic for industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA environments. She needs to ensure these critical systems remain secure while identifying potential safety issues in their communication patterns.

## Key Requirements
1. **Industrial Protocol Decoders for Specialized Formats**
   - Implement protocol decoders for industrial standards including Modbus, DNP3, BACnet, Profinet, and EtherNet/IP
   - Critical for Hannah because industrial systems use specialized protocols that general-purpose analyzers often cannot interpret, preventing effective monitoring of control commands and states

2. **Safety Boundary Monitoring**
   - Create system to verify control commands and responses stay within predefined operational safety limits
   - Essential for Hannah's role in ensuring that network commands do not trigger unsafe conditions in physical industrial processes, which could lead to equipment damage or safety incidents

3. **Timing Anomaly Detection**
   - Develop analytics to identify deviations from expected communication timing patterns in real-time operations
   - Vital for industrial environments where precise timing is critical, as latency or irregular communication patterns can indicate cyberattacks or equipment failures affecting system safety

4. **Air-Gap Verification**
   - Implement network isolation verification to confirm proper segregation between IT networks and Operational Technology (OT) networks
   - Necessary for Hannah to ensure defensive architecture is functioning correctly, as improper segmentation is a primary attack vector for industrial system breaches

5. **Baseline Deviation Alerting**
   - Create a system to establish normal communication patterns and alert when industrial systems deviate from expected behavior
   - Critical for early detection of potential intrusions or system malfunctions before they can impact industrial operations

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Each protocol decoder must be independently testable with sample packet captures
  - Timing analysis functions must be verifiable using simulated traffic patterns with known anomalies
  - All alert conditions must be testable without requiring actual industrial hardware

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Protocol decoders must process packets at line rate for typical industrial networks (100Mbps)
  - Baseline analysis must complete within 5 seconds for 10,000 packet samples
  - Alert generation must occur within 500ms of detecting a triggering condition

- **Integration Points**
  - Library must expose APIs for integration with existing SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems
  - Protocol decoders should provide a consistent interface for both standard and proprietary protocols
  - System should support packet capture integration from standard formats (PCAP, PCAPNG)

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must operate in read-only mode to avoid any risk of sending commands to industrial systems
  - Cannot rely on cloud connectivity as many industrial environments are air-gapped
  - Must handle partial or malformed packets without crashing, as industrial networks often have transmission issues

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a comprehensive library for industrial network protocol analysis with the following components:

1. **Protocol Decoder Framework**
   - Extensible architecture for decoding industrial protocols
   - Built-in decoders for Modbus, DNP3, BACnet, Profinet, and EtherNet/IP
   - Protocol validation against specifications and best practices

2. **Safety Parameter Monitoring**
   - Configuration system for defining safe operational boundaries for various command types
   - Real-time validation of commands and responses against these boundaries
   - Detailed logging of boundary violations with severity classification

3. **Timing Analysis Engine**
   - Baseline establishment for expected communication patterns and timing
   - Statistical analysis to detect jitter, latency, and unexpected timing changes
   - Correlation of timing anomalies with potential causes (cyber attacks vs. system issues)

4. **Network Segmentation Verification**
   - Traffic analysis to detect communications crossing defined network boundaries
   - Verification of proper firewall and routing configurations
   - Documentation of legitimate cross-boundary communications vs. potential violations

5. **Behavioral Baseline System**
   - Machine learning algorithms to establish normal communication patterns
   - Anomaly detection based on protocol characteristics, timing, endpoints, and payload patterns
   - Configurable alerting thresholds with prioritization based on potential impact

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Protocol decoders correctly interpret all fields for each supported industrial protocol
  - Safety boundary monitoring correctly identifies and logs out-of-bounds values
  - Timing anomaly detection accurately flags deviations from established patterns
  - Network segmentation verification correctly identifies traffic crossing defined boundaries
  - Baseline deviation alerting properly detects and categorizes abnormal behavior

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Analysis of control system communications during normal operations
  - Detection of unsafe control commands that could harm physical equipment
  - Identification of potential intrusions attempting to manipulate industrial processes
  - Verification of proper network segmentation during configuration changes
  - Alerting on unexpected behavior changes in established industrial systems

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Process at least 10,000 packets per second on standard hardware
  - Complete baseline analysis of 1 million packets in under 30 seconds
  - Generate alerts within 500ms of detecting triggering conditions
  - Support concurrent analysis of at least 50 different industrial protocol streams
  - Maintain memory usage below 500MB during continuous operation

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Graceful handling of malformed industrial protocol packets
  - Proper operation with partial captures or interrupted packet streams
  - Accurate analysis during protocol version transitions or mixed-version environments
  - Correct handling of proprietary protocol extensions within standard formats
  - Robust operation during network storms or DoS conditions

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage of protocol parsing functions
  - 100% coverage of safety boundary validation logic
  - Comprehensive test cases for all supported industrial protocols
  - Performance tests must verify all specified benchmarks

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully decodes and validates 100% of test packets for all five key industrial protocols
2. Accurately detects 95%+ of safety boundary violations in simulated test data
3. Identifies timing anomalies with at least 90% precision and 85% recall
