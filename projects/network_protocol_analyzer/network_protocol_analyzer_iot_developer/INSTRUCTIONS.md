# NetScope - IoT Protocol Optimization Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer designed for IoT device firmware developers to optimize network communications for bandwidth efficiency, power conservation, and protocol compliance in resource-constrained environments.

## Persona Description
Raj develops firmware for Internet of Things devices with severe bandwidth and power constraints. He needs to optimize network communications by analyzing protocol efficiency and identifying unnecessary overhead in device communications.

## Key Requirements
1. **Protocol efficiency scoring comparing different implementation options against bandwidth usage**
   - Develop a scoring system that quantifies protocol efficiency based on header-to-payload ratios
   - Implement comparative analysis between different protocol implementations (e.g., MQTT vs. CoAP vs. custom protocols)
   - Include optimization suggestions that identify unnecessary protocol features that can be streamlined

2. **Power consumption estimation correlating network activities with energy requirements**
   - Create models that estimate energy usage based on packet size, frequency, and transmission duration
   - Provide analytics that identify power-intensive communication patterns
   - Include recommendations for optimizing transmission schedules to minimize power consumption through batching and other techniques

3. **Packet fragmentation analysis identifying issues with MTU sizing and reassembly**
   - Implement detection of fragmented packets and inefficient fragmentation patterns
   - Provide insights into optimal MTU sizes for different network environments
   - Include analysis of reassembly overhead and potential failure points in fragmentation handling

4. **Timing visualization showing communication delays and synchronization issues**
   - Develop timing analysis tools that measure and visualize response times and communication patterns
   - Implement detection of timing anomalies, jitter, and irregular periodicities
   - Include correlation between network conditions and timing variations

5. **Custom lightweight protocol validation ensuring compliance with self-defined specifications**
   - Create tools for defining and validating custom protocol specifications
   - Implement conformance testing against protocol definitions
   - Include analysis of protocol version compatibility and transition handling

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have comprehensive unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
  - Include simulation capabilities for testing against various network conditions
  - Support artificial packet generation for protocol testing
  - Implement reproducible benchmark tests for performance comparisons

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Process and analyze packet captures from up to 100 IoT devices simultaneously
  - Complete efficiency analysis of 24 hours of device traffic in under 5 minutes
  - Generate power consumption estimates with accuracy within 10% of actual measurements
  - Support real-time protocol validation during device testing

- **Integration Points**
  - Integration with packet capture libraries for capturing live IoT device traffic
  - API for integrating with firmware development workflows
  - Export formats compatible with common documentation and reporting tools
  - Command-line interface for integration with CI/CD pipelines and automated testing

- **Key Constraints**
  - Implementation must be in Python with minimal external dependencies
  - Analysis modules must be usable on development workstations and CI systems
  - Solution must work with both synthetic traffic and actual packet captures
  - No user interface components should be implemented; focus solely on API and library functionality
  - All functionality must be accessible programmatically through well-documented interfaces

## Core Functionality
The core functionality includes specialized protocol analysis focused on efficiency metrics, power consumption modeling, packet optimization, timing analysis, and custom protocol validation.

The system will parse network packets with particular attention to IoT-relevant protocols (MQTT, CoAP, LwM2M, custom protocols) and analyze them for efficiency across multiple dimensions. It will maintain timing information and correlate packet patterns with estimated power usage based on configurable device profiles.

The implementation should provide comparative analysis between different protocol options, identifying trade-offs between bandwidth usage, power consumption, reliability, and feature richness. It should offer concrete recommendations for optimizing protocol implementations for specific IoT use cases.

For custom protocol validation, the system should allow definition of protocol specifications in a structured format and verify that captured traffic conforms to these specifications, highlighting any deviations or areas for optimization.

  - Analysis completing within seconds for typical device traffic captures
  - Memory usage remaining below 100MB even for large capture files
  - Power estimation accuracy within 10% of measured values
  - Protocol parsing handling at least 1000 packets per second

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Handling malformed packets and protocol violations
  - Analyzing partially captured sessions
