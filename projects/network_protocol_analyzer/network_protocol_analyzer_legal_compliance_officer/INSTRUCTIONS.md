# NetScope for Legal Compliance Monitoring

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer designed for legal compliance officers, focusing on monitoring corporate networks for data protection regulation compliance, detecting sensitive information transmission, and ensuring proper encryption and boundary controls are in place.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen ensures corporate networks comply with data protection regulations and privacy laws. She needs to verify that sensitive information is properly secured and not transmitted in violation of compliance requirements.

## Key Requirements
1. **Sensitive data detection identifying personally identifiable information in network traffic**
   - Implement pattern recognition for PII (personally identifiable information) in network payloads
   - Develop detection algorithms for structured sensitive data like credit card numbers, social security numbers, and healthcare information
   - Create detection for unstructured sensitive content using NLP-based approaches
   - Include risk scoring based on volume and type of sensitive data detected
   - Support for customizable detection patterns to address organization-specific sensitive data

2. **Compliance boundary verification ensuring regulated data stays within approved systems**
   - Implement boundary definition and monitoring for regulated data zones
   - Develop detection for unauthorized transmission of sensitive data across defined boundaries
   - Create visualization of data flows with compliance boundary overlays
   - Include chain of custody tracking for sensitive data as it moves between systems
   - Support for different boundary definitions based on data classification and regulatory frameworks

3. **Encryption verification confirming appropriate protocols are used for sensitive communications**
   - Implement detection and classification of encryption protocols in network traffic
   - Develop strength assessment for observed encryption methods
   - Create compliance mapping between data types and required encryption levels
   - Include certificate validation and management verification
   - Support for encryption requirements from various regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)

4. **Data transfer geographical mapping showing cross-border information flows**
   - Implement geolocation analysis for network endpoints
   - Develop visualization of international data flows with regulatory context
   - Create detection for potentially problematic cross-border transfers
   - Include documentation generation for cross-border transfer compliance
   - Support for mapping against approved transfer mechanisms (Privacy Shield, SCCs, BCRs, etc.)

5. **Regulatory reporting assistance generating documentation for compliance audits**
   - Implement templated report generation for common regulatory frameworks
   - Develop evidence collection and organization for compliance documentation
   - Create audit trail generation with non-repudiation features
   - Include historical compliance state tracking for trend analysis
   - Support for custom reporting requirements based on specific regulatory needs

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- Sensitive data detection must be testable with synthetic datasets containing known PII patterns
- Boundary verification must be verifiable against predefined compliance zone definitions
- Encryption analysis must be testable against traffic with known encryption characteristics
- Geographical mapping must be verifiable with endpoints in known locations
- Report generation must be validated against regulatory reporting requirements

### Performance Expectations
- Analysis tools must process corporate network traffic at rates suitable for compliance monitoring
- PII scanning should handle at least 100GB of traffic per day on standard hardware
- Boundary analysis should process traffic in near real-time for active compliance monitoring
- System should scale to handle enterprise networks with thousands of endpoints
- Report generation should complete within minutes even for extensive compliance documentation

### Integration Points
- Import capabilities for PCAP files and log data from enterprise security systems
- Integration with data classification and DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems
- Export formats compatible with GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platforms
- APIs for integration with SIEM and security orchestration systems
- Support for feeding findings into ticketing and incident response workflows

### Key Constraints
- All processing must maintain chain of custody appropriate for potential legal proceedings
- Analysis must not create additional compliance risks (e.g., by copying sensitive data unnecessarily)
- Must support operation in highly regulated environments with strict data handling requirements
- Should accommodate both real-time monitoring and forensic investigation of historical traffic
- Must maintain detailed audit logs of all compliance monitoring activities

## Core Functionality
The Legal Compliance Monitoring version of NetScope must provide comprehensive analysis capabilities focused on regulatory compliance for network communications. The system should enable compliance officers to detect sensitive data transmission, verify compliance boundaries, validate encryption methods, map geographical data flows, and generate regulatory documentation.

Key functional components include:
- Sensitive data detection and classification framework
- Compliance boundary definition and monitoring system
- Encryption method validation tools
- Geographical data flow mapping and analysis
- Regulatory reporting and documentation generation

The system should balance technical depth with compliance relevance, providing both detailed evidence for specific compliance requirements and high-level summaries suitable for executive and regulatory reporting. All components should be designed with evidential integrity in mind, suitable for use in compliance processes and potential legal contexts.

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate detection of various types of sensitive data in network traffic
- Reliable identification of compliance boundary violations
- Comprehensive validation of encryption methods against regulatory requirements
- Precise mapping of geographical data flows with regulatory implications
- Compliant generation of documentation suitable for regulatory audits

### Critical User Scenarios
- Performing routine compliance monitoring of enterprise network traffic
- Investigating potential data leakage or compliance violations
- Preparing documentation for regulatory audits and certifications
- Analyzing the compliance impact of new systems or integrations
- Responding to regulatory inquiries about data handling practices

### Performance Benchmarks
- Detect at least 95% of known PII patterns in test data with false positive rate below 5%
- Process and analyze compliance boundaries for enterprise traffic (10GB) in under 30 minutes
- Validate encryption compliance for at least 1000 connections per minute
- Map geographical data flows for an enterprise environment in under 15 minutes
- Generate comprehensive regulatory reports in under 5 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Appropriate handling of encrypted sensitive data
- Correct analysis of obfuscated or encoded PII
- Graceful management of edge cases in jurisdictional determination
- Proper handling of complex multi-hop data transfers
- Accurate processing of data pseudonymization and anonymization techniques
- Appropriate handling of exceptions and authorized deviations from compliance policies

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
