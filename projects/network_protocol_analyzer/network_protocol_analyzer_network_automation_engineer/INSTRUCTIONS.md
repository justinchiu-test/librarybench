## Core Functionality
The Network Automation Verification version of NetScope must provide specialized analysis capabilities focused on validating network automation outcomes. The system should enable automation engineers to compare traffic patterns before and after changes, correlate configurations with observed behavior, verify intended network functionality, simulate failure scenarios, and integrate with automation pipelines.

Key functional components include:
- Differential traffic analysis framework
- Configuration-to-behavior correlation system
- Intent-based network verification
- Failure scenario simulation and impact prediction
