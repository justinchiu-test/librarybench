# NetScope for Security Incident Response

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analyzer optimized for cybersecurity incident response, enabling rapid analysis of suspicious traffic patterns to identify attack vectors, contain active breaches, and gather forensic evidence for security investigations.

## Persona Description
Elena works on a cybersecurity incident response team handling active network intrusions. She needs to quickly analyze suspicious network traffic patterns to identify attack vectors, contain breaches, and gather forensic evidence for investigations.

## Key Requirements
1. **Attack pattern recognition matching traffic against known exploit signatures and tactics**
   - Implement a signature-based detection system that can match captured network traffic against a database of known attack patterns and exploit signatures
   - The system must support both atomic signatures (specific byte patterns) and behavioral signatures (sequences of packets that indicate malicious activity)
   - Include capabilities to update and manage the signature database, with versioning and provenance tracking

2. **Forensic timeline reconstruction showing the progression of suspicious network activities**
   - Develop a timeline reconstruction system that can chronologically organize captured packets related to an incident
   - Implement correlation algorithms to link related activities across different protocols and connections
   - Provide functionality to annotate the timeline with analyst observations and export it in formats suitable for incident reporting

3. **Malware command-and-control detection identifying beaconing and exfiltration patterns**
   - Create detection algorithms for periodic beaconing behaviors characteristic of compromised systems
   - Implement heuristics to identify data exfiltration attempts, including unusual data transfer patterns, encoding methods, and destination anomalies
   - Support for detecting common C2 obfuscation techniques such as domain generation algorithms and traffic mimicry

4. **IoC (Indicators of Compromise) extraction generating shareable threat intelligence**
   - Develop automated extraction of network-based IoCs including suspicious IPs, domains, URLs, and unusual DNS patterns
   - Implement export capabilities in standard threat intelligence formats (STIX, TAXII, OpenIOC, etc.)
   - Include confidence scoring for extracted IoCs based on correlation with known malicious patterns

5. **Incident containment assistance with targeted blocking recommendations for specific traffic**
   - Implement analysis capabilities that can generate specific network blocking rules based on identified malicious traffic
   - Support multiple firewall and IDS/IPS rule formats (iptables, Cisco, Snort, etc.) for immediate deployment
   - Include risk assessment for recommended blocks to prevent disruption to legitimate business activities

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All detection algorithms must be testable with predefined packet capture files containing known malicious patterns
- Signature matching system must report false positive and false negative rates against test datasets
- Timeline reconstruction accuracy must be verifiable through predefined ground truth datasets
- IoC extraction precision and recall must be measurable against known IoC datasets

### Performance Expectations
- Attack pattern recognition must process at least 1000 packets per second on standard hardware
- Timeline reconstruction must handle sessions spanning at least 24 hours of continuous traffic
- Analysis operations should perform efficiently on packet captures up to 10GB in size
- Memory usage must scale linearly with traffic volume and remain under 4GB for most operations

### Integration Points
- Support for importing PCAP files from standard network capture tools
- API endpoints for receiving live packet streams from network taps or monitoring systems
- Export capabilities compatible with incident response platforms and SIEMs
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds for signature and IoC correlation

### Key Constraints
- All analysis must be possible offline without external service dependencies
- Must preserve chain of custody for forensic evidence requirements
- All operations must be logged for audit trail requirements
- Parsing of potential malicious payloads must be done in a safe, contained manner

## Core Functionality
The Security Incident Response version of NetScope must provide a comprehensive packet analysis library specifically optimized for security investigations. The system should enable rapid triage of network traffic to identify potential security incidents, provide detailed analysis tools for investigating confirmed breaches, and generate actionable intelligence for containment and remediation.

Key functional components include:
- A modular signature detection engine with support for complex pattern matching
- Timeline analysis tools with event correlation capabilities
- Statistical anomaly detection focused on potential malicious behaviors
- Automatic extraction and categorization of potential indicators of compromise
- Rule generation for network security controls to contain identified threats

The system should implement a layered analysis approach, moving from rapid triage to in-depth forensic examination as suspicious activity is confirmed. All operations should maintain evidentiary integrity and provide complete audit trails suitable for legal and compliance purposes.

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate detection of known attack patterns in both live and captured traffic
- Correct temporal ordering and causality linkage in the timeline reconstruction
- Detection of various command-and-control and data exfiltration patterns
- Extraction of valid, actionable IoCs from traffic containing security incidents
- Generation of effective blocking rules that contain threats without excessive collateral impact

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing a suspected breach to determine the initial attack vector
- Tracking lateral movement of attackers across a network
- Identifying data exfiltration during an active breach
- Generating actionable threat intelligence from an incident
- Creating emergency containment rules during an active incident

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete initial triage analysis of a 1GB PCAP file in under 5 minutes
- Process live traffic at minimum line rate for a 1Gbps network connection
- Extract IoCs from a multi-day traffic capture in under 10 minutes
- Generate blocking rules within 30 seconds of identifying malicious traffic

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Graceful handling of corrupt or incomplete packet captures
- Accurate analysis of fragmented or out-of-order packets
- Correct handling of encrypted traffic without breaking encryption
- Proper management of very large (>10GB) packet captures
- Resilience against adversarial attempts to evade detection
- Error handling for malformed packets and protocol violations

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core analysis components
- Complete coverage of all signature matching algorithms
- Tests for each supported protocol decoder
- Comprehensive tests for timeline reconstruction with complex scenarios
- Full coverage of all IoC extraction mechanisms

## Success Criteria
- Successful detection of at least 95% of MITRE ATT&CK techniques that have network observables in test traffic
- Timeline reconstruction accuracy of at least 98% when compared to ground truth data
- False positive rate below 1% for IoC extraction from realistic network traffic
- Generated blocking rules effectively contain threats in test scenarios while affecting less than 0.1% of legitimate traffic
- System demonstrates linear scaling with traffic volume, maintaining specified performance metrics
- All operations maintain complete audit trails suitable for evidentiary purposes
