# Distributed Digital Heritage Preservation Network

## Overview
A resilient peer-to-peer preservation system designed for long-term archiving of cultural heritage materials, enabling redundant storage across diverse geographical locations with built-in integrity verification, location optimization, and comprehensive metadata synchronization.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel preserves digital cultural heritage by creating distributed archives of important materials. She needs redundant, resilient storage across multiple independent locations to ensure long-term preservation.

## Key Requirements
1. **Replication Management**
   - Configurable replication factor for different preservation priorities
   - Intelligent distribution to ensure sufficient independent copies
   - Automated rebalancing when nodes join or leave
   - Critical for ensuring no single point of failure exists for irreplaceable cultural artifacts, with more important materials receiving higher replication levels

2. **Geographic Diversity Optimization**
   - Location-aware distribution of replicas
   - Physical separation requirements for critical materials
   - Geopolitical risk assessment and distribution planning
   - Essential for protecting against regional disasters, political instability, or infrastructure failures by ensuring copies exist in diverse physical locations

3. **Scheduled Integrity Verification**
   - Cryptographic fixity checking on a configurable schedule
   - Automated repair of degraded copies
   - Corruption detection and alerting system
   - Vital for detecting and addressing bit rot, storage failures, or tampering over the decades-long timespan of digital preservation

4. **Catalog Synchronization**
   - Distributed metadata catalog
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent metadata updates
   - Versioned metadata history
   - Necessary for maintaining consistent, accurate descriptive information across all preservation nodes, supporting proper discovery and management of archived materials

5. **Preservation-Specific Formats**
   - Format conversion to archival standards
   - Embedded provenance and authenticity information
   - Self-describing preservation packages
   - Critical for ensuring long-term accessibility and establishing chain of custody for digital materials, enhancing their scholarly and cultural value

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All preservation functions must have comprehensive tests
- Distributed storage behavior must be verifiable in simulated environments
- Integrity mechanisms must have 100% test coverage
- Metadata synchronization must have extensive conflict tests
- Format conversion must be validated against standards

### Performance Expectations
- Support for archives containing millions of items
- Efficient handling of individual artifacts up to 100GB
- Minimal network overhead for integrity checking
- Responsive metadata queries despite distributed nature
- Graceful operation with intermittently connected nodes

### Integration Points
- Standard archival metadata schema compatibility (MODS, Dublin Core, etc.)
- Digital preservation system APIs (Archivematica, Preservica, etc.)
- Geolocation services for node distribution
- Library catalog and discovery systems
- Long-term storage technologies (LOCKSS, tape archives)

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with heterogeneous storage infrastructure
- Must function with nodes connecting intermittently
- No single entity should control the entire preservation network
- Must accommodate extremely long-term operation (decades)
- Must have minimal external dependencies for core functionality

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must be implemented as a library with the following components:

1. **Replication Engine**
   - Copy distribution and management
   - Replication factor enforcement
   - Node availability monitoring
   - Recovery and redistribution

2. **Geographic Distribution System**
   - Location tracking and management
   - Distribution planning algorithms
   - Risk analysis framework
   - Physical separation verification

3. **Integrity Verification Framework**
   - Scheduled verification management
   - Multi-algorithm checksum implementation
   - Corruption detection and reporting
   - Automated repair mechanisms

4. **Metadata Management System**
   - Distributed catalog implementation
   - Schema validation and enforcement
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Version history tracking

5. **Preservation Package Processor**
   - Format conversion to archival standards
   - Provenance tracking and embedding
   - Self-containment packaging
   - Long-term access provision

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Proper replication according to preservation policies
- Geographic distribution meeting separation requirements
- Accurate detection and repair of data corruption
- Consistent metadata synchronization despite conflicts
- Correct creation of standards-compliant preservation packages

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Network operation with fluctuating node availability
- Geographic distribution with simulated regional failures
- Integrity verification with various corruption patterns
- Metadata synchronization with concurrent updates
- Format conversion with diverse input materials

### Performance Benchmarks
- Replication speed vs. available network bandwidth
- Geographic optimization quality vs. computational time
- Fixity checking overhead as percentage of storage size
- Metadata query response time despite distribution
- Package processing throughput for various formats

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Severe node unavailability across the network
- Geographic limitations when few diverse locations exist
- Recovery from widespread integrity failures
- Resolution of complex metadata conflicts
- Handling of unrecognized or problematic formats
- Extremely large or complex preservation items

### Required Test Coverage
- 100% coverage of replication management code
- ≥95% coverage for geographic distribution components
- 100% coverage for integrity verification mechanisms
- ≥90% coverage for metadata synchronization
- ≥95% coverage for preservation package processing

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Digital artifacts consistently maintain the specified minimum number of copies
2. Copies are distributed to minimize geographic and geopolitical risks
3. Data integrity is regularly verified and automatically repaired when needed
4. Metadata remains consistent and accurate across all preservation nodes
5. Artifacts are stored in formats optimized for long-term access and authenticity
6. All five key requirements are fully implemented and testable via pytest
7. The system provides greater preservation security than centralized alternatives
8. Preserved materials remain accessible and verifiable over extended time periods

To set up the development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
