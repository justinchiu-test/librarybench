# ArchiveNet - A Distributed Preservation System for Digital Cultural Heritage

## Overview
ArchiveNet is a specialized peer-to-peer preservation system designed for creating resilient, distributed archives of important digital cultural heritage materials. It implements redundant storage across multiple independent locations with geographic diversity, regular integrity verification, synchronized metadata catalogs, and preservation-specific formats to ensure the long-term accessibility and authenticity of digital artifacts.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel preserves digital cultural heritage by creating distributed archives of important materials. She needs redundant, resilient storage across multiple independent locations to ensure long-term preservation.

## Key Requirements
1. **Replication Management System**
   - Intelligent distribution ensuring sufficient copies exist across the network
   - Critical for Dr. Patel because digital preservation requires multiple redundant copies to guard against data loss, with the system automatically maintaining the specified minimum number of replicas for each artifact
   - Must include configurable replication policies, automated copy distribution, health monitoring of replicas, and recovery mechanisms when copies are lost

2. **Geographic Diversity Optimization**
   - Strategic distribution spreading data across different physical locations
   - Essential for true preservation resilience as geographic separation prevents catastrophic loss from regional disasters or institutional failures, ensuring that no single event can destroy all copies
   - Implementation should include location awareness, diversity algorithms, distance-based placement, and geographic risk analysis

3. **Integrity Verification Framework**
   - Scheduled validation of stored artifacts against cryptographic checksums
   - Vital because silent corruption is a major threat to long-term preservation - regular verification detects problems early before they affect all copies, allowing for timely intervention
   - Requires cryptographic hash verification, fixity checking schedules, corruption alerting, and automatic repair from valid copies

4. **Catalog Synchronization System**
   - Distributed metadata maintenance ensuring consistency across all archive nodes
   - Important because accurate, consistent descriptive metadata is essential for finding and understanding preserved materials across the distributed network, preventing "dark archives" where content exists but cannot be located
   - Should include schema validation, conflict resolution, distributed updates, and version history

5. **Preservation-Specific Formats**
   - Specialized packaging with built-in provenance and authenticity information
   - Critical for maintaining the context, authenticity, and usability of materials over long timeframes, binding together content, metadata, and preservation history in self-describing packages
   - Must support standardized preservation formats, migration pathways, integrity evidence, and chain of custody documentation

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Simulation of diverse geographic node distribution
  - Accelerated time testing for long-term integrity verification
  - Validation suite for metadata synchronization accuracy
  - Tests for recovery from simulated data corruption
  - Verification of preservation format compliance with standards

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Support for individual artifacts up to 100GB
  - Collective archive capacity scaling to petabyte range
  - Integrity verification processing at least 1TB per day per node
  - Catalog operations responding within 3 seconds even with millions of items
  - Distribution intelligence optimizing for both preservation security and access efficiency

- **Integration Points**
  - Standard preservation metadata formats (PREMIS, METS)
  - Common archival information packages (BagIt, OCFL)
  - Digital repository systems and catalogs
  - Persistent identifier systems
  - International preservation networks and standards

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must maintain integrity over decades-long timeframes
  - Must operate across organizations with different technical infrastructures
  - Must comply with digital preservation best practices and standards
  - Must function with varying levels of connectivity between nodes
  - Must handle the diversity of digital formats in cultural heritage collections

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
ArchiveNet must provide a comprehensive solution for distributed digital preservation with these core components:

1. A robust peer-to-peer replication system that maintains multiple copies based on configurable policies
2. A geographic distribution engine that strategically places copies to maximize disaster resilience
3. An integrity monitoring system that regularly verifies all stored artifacts against checksums
4. A metadata synchronization mechanism that maintains consistent catalogs across all nodes
5. A preservation packaging system that implements standards-compliant archival formats
6. A provenance tracking system that documents the complete history of each preserved item
7. A network monitoring system that verifies the overall health of the preservation network
8. A recovery mechanism that can reconstruct damaged artifacts from intact copies

The system should provide well-defined APIs that can integrate with existing digital preservation workflows and repository systems, with clear programmatic access to all features and compliance with relevant standards.

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive test suites verifying:

- **Key Functionalities**
  - Validation of replication policies ensuring minimum copy requirements
  - Verification of geographic distribution meeting diversity requirements
  - Confirmation of integrity checking identifying and repairing corruption
  - Validation of catalog synchronization maintaining consistency
  - Verification of preservation format compliance with standards

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - A cultural institution adding new artifacts to the distributed preservation network
  - The system automatically distributing copies with appropriate geographic separation
  - Regular integrity verification detecting and reporting anomalies
  - Catalog updates propagating correctly across all participating nodes
  - Recovery of an artifact when one storage location experiences data loss

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Replication completion within specified timeframes based on artifact size
  - Geographic distribution algorithms achieving optimal placement in >95% of cases
  - Integrity verification processing at minimum 1TB/day per standard node
  - Catalog synchronization completing within 10 minutes even for large updates
  - Preservation packaging overhead not exceeding 10% of artifact size

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Recovery from simultaneous loss of multiple copies
  - Handling of network partitions between archive nodes
  - Resolution of conflicting metadata updates
  - Management of extremely large or complex artifacts
  - Graceful degradation when facing resource constraints

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% statement coverage for all modules
  - Extensive testing of data integrity protection mechanisms
  - Long-running tests simulating preservation over time
  - Chaos testing with random node failures and network partitions
  - Compliance testing against relevant preservation standards

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Digital artifacts are consistently maintained with the specified number of distributed copies
2. Geographic diversity algorithms place copies to maximize disaster resilience
3. Regular integrity verification detects and addresses corruption or loss promptly
4. Metadata catalogs remain synchronized and accurate across all participating nodes
5. Preservation-specific formats properly maintain provenance and authenticity information
6. The system demonstrably complies with digital preservation best practices and standards
7. All preservation operations are fully documented for audit and transparency
8. The solution can be integrated with existing digital repository systems
