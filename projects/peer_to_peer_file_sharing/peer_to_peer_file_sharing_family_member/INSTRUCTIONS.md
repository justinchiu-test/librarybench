# Private Family Media Sharing Network

## Overview
A privacy-focused peer-to-peer system designed specifically for sharing family photos, videos, and memories between relatives without uploading personal content to commercial cloud services, featuring simple discovery, closed-network operation, and media-specific optimizations.

## Persona Description
Miguel wants to share photos and videos with family members without uploading personal memories to commercial cloud services. He needs an easy-to-use, private sharing network accessible to non-technical relatives.

## Key Requirements
1. **Simplified Technical Interface**
   - Programmatic abstraction hiding P2P complexity
   - Simple API design focused on common family sharing scenarios
   - Clear error reporting and recovery mechanisms
   - Essential for enabling integration with user-friendly applications that can be used by family members of all technical skill levels, from teenagers to grandparents

2. **Automatic Family Device Discovery**
   - Zero-configuration local network discovery
   - Persistent device recognition across sessions
   - QR code-based remote device authentication
   - Critical for eliminating complex setup procedures, making it effortless for family members to find each other's devices whether on the same home network or connecting remotely

3. **Closed Network Security**
   - Family group creation and management
   - Cryptographic verification of member devices
   - Strict limitation to explicitly trusted devices
   - Vital for ensuring that personal family memories remain strictly within the defined family circle, providing privacy from both commercial services and unauthorized access

4. **Media-Specific Optimizations**
   - Automatic transcoding for device compatibility
   - Resolution adaptation based on viewing device
   - Preview generation for efficient browsing
   - Necessary for handling the wide variety of family devices (from smartphones to smart TVs) while ensuring optimal viewing experience and efficient use of storage and bandwidth

5. **Family Album Organization**
   - Hierarchical collection management
   - Chronological and event-based organization
   - Tag-based categorization and search
   - Critical for preserving the context and structure of family memories, maintaining familiar photo album concepts that make navigation intuitive for non-technical users

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All APIs must have comprehensive interface tests
- Discovery mechanisms must be testable in simulated networks
- Security components must have thorough vulnerability testing
- Media processing must be validated for various formats
- Organization functions must verify data consistency

### Performance Expectations
- Support for libraries containing 100,000+ media items
- Efficient handling of videos up to 4K resolution
- Discovery of new devices within 5 seconds on local networks
- Transfer speeds utilizing at least 80% of available bandwidth
- Responsive browsing even with large media collections

### Integration Points
- Common media format support (.jpg, .png, .mp4, .mov, etc.)
- Standard metadata extraction (EXIF, XMP)
- Cross-platform operation for diverse family devices
- Local network protocols (mDNS, UPnP)
- Backup solution compatibility

### Key Constraints
- No external service dependencies for core functionality
- No data sharing with third parties under any circumstances
- Minimal resource usage on mobile devices
- Offline operation capability
- Support for non-technical users through simplified APIs

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must be implemented as a library with the following components:

1. **Simplified API Layer**
   - High-level function abstraction
   - Common use-case optimization
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Progressive complexity for advanced needs

2. **Family Device Management**
   - Network discovery implementation
   - Device registration and authentication
   - Persistent identity management
   - Connection maintenance

3. **Privacy-First Security**
   - Closed group enforcement
   - End-to-end encryption implementation
   - Trust chain verification
   - Access control management

4. **Media Processing Engine**
   - Format detection and handling
   - Transcoding and adaptation
   - Preview generation
   - Metadata preservation

5. **Collection Organization System**
   - Album and collection management
   - Chronological and event organization
   - Tagging and categorization
   - Search functionality

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Ease of use through simplified API
- Reliable discovery of family devices
- Proper enforcement of closed network security
- Correct media processing for various formats and devices
- Effective organization of family media collections

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Family sharing across different network environments
- Device discovery and authentication in various scenarios
- Security against unauthorized access attempts
- Media handling for diverse formats and sizes
- Organization of typical family media collections

### Performance Benchmarks
- API simplicity measured by function count and parameters
- Discovery time across local and remote networks
- Security verification overhead (minimal impact)
- Transcoding speed and quality for standard formats
- Collection navigation responsiveness with large libraries

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network transitions during media transfer
- Recovery from interrupted sharing operations
- Handling of unusual or corrupted media files
- Operation with limited storage space
- Recovery from authentication failures
- Cross-platform compatibility edge cases

### Required Test Coverage
- ≥95% coverage for simplified API layer
- ≥90% coverage for device discovery components
- 100% coverage for security-critical code
- ≥90% coverage for media processing engine
- ≥85% coverage for collection organization system

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Family members of all technical skill levels can participate through simple integration
2. Devices automatically discover and recognize other family members
3. Family memories remain strictly within the authorized family circle
4. Media appears correctly on all family devices regardless of format differences
5. Collections maintain familiar organization patterns from traditional photo albums
6. All five key requirements are fully implemented and testable via pytest
7. The system provides a viable alternative to commercial cloud services for family sharing
8. Family members report increased comfort sharing personal memories through the system

To set up the development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
