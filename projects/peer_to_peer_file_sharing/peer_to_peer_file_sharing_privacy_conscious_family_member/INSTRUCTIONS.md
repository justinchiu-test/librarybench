# FamilyShare - A Private P2P File Sharing System for Personal Memories

## Overview
FamilyShare is a private peer-to-peer file sharing system designed for families to share personal photos and videos without using commercial cloud services. It focuses on simplicity, automatic discovery of family devices, closed network operation, and media-specific optimizations to create a secure and easy-to-use sharing network for preserving precious family memories.

## Persona Description
Miguel wants to share photos and videos with family members without uploading personal memories to commercial cloud services. He needs an easy-to-use, private sharing network accessible to non-technical relatives.

## Key Requirements
1. **Simple Technical Interface**
   - Abstraction layer hiding complex P2P mechanics from casual users
   - Critical for Miguel's family as many members have limited technical skills and would be deterred by complicated interfaces - the system must make sharing as effortless as possible while maintaining privacy
   - Must include intuitive programmatic APIs, clear error messages, automated operation where possible, and minimal configuration requirements

2. **Automatic Device Discovery**
   - Zero-configuration networking to find family members on the same network
   - Essential for reducing technical barriers, allowing family devices to recognize each other automatically when on the same home network without requiring complex setup procedures or manual connection information
   - Implementation should include local network scanning, device identification, service advertising, and seamless connection establishment

3. **Closed Network Operation**
   - Strict security limiting sharing to explicitly trusted devices
   - Vital for Miguel's privacy concerns because he wants family memories to remain strictly within the family circle, ensuring that media cannot accidentally be exposed to unintended recipients
   - Requires strong device authentication, trust establishment protocols, access control enforcement, and verification of network boundaries

4. **Media-Specific Optimizations**
   - Specialized handling including automatic transcoding for different devices
   - Important because family members use various devices (phones, tablets, computers, smart TVs) with different capabilities and storage constraints - the system needs to ensure optimal viewing experience on each device
   - Should include format detection, dynamic transcoding, resolution adaptation, and metadata preservation

5. **Album Organization System**
   - Familiar categorization preserving intuitive ways of browsing family memories
   - Critical for user experience as family members expect to browse shared memories in familiar ways similar to standard photo apps, making the transition from commercial services comfortable and intuitive
   - Must support hierarchical albums, event grouping, date-based organization, tag-based filtering, and custom collections

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Simulation of mixed-device family networks
  - Testing across different media types and formats
  - Validation of privacy boundaries and access controls
  - Verification of discovery mechanisms under various network conditions
  - Usability validation through programmatic API assessment

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Fast local device discovery (under 5 seconds on standard home networks)
  - Support for family media collections up to 1TB
  - Transcoding completing within reasonable timeframes (< 2 minutes for typical videos)
  - Responsive browsing experience even with large collections
  - Minimal resource usage on mobile devices to preserve battery life

- **Integration Points**
  - Common media formats (JPEG, HEIF, PNG, MP4, MOV, etc.)
  - Standard metadata formats (EXIF, XMP)
  - Various device operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)
  - Local network protocols (mDNS, Bonjour, SSDP)
  - Existing media organization standards

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must operate without any external cloud services
  - Must prioritize privacy and data sovereignty
  - Must function with minimal technical knowledge
  - Must handle intermittent connectivity between family devices
  - Must support typical home network environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
FamilyShare must provide a comprehensive private media sharing solution with these core components:

1. A simplified P2P architecture designed for ease of use with minimal technical requirements
2. An automatic discovery system that finds and connects family devices on local networks
3. A strong authentication and access control system limiting sharing to trusted devices only
4. A media handling engine with format conversion optimized for different viewing devices
5. An organization system that maintains familiar album structures and browsing patterns
6. A synchronization mechanism that keeps shared content updated across family devices
7. A metadata management system preserving important information about shared memories
8. An efficient transfer protocol optimized for media files and home network environments

The system should provide clean, simple APIs that could be integrated into family-friendly applications, with a focus on privacy, simplicity, and reliability rather than advanced features or maximum performance.

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive test suites verifying:

- **Key Functionalities**
  - Validation of simplified programmatic interfaces for non-technical users
  - Verification of automatic device discovery and connection
  - Confirmation of closed network security boundaries
  - Validation of media transcoding quality and compatibility
  - Verification of album organization and browsing structures

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - A family setting up a private sharing network for the first time
  - Automatic discovery and connection of a new family device
  - Sharing family vacation photos with relatives on various devices
  - Browsing and viewing shared memories across different device types
  - Maintaining privacy when guests connect to the home network

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Device discovery completing within 5 seconds on typical home networks
  - Media transfers utilizing at least 80% of available local network bandwidth
  - Album browsing operations responding within 1 second even with large collections
  - Transcoding performance within specified timeframes for common media types
  - System resource usage remaining below defined thresholds on mobile devices

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Recovery from interrupted transfers during device disconnection
  - Handling of unusual or corrupt media file formats
  - Management of extremely large family archives
  - Operation across complex home network configurations
  - Behavior when unauthorized access is attempted

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% statement coverage for all modules
  - Specific privacy and security testing for all data exchanges
  - Performance testing under various home network conditions
  - Compatibility testing with common media formats and types
  - Usability testing of programmatic APIs for integration

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Family members can easily share media without technical complexity
2. Devices automatically discover and connect when on the same network
3. Shared content remains strictly within the authorized family circle
4. Media displays optimally on each family member's device
5. Photos and videos are organized in familiar, intuitive ways
6. The system operates reliably in typical home environments
7. Privacy is maintained without reliance on external services
8. The solution provides a viable alternative to commercial cloud sharing
