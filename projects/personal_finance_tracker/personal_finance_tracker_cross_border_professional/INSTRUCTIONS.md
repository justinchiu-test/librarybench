# Multi-Currency International Finance Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive financial management system designed for professionals working across international borders who need to track finances in multiple currencies, manage complex international tax obligations, monitor accounts in different countries, and optimize financial decisions across national boundaries.

## Persona Description
Priya works internationally and deals with multiple currencies, international tax obligations, and financial accounts in different countries. She needs to track assets and liabilities across national boundaries while optimizing for complex international tax situations.

## Key Requirements
1. **Multi-currency support with historical exchange rate tracking and conversion**
   - Support for tracking accounts and transactions in multiple currencies
   - Historical exchange rate data storage and retrieval
   - Real-time and user-defined exchange rate application
   - Currency gain/loss calculation and tracking
   - Critical for maintaining an accurate picture of finances spread across different currencies and understanding the impact of currency fluctuations on overall wealth

2. **Country-specific tax rule application for different income streams**
   - Support for multiple tax jurisdictions simultaneously
   - Income source categorization by country of origin
   - Tax treaty benefit application and tracking
   - Foreign tax credit calculation and optimization

3. **Foreign account reporting compliance for tax requirements like FBAR or FATCA**
   - Tracking of foreign account balances for reporting thresholds
   - Documentation of account information required for compliance
   - Record-keeping for historical account values on reporting dates
   - Automated report generation for common foreign account disclosures
   - Necessary for meeting complex international reporting requirements and avoiding substantial penalties for non-compliance

4. **International cost-of-living adjustments when moving between assignments**
   - Cost of living indexing for different locations
   - Budget adaptation when relocating internationally
   - Purchasing power parity calculations
   - Expense normalization across different economies
   - Vital for understanding the real impact of expenses and income in different locations and making appropriate financial decisions during transitions

5. **Remittance optimization identifying the most cost-effective ways to move money internationally**
   - Comparison of money transfer methods and costs
   - Timing optimization for currency exchanges
   - Fee and spread tracking for international transfers
   - Historical analysis of transfer costs and savings
   - Important for minimizing the substantial costs associated with moving money across borders and between currencies

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - Currency conversion calculations must be deterministic and unit-testable
  - Tax calculations must be verifiable against known international tax scenarios
  - Exchange rate applications must be testable with historical rate data
  - Reporting threshold monitoring must be verifiable for compliance testing
  - Transfer optimization algorithms must demonstrate cost savings

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Support for high-volume transaction history in multiple currencies
  - Fast recalculation when exchange rates or tax rules change
  - Efficient handling of complex tax calculations across jurisdictions
  - Quick comparison of money transfer alternatives
  - Responsive operation even with accounts in many countries

- **Integration Points**
  - Import capabilities for bank and financial institution data worldwide
  - Access to historical and current exchange rate data
  - Country-specific tax rule databases
  - Cost of living index information
  - Money transfer service rate information

- **Key Constraints**
  - High accuracy requirements for currency conversion (4+ decimal places)
  - Clear identification of assumptions in tax calculations
  - Transparent methodology for all cost comparisons
  - Regular updates to reflect changing regulations
  - Proper handling of timezone differences for transaction timing

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide these core components:

1. **Multi-Currency Account Management**
   - Account creation in any currency
   - Currency-aware transaction recording
   - Balance calculation with exchange rate application
   - Currency gain/loss tracking and analysis

2. **International Tax Management**
   - Multi-jurisdiction tax tracking
   - Income source and type categorization
   - Foreign tax credit optimization
   - Tax treaty benefit application

3. **Compliance Reporting**
   - Foreign account balance monitoring
   - Reporting threshold alerts
   - Historical record maintenance
   - Report generation for tax authorities

4. **Global Cost of Living Analysis**
   - Location-based cost indexing
   - Budget adjustment for relocations
   - Expense normalization across countries
   - Purchasing power comparison

5. **International Money Movement**
   - Transfer method comparison
   - Fee and exchange rate tracking
   - Timing optimization suggestions
   - Transfer history and cost analysis

6. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Consolidated net worth across currencies
   - Currency exposure visualization
   - Tax efficiency metrics
   - International financial performance analysis
   - Location-based financial comparisons

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities for Verification**
  - Accuracy of multi-currency calculations and conversions
  - Correct application of international tax rules
  - Proper identification of reportable foreign accounts
  - Precision of cost-of-living adjustments
  - Effective optimization of international money transfers

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Managing accounts and transactions across multiple currencies
  - Calculating tax obligations in several countries simultaneously
  - Tracking foreign accounts for reporting compliance
  - Adjusting budgets when relocating internationally
  - Comparing options for transferring money between countries

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Support for at least 10 different currencies simultaneously
  - Calculation of tax implications across 5+ jurisdictions in under 10 seconds
  - Generation of complete foreign account reports in under 5 seconds
  - Cost of living comparison between 10+ locations in under 3 seconds
  - Analysis of 20+ money transfer options in under 5 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Handling of currencies with extreme exchange rate volatility
  - Management of countries with complex or unusual tax treaties
  - Adaptation to retroactive tax law changes
  - Recovery from incomplete exchange rate data
  - Proper handling of accounts in countries with currency controls
  - Graceful management of conflicting tax rules across jurisdictions

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for currency conversion and tax calculation functions
  - Comprehensive test suite for compliance reporting logic
  - Thorough validation of cost-of-living adjustment calculations
  - Complete testing of money transfer optimization algorithms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Currency conversions match expected results with precision to 4 decimal places
- Tax calculations align with tax treaty provisions and country-specific rules
- Foreign account reporting correctly identifies accounts meeting thresholds
- Cost-of-living adjustments accurately reflect location-based differences
- Money transfer optimizations demonstrably reduce costs of international transfers
