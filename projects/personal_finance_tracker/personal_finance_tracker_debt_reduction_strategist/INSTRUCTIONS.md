# Debt Elimination Strategy System

A personal finance tracker focused on systematic debt reduction, with tools for optimizing payoff strategies, tracking progress, and maintaining motivation.

## Overview

This library provides a specialized finance management system designed specifically for individuals focused on eliminating debt. It offers multiple debt reduction strategy simulations, interest saving calculations, progress tracking with milestone celebrations, refinancing analysis, and credit impact estimation.

## Persona Description

Sophia is focused on systematically eliminating her student loans and credit card debt. She needs tools to track multiple debt accounts, optimize payoff strategies, and stay motivated through a multi-year debt elimination journey.

## Key Requirements

1. **Debt snowball/avalanche comparison showing different payoff strategy outcomes**
   - Implementation of both debt snowball (smallest balance first) and debt avalanche (highest interest first) methodologies
   - Side-by-side comparison of total interest paid and payoff timeline for different strategies
   - Custom strategy support allowing manual prioritization of specific debts
   - This feature is critical for helping users make informed decisions about debt payment prioritization based on mathematical and psychological factors

2. **Interest saved calculations demonstrating the impact of extra payments**
   - Real-time calculation of interest savings from additional payments
   - Amortization schedule generation showing principal and interest breakdown
   - "What-if" scenario modeling for variable payment amounts
   - This feature helps users understand the significant impact that even small additional payments can have on total interest paid and payoff time

3. **Payoff milestone celebrations with visual progress indicators and achievement tracking**
   - Customizable milestone definition based on amount or percentage of debt paid
   - Visual representations of progress toward debt freedom
   - Historical tracking of achievements to maintain motivation
   - This feature addresses the psychological challenge of maintaining motivation during a long-term debt reduction journey

4. **Refinancing scenario modeling to evaluate consolidation opportunities**
   - Simulation of debt consolidation with various interest rate and fee assumptions
   - Cost-benefit analysis of refinancing options including closing costs
   - Comparison of current vs. potential payment plans
   - This feature helps users make informed decisions about refinancing opportunities that could accelerate debt payoff or reduce total costs

5. **Credit score impact estimation based on debt reduction patterns and credit utilization**
   - Credit utilization ratio tracking across accounts
   - Projection of credit score changes based on debt reduction
   - Payment history tracking with on-time payment streaks
   - This feature connects debt reduction efforts to credit score improvements, providing additional motivation and financial benefit tracking

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All financial calculation algorithms must have unit tests with 100% code coverage
- Test cases must cover a wide range of debt scenarios (high/low interest, various balances)
- Time-dependent functions must support injectable time providers for deterministic testing
- Strategy comparison functions must be verified against pre-calculated reference examples

### Performance Expectations
- Strategy comparisons should process 20+ debt accounts in under 1 second
- Real-time recalculation when changing payment amounts or priorities
- Support for long-term projections (10+ years) without performance degradation
- Memory efficient storage of payment histories and projections

### Integration Points
- Import capabilities for existing debt account information
- Export functionality for payment plans and strategies
- Calendar integration for payment scheduling
- Optional reminder system for payment due dates

### Key Constraints
- Calculations must be transparent and explainable to users
- No external data transmission of sensitive financial information
- No dependency on third-party financial services for core functionality
- Clear separation between actual financial data and projections

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core components:

1. **Debt Account Management**:
   - Multiple account tracking with balance, interest rate, and terms
   - Payment history recording
   - Minimum payment calculation
   - Due date tracking and reminder generation

2. **Strategy Optimization Engine**:
   - Debt snowball methodology implementation
   - Debt avalanche methodology implementation
   - Custom strategy creation and evaluation
   - Comparative analysis between approaches

3. **Payment Impact Calculator**:
   - Amortization schedule generation
   - Interest saving calculations
   - Payment allocation recommendations
   - Extra payment impact visualization

4. **Progress Tracking System**:
   - Milestone definition and detection
   - Visual representation of debt reduction progress
   - Achievement history and celebration triggers
   - Motivational statistics and metrics

5. **Financial Analysis Tools**:
   - Refinancing scenario modeling
   - Credit utilization tracking
   - Credit score impact estimation
   - Total cost of debt analysis

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of debt payoff calculations under different strategies
- Correct interest and principal allocation for payments
- Proper detection and recording of debt payoff milestones
- Accurate analysis of refinancing scenarios
- Credit utilization ratio and score impact calculations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Setting up a debt reduction plan with multiple existing accounts
- Comparing snowball vs. avalanche approaches for a specific debt profile
- Recording payments and seeing updated projections
- Evaluating a potential refinancing opportunity
- Reaching milestones and receiving appropriate progress feedback

### Performance Benchmarks
- Strategy comparison for 20+ debts should complete in under 1 second
- Amortization schedules for 10+ year timeframes should generate in under 2 seconds
- Refinancing analysis with 10+ scenarios should complete in under 3 seconds
- System should remain responsive with 5+ years of payment history

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of variable interest rate debts
- Proper calculation with irregular additional payments
- Recovery from missed or late payments
- Edge cases around small remaining balances
- Handling of fees, penalties, and other non-interest charges

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 100% code coverage for all financial calculation algorithms
- Comprehensive test cases for all supported debt reduction strategies
- Verification against manually calculated examples
- Performance tests for operations on large debt portfolios

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can accurately compare different debt reduction strategies and see projected outcomes
2. The system correctly calculates interest savings from additional payments and payment restructuring
3. Progress tracking and milestone celebrations provide meaningful motivation through the debt reduction journey
4. Refinancing opportunities can be thoroughly evaluated with accurate cost-benefit analysis
5. Credit score impacts of debt reduction strategies are reasonably estimated and tracked
6. All financial calculations are verified against independent examples
7. The system maintains performance with realistic debt portfolios and multi-year projections
8. All tests pass with the required coverage and performance benchmarks

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
uv init --lib
```

This will create a virtual environment and generate a `pyproject.toml` file. To install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

To run individual Python scripts:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

To run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The implementation should focus on creating accurate financial algorithms that help users systematically eliminate debt while maintaining motivation throughout the process.
