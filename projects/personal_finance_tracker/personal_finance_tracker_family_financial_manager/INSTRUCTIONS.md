# Family Finance Management System

A personal finance tracker designed to manage and coordinate the financial activities of an entire household with multiple family members.

## Overview

This library provides a comprehensive family finance management system that allows tracking of individual and shared expenses within a household, manages allowances and financial education for children, and offers planning tools for major family life events and asset management.

## Persona Description

Maria manages the finances for her household, tracking spending for a family of five with diverse needs and activities. She needs to coordinate multiple accounts, track shared expenses, and ensure the family stays on budget while saving for future goals.

## Key Requirements

1. **Family member sub-accounts allowing individual tracking within the household**
   - Support for creating and managing separate financial profiles for each family member
   - Roll-up reporting to view combined household finances
   - Customizable permission system for different access levels based on age/role
   - This feature is critical for maintaining individual accountability while providing unified household financial management

2. **Allowance and chore payment management for teaching children financial responsibility**
   - Scheduled recurring allowance tracking with automatic recording
   - Task/chore tracking with associated monetary values
   - Goal-setting and savings tracking for children's accounts
   - This feature supports parents in teaching financial literacy and responsibility to children through practical experience

3. **Shared expense allocation automatically splitting costs between family members**
   - Configurable rules for expense splitting based on expense type
   - Support for different allocation methodologies (equal, percentage, custom)
   - Historical tracking of shared expense patterns
   - This feature simplifies the complex task of fairly distributing shared costs among family members

4. **Life event planning tools for education savings, home purchases, and family vacations**
   - Goal-based savings tracking for major family milestones
   - Scenario planning for different funding approaches
   - Progress visualization and milestone notifications
   - This feature helps families prepare financially for significant life events that require substantial saving

5. **Household inventory management tracking high-value assets and depreciation**
   - Asset registry with purchase information and documentation storage
   - Depreciation tracking for appropriate assets
   - Maintenance and warranty information management
   - This feature ensures proper tracking of family assets for insurance, maintenance, and financial planning purposes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All modules must have unit tests with â‰¥85% code coverage
- Full test suite must run in under 5 minutes
- Test data fixtures representing realistic family financial scenarios
- Integration tests must verify correct interaction between sub-accounts

### Performance Expectations
- Support for 10,000+ transactions across all family sub-accounts
- Response time under 1 second for most operations
- Bulk operations (e.g., expense allocation) should scale linearly with the number of items
- Low memory footprint to run on typical home computers

### Integration Points
- Import functionality for bank and credit card statements
- Export capabilities for tax preparation and financial planning
- Document storage integration for receipts and warranties
- Calendar integration for financial due dates and events

### Key Constraints
- Data should be storable locally without requiring external servers
- Clear separation between different family members' financial data
- Child-appropriate data representations for younger family members
- No transmission of personal financial data to external services

## Core Functionality

The system must provide these core components:

1. **Family Member Account Management**:
   - Sub-account creation with customizable permissions
   - Individual and household-level reporting
   - Activity tracking by family member
   - Age-appropriate financial education materials

2. **Transaction Management and Categorization**:
   - Multi-account transaction tracking
   - Shared expense identification and allocation
   - Customizable category hierarchies for family-specific needs
   - Recurring transaction management

3. **Allowance and Chore Management**:
   - Chore scheduling and completion tracking
   - Automatic and manual allowance distribution
   - Savings goal visualization for children
   - Financial education through practical money management

4. **Budget and Planning System**:
   - Family-wide and individual budgeting
   - Special event and milestone financial planning
   - Education and future planning calculators
   - Scenario modeling for major purchases

5. **Household Asset Management**:
   - Inventory tracking of significant household assets
   - Warranty and purchase documentation storage
   - Depreciation calculation for relevant assets
   - Maintenance scheduling and notification

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct creation and isolation of family member sub-accounts
- Accurate allocation of shared expenses across multiple profiles
- Proper management of recurring allowances and chore payments
- Goal tracking and progress calculation for various family objectives
- Asset valuation and depreciation calculation accuracy

### Critical User Scenarios
- Setting up accounts for a new family with members of different ages
- Recording and allocating a shared expense across specific family members
- Managing a child's allowance, savings goals, and financial education
- Planning and tracking progress toward a major family purchase or event
- Inventorying household assets with proper valuation and documentation

### Performance Benchmarks
- System should handle 5+ years of financial history for a 5-person family
- Shared expense allocation should process 100 transactions in under 3 seconds
- Reporting functions should generate results in under 2 seconds
- Asset management should support 500+ household items with documentation

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling the addition or removal of a family member mid-year
- Proper reallocation when shared expense details are modified retroactively
- Recovery from incomplete or inconsistent transaction data
- Graceful handling of age transitions affecting financial permissions
- Proper validation of complex expense allocation rules

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 85% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of core accounting and allocation logic
- Comprehensive integration tests for multi-account operations
- Performance tests for operations on large datasets

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Family members can have individual financial tracking while maintaining a unified view of household finances
2. Parents can effectively manage allowances and chore payments as teaching tools for financial responsibility
3. Shared household expenses can be automatically allocated to the appropriate family members based on configurable rules
4. The system supports planning and tracking for major family financial goals and life events
5. Household assets are properly tracked with relevant maintenance and warranty information
6. All operations remain responsive with realistic family financial datasets
7. The system provides age-appropriate interfaces or data representations for younger family members
8. All tests pass with the required coverage and performance benchmarks

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
uv init --lib
```

This will create a virtual environment and generate a `pyproject.toml` file. To install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

To run individual Python scripts:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

To run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The implementation should focus on creating well-structured, modular code that enables family financial management without unnecessary complexity.
