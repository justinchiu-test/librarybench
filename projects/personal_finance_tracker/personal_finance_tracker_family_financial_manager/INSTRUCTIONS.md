# Family-Oriented Financial Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive financial management system designed for household financial managers who need to track, coordinate, and optimize finances across multiple family members. This solution provides tools for managing shared expenses, individual allowances, financial education for children, and long-term family financial planning.

## Persona Description
Maria manages the finances for her household, tracking spending for a family of five with diverse needs and activities. She needs to coordinate multiple accounts, track shared expenses, and ensure the family stays on budget while saving for future goals.

## Key Requirements
1. **Family member sub-accounts allowing individual tracking within the household**
   - Support for multiple family member profiles within a unified system
   - Individual spending and saving tracking for each family member
   - Role-based permissions with parent/child hierarchies
   - Individual financial goals and milestone tracking
   - Critical for maintaining separate financial records while providing a holistic family view to the household manager

2. **Allowance and chore payment management for teaching children financial responsibility**
   - Recurring and one-time allowance payment system
   - Chore and task tracking with associated compensation
   - Automatic allowance adjustments based on completed responsibilities
   - Savings incentives and matching systems for educational purposes
   - Essential for helping parents use the financial system as a teaching tool for financial literacy

3. **Shared expense allocation automatically splitting costs between family members**
   - Configurable expense splitting rules (equal, percentage, custom)
   - Automatic categorization and allocation of shared household expenses
   - Historical tracking of shared expense patterns
   - Balance calculation between family members for reimbursement
   - Necessary for fairly distributing costs across the household while simplifying tracking

4. **Life event planning tools for education savings, home purchases, and family vacations**
   - Goal-based savings plans for major family events
   - Education cost forecasting and college savings calculators
   - Vacation and special event budgeting tools
   - Timeline visualization for multiple concurrent financial goals
   - Vital for long-term planning of significant family expenditures and investments

5. **Household inventory management tracking high-value assets and depreciation**
   - Inventory tracking for significant household purchases
   - Depreciation calculation for insurance and replacement planning
   - Warranty and maintenance record keeping
   - Replacement cost estimation and budgeting
   - Important for managing household assets as part of the complete financial picture

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**
  - All financial calculations must be deterministic and unit-testable
  - Simulations must support time-based testing through mocked time facilities
  - Financial allocations must be testable for balance and accuracy
  - Multi-user scenarios must be testable without complex setup
  - Integration tests must verify correct interactions between sub-systems

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Support for up to 20 family member accounts without performance degradation
  - Fast response time for common operations (under 100ms for calculations)
  - Efficient handling of 10+ years of transaction history
  - Batch operations for recurring events (allowances, bill payments)
  - Resource-efficient operation for deployment on modest hardware

- **Integration Points**
  - Import capabilities for bank and credit card statements
  - Export functionality for tax preparation
  - Integration with educational financial literacy resources
  - Calendar integration for payment schedules and financial events
  - Optional integration with household inventory management tools

- **Key Constraints**
  - All data must be storable locally for privacy
  - System must maintain data integrity with concurrent access
  - Child accounts must have appropriate safety limitations
  - Security measures must prevent manipulation by non-admin users
  - Clear separation between financial and non-financial data

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide these core components:

1. **Multi-User Account Management**
   - Family unit configuration with customizable roles
   - Individual profiles with appropriate permissions
   - Account linking and relationship definitions
   - Activity tracking and logging

2. **Transaction and Budget Engine**
   - Multi-account transaction recording and categorization
   - Shared expense allocation and settlement
   - Budget creation and tracking at household and individual levels
   - Recurring transaction management

3. **Allowance and Incentive System**
   - Task and chore tracking with financial rewards
   - Scheduled allowance payments with conditions
   - Savings incentives and matching programs
   - Financial goal progress visualization

4. **Financial Planning Tools**
   - Education cost projection and savings planning
   - Major purchase and event budgeting
   - Multi-goal coordination and prioritization
   - What-if scenario modeling for family decisions

5. **Household Asset Management**
   - Inventory tracking for significant purchases
   - Depreciation modeling and replacement planning
   - Maintenance scheduling and warranty tracking
   - Insurance coverage analysis and gap identification

6. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Family-wide financial health metrics
   - Individual spending and saving patterns
   - Comparative analysis between time periods
   - Progress tracking toward multiple financial goals

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities for Verification**
  - Accuracy of expense allocation between family members
  - Correct implementation of recurring allowance systems
  - Precise tracking of goal progress and projections
  - Proper handling of shared expenses and settlements
  - Accurate inventory valuation and depreciation calculations

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Setting up a new family unit with multiple members
  - Recording and allocating shared household expenses
  - Managing children's allowances with saving incentives
  - Planning and tracking progress toward education savings
  - Tracking household assets and planning for replacements

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Support for at least 10,000 historical transactions
  - Allocation of 100 shared expenses in under 5 seconds
  - Generation of complete family financial reports in under 3 seconds
  - Simulation of 5-year financial projections in under 10 seconds
  - Import of 1,000 transactions with categorization in under 30 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - Handling of incomplete expense allocation rules
  - Management of family membership changes (additions/removals)
  - Recovery from interrupted operations
  - Proper handling of date transitions for recurring events
  - Validation of unusual or potentially incorrect financial data
  - Resolution of conflicting allocation rules or shared expenses

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage for financial calculation functions
  - Comprehensive test suite for expense allocation algorithms
  - Thorough validation of goal tracking calculations
  - Complete testing of multi-user permission scenarios

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
- Expense allocations balance perfectly across family members
- Financial calculations match expected results with precision to 2 decimal places
- Goal tracking accurately reflects progress and projections
- Allowance systems operate correctly with all conditional rules
- Household inventory accurately represents depreciated values
- Transaction categorization is consistently accurate
- All reports generate with correct aggregate values
- Multi-user permissions function according to specifications
- Performance meets or exceeds all benchmark requirements
- Test coverage meets or exceeds specified metrics
