## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Financial concepts can be clearly demonstrated with appropriate simplification while maintaining accuracy
2. Decision simulations effectively illustrate the long-term impacts of different financial choices
3. Curriculum content can be organized in logical sequences with appropriate prerequisites
4. Assessment tools accurately measure student understanding of financial concepts
5. Challenge scenarios provide realistic application opportunities with meaningful feedback
6. Instructors can easily adapt content for different student knowledge levels
7. The system maintains performance with realistic classroom usage patterns
8. All tests pass with the required coverage and accuracy metrics

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
uv init --lib
```

This will create a virtual environment and generate a `pyproject.toml` file. To install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

To run individual Python scripts:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

To run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The implementation should focus on creating a robust educational tool that makes complex financial concepts accessible and engaging for students while giving instructors the flexibility they need to support diverse learning environments.
