## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can define, test, and apply custom ethical criteria to investment screening
2. Impact metrics are tracked alongside financial returns to provide a complete performance picture
3. Shareholder voting activities are properly recorded and analyzed against ethical priorities
4. Portfolio composition analysis clearly shows industry/sector concentrations and associated ethical considerations

6. All calculations are transparent and methodologies are clearly documented
7. The system maintains performance with realistic investment portfolios and spending histories
8. All tests pass with the required coverage and performance benchmarks

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
uv init --lib
```

This will create a virtual environment and generate a `pyproject.toml` file. To install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

To run individual Python scripts:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

To run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The implementation should focus on creating a flexible system that allows users to evaluate and manage their finances through the lens of their personal ethical values while maintaining solid financial analysis capabilities.
