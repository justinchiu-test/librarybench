# ResearchBrain: Knowledge Management System for Academic Researchers

## Overview
ResearchBrain is a specialized personal knowledge management system tailored for academic researchers who need to organize complex scientific literature, track research projects, and maintain structured connections between research notes, publications, and grant proposals.

## Persona Description
Dr. Elaine Chen is a neuroscience professor juggling multiple research projects, collaborations, and teaching responsibilities. She needs to organize complex scientific literature, experimental notes, and theoretical connections while preparing publications and grant proposals.

## Key Requirements
1. **Citation-aware note linking**: Automatically connect notes to referenced academic papers, enabling bidirectional navigation between research notes and their source materials. This feature is critical for maintaining rigorous academic standards by ensuring all claims and insights are properly attributed to primary sources.

2. **Research question tracking**: Create and maintain mappings between research hypotheses and both supporting and contradicting evidence. This allows Dr. Chen to evaluate the strength of different theoretical positions and identify gaps in existing research that need further investigation.

3. **Grant proposal workspaces**: Organize specific subsets of knowledge for funding applications, allowing selective curation of relevant research findings, preliminary data, and theoretical frameworks. This feature helps streamline the grant writing process by bringing together all materials needed for specific funding opportunities.

4. **Experiment logging templates**: Provide structured metadata templates for scientific reproducibility, ensuring consistent documentation of experimental methods, conditions, and results. This systematic approach to experiment documentation improves research integrity and facilitates future replication of studies.

5. **Collaborative annotation importing**: Import and integrate comments and feedback from colleagues while maintaining the integrity of the personal knowledge structure. This capability enables collaborative research while preserving individual organizational systems and intellectual approaches.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All knowledge management functions must be testable independently
  - Mock academic paper repositories must be available for testing citation features
  - Test fixtures should simulate realistic research data structures
  - Citation parsing functionality must be tested against common academic formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)

- **Performance expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle at least 10,000 interconnected notes
  - Citation link generation should process at least 100 papers per minute
  - Full-text search across all research materials should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Note linking operations should complete in under 500ms

- **Integration points**:
  - BibTeX/RIS citation format import/export
  - PDF metadata extraction for academic papers
  - Plain text and Markdown file support
  - Structured data export for statistical analysis

- **Key constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in accessible, plain-text formats
  - No dependency on external web services for core functionality
  - Must maintain data integrity during concurrent operations
  - Must prevent data loss during system interruptions

## Core Functionality
The system must implement a comprehensive knowledge management foundation with specialized academic research capabilities:

1. **Note Creation and Organization**:
   - Create, edit, and organize notes in plain text/Markdown
   - Support for academic formatting including citations, equations, and specialized terminology
   - Hierarchical and network-based organization systems

2. **Academic Citation Integration**:
   - Parse and index academic papers from PDF and reference files
   - Extract and store citation metadata (authors, journal, doi, etc.)
   - Link notes directly to specific sections or pages in source materials
   - Generate properly formatted citations for use in publications

3. **Research Mapping and Analysis**:
   - Create structured representations of research questions and hypotheses
   - Link evidence to specific research questions with strength indicators
   - Track contradictions and inconsistencies in research findings
   - Visualize research landscapes showing knowledge gaps

4. **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Import annotations and comments from collaborators
   - Selectively share knowledge subsets while maintaining master structure
   - Track attribution of ideas and contributions
   - Merge insights from multiple researchers while preserving source identity

5. **Project and Grant Management**:
   - Create workspaces for specific research projects or grant applications
   - Filter and organize knowledge by project relevance
   - Track project timelines and research progress
   - Generate structured reports and summaries for grant applications

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must be thoroughly testable with comprehensive pytest coverage:

- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Citation parsing accuracy for multiple academic formats
  - Bidirectional link integrity between notes and sources
  - Research question-evidence relationship mapping correctness
  - Template application for experimental documentation
  - Collaborative annotation merging without data corruption

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Complete workflow from paper import to citation linking to note creation
  - Research question analysis with conflicting evidence evaluation
  - Grant proposal assembly from distributed knowledge elements
  - Collaborative review and annotation of shared research materials
  - Experiment documentation with template-guided metadata

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Sub-second response time for most knowledge retrieval operations
  - Efficient handling of large (10,000+) note collections
  - Scalable citation linking that maintains performance with growing libraries
  - Memory-efficient operation suitable for standard workstation environments

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Malformed citation data in imported papers
  - Conflicting annotations from multiple collaborators
  - Circular reference detection and prevention
  - Recovery from interrupted operations
  - Handling of very large individual documents

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
  - 100% coverage of citation parsing and linking functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive integration tests
  - All error handling paths must be explicitly tested

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when it demonstrably:

1. Enables seamless navigation between personal research notes and their source materials with accurate citation linking
2. Provides clear visualization of research questions and their supporting/contradicting evidence
3. Facilitates the creation of focused grant proposal workspaces that efficiently organize relevant knowledge
4. Supports systematic experimental documentation with consistent metadata capture
5. Successfully incorporates collaborative feedback while maintaining personal knowledge organization
6. Performs efficiently with large research collections containing thousands of interconnected notes and papers
7. Preserves all data in accessible formats that ensure long-term availability and portability
8. Passes all specified tests with the required code coverage metrics
