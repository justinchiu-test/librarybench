   - Vital for maintaining methodological consistency across lab members and time
   - Ensures critical experimental parameters are always recorded
   - Facilitates comparison between experimental iterations
   - Supports rigorous scientific documentation for publication
   - Enables efficient training of new lab members on established protocols

5. **Collaborative annotation importing**: Import colleague comments while maintaining personal knowledge structure.
   - Essential for incorporating insights from collaborators without disrupting personal organization
   - Preserves the provenance of external contributions
   - Facilitates multi-investigator projects while maintaining individual perspectives
   - Enables selective integration of colleague insights
   - Supports academic mentorship by incorporating student contributions appropriately

4. **Grant Proposal System**
   - Create workspace collections for specific funding applications
   - Organize relevant notes, papers, and evidence for proposals
   - Track proposal status, deadlines, and outcomes
   - Template system for common proposal sections
   - Export functionality for collaborative writing

5. **Experimental Data Management**
   - Structured templates for experimental protocols
