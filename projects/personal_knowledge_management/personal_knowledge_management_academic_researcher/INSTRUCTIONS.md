# Scholar's BrainCache - Academic Research Knowledge Management System

## Overview
Scholar's BrainCache is a specialized personal knowledge management system tailored for academic researchers. It focuses on organizing complex scientific literature, experimental notes, and theoretical connections while facilitating the preparation of publications and grant proposals. The system enables researchers to create an interconnected network of academic knowledge that can be navigated, queried, and utilized efficiently for various scholarly outputs.

## Persona Description
Dr. Elaine Chen is a neuroscience professor juggling multiple research projects, collaborations, and teaching responsibilities. She needs to organize complex scientific literature, experimental notes, and theoretical connections while preparing publications and grant proposals.

## Key Requirements

1. **Citation-aware note linking** - Automatically connect notes to referenced academic papers, allowing bidirectional navigation between research notes and their source materials. This feature is critical for Dr. Chen to maintain the scholarly integrity of her work by preserving the connection between her insights and the literature they're based on, facilitating proper attribution and literature reviews.

2. **Research question tracking** - Map hypotheses to supporting evidence and contradictions, creating an evolving representation of research questions and their answers. This feature helps Dr. Chen maintain a clear overview of her scientific inquiry process, identify gaps in evidence, and recognize conflicting data that needs reconciliation, ultimately strengthening her research methodology.

3. **Grant proposal workspaces** - Organize specific subsets of knowledge for funding applications, allowing the creation of focused collections of notes, evidence, and arguments tailored to specific funding opportunities. This feature addresses Dr. Chen's need to efficiently repurpose her knowledge base for different grant applications, saving substantial time in proposal preparation while ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant research.

4. **Experiment logging templates** - Structured metadata templates for scientific reproducibility that standardize the recording of experimental parameters, observations, and results. These templates ensure Dr. Chen's experiments are documented comprehensively with all relevant metadata, facilitating reproducibility, methodological consistency across her lab, and efficient retrieval of experimental details for publications.

5. **Collaborative annotation importing** - Import colleague comments while maintaining personal knowledge structure, enabling the integration of insights from collaborators without disrupting individual organizational systems. This feature supports Dr. Chen's collaborative research projects by allowing her to incorporate feedback and ideas from colleagues into her knowledge base while preserving her own organizational structure and thought connections.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All knowledge management functionality must be accessible through well-defined APIs
- Note creation, linking, querying, and retrieval operations must support comprehensive unit testing
- External file interactions should be abstraction-ready for testing with mock file systems
- Citation linking functionality must be testable without requiring actual external academic databases
- Data structures must allow for inspection and validation during test execution

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 10,000 notes with full-text search completing in under 2 seconds
- Bibliography handling capable of managing at least 5,000 references without performance degradation
- Note linking operations (creating/traversing) should complete in under 100ms
- Bulk operations (like importing/exporting) should process at least 10 notes per second
- Index updates must be efficient enough to run automatically after each note modification

### Integration Points
- Plain text Markdown file storage with standardized formatting for bidirectional links
- BibTeX integration for citation management
- File system interface for note storage using standard file formats
- Optional integration points with reference management systems through standard formats
- Export interfaces for common academic outputs (publications, grant proposals)

### Key Constraints
- All data must be stored locally in standard, human-readable formats (primarily Markdown and plain text)
- No reliance on external cloud services for core functionality
- Must maintain references to source materials in a way that survives file reorganization
- System must operate efficiently on a standard laptop without specialized hardware
- All note connections and metadata must degrade gracefully when viewed with standard text editors

## Core Functionality

The Scholar's BrainCache system must implement these core capabilities:

1. **Knowledge Base Management**
   - Create, update, and organize research notes in Markdown format
   - Maintain bidirectional links between related notes
   - Support tagging and categorization systems for knowledge organization
   - Provide efficient navigation between connected concepts

2. **Academic Citation Integration**
   - Parse and manage BibTeX references
   - Connect notes to specific academic papers by citation key
   - Track which parts of papers (pages, sections) are referenced in notes
   - Generate bibliographies from referenced material for export

3. **Research Question Framework**
   - Create and track research questions/hypotheses
   - Link evidence (supporting and contradicting) to research questions
   - Visualize the state of evidence for different research questions
   - Identify knowledge gaps requiring further investigation

4. **Grant Proposal Organization**
   - Create workspace collections for specific funding opportunities
   - Gather relevant notes, papers, and evidence into proposal-specific views
   - Track proposal requirements and map available knowledge to them
   - Generate structured exports suitable for grant writing

5. **Experimental Documentation System**
   - Define and use templates for different experiment types
   - Record structured metadata for experimental parameters
   - Link experimental results to research questions
   - Support versioning of experimental protocols

6. **Collaborative Knowledge Integration**
   - Import annotations and comments from external sources
   - Attribute imported knowledge to collaborators
   - Merge external insights while maintaining knowledge structure
   - Resolve conflicts between personal views and external inputs

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of research notes
- Establishment and traversal of bidirectional links between notes
- Citation management and integration with research notes
- Research question tracking with evidence mapping
- Grant proposal workspace organization and content filtering
- Experiment logging with template-based metadata capture
- Collaborative annotation importing and integration

### Critical User Scenarios
- Researcher reviewing literature and creating interconnected notes
- Identifying all notes related to a specific research question
- Preparing a grant proposal by assembling relevant knowledge
- Documenting experimental methods and results
- Incorporating collaborator feedback into personal knowledge structure
- Searching for specific information across the knowledge base
- Exporting formatted content for academic publications

### Performance Benchmarks
- Search response time under 2 seconds for full-text search across 10,000 notes
- Link traversal under 100ms for navigation between connected notes
- Citation database queries under 500ms for reference lookup
- Index updates under 1 second after note modifications
- Bulk operations processing at least 10 items per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed citation data
- Resolving circular reference links
- Managing conflicting metadata from different collaborators
- Recovering from interrupted operations
- Handling exceptionally large notes or reference collections
- Maintaining integrity when referenced files are missing
