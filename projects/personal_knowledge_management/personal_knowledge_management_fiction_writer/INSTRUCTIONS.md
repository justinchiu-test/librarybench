# NarrativeNexus - Fiction Writer's Knowledge Management System

A specialized personal knowledge management system designed for fiction writers creating complex narrative worlds with intricate character relationships, plot arcs, and worldbuilding elements.

## Overview

NarrativeNexus is a comprehensive knowledge management system specifically designed for fiction writers working on complex fictional universes. The system facilitates the creation, organization, and maintenance of consistent worldbuilding elements, character development arcs, plot structures, and narrative timelines. By providing powerful tools for tracking relationships between fictional elements, maintaining narrative consistency, and visualizing story structures, the system enables writers to manage extensive creative projects while maintaining coherence across multiple volumes or story arcs.

## Persona Description

Amara is writing a fantasy novel series with complex worldbuilding, character relationships, and plot arcs spanning multiple volumes. She needs to maintain consistency across her fictional universe while developing intricate storylines.

## Key Requirements

1. **Character relationship mapping**: Build, visualize, and track interactions, conflicts, and development arcs between characters.
   - Critical for Amara to maintain a clear understanding of complex interpersonal dynamics
   - Enables consistent character motivations and reactions throughout the series
   - Helps identify unexplored relationship dynamics with storytelling potential
   - Allows tracking of character development trajectories across multiple volumes
   - Prevents continuity errors in how characters relate to one another

2. **Worldbuilding consistency checking**: Identify and highlight contradictions in fictional elements across the narrative.
   - Essential for maintaining the integrity of the fictional universe
   - Prevents embarrassing continuity errors that disrupt reader immersion
   - Tracks evolving world elements (politics, magic systems, technology) as they develop
   - Ensures that established rules of the fictional world are consistently applied
   - Facilitates expansion of the world without contradicting established elements

3. **Narrative timeline visualization**: Track both in-world chronology and narrative presentation order.
   - Crucial for managing complex temporal structures, especially with non-linear narratives
   - Helps maintain causal consistency in event sequences
   - Enables planning of reveals and information disclosure across the narrative
   - Facilitates management of multiple concurrent storylines
   - Ensures that character knowledge is consistent with their timeline position

4. **Plot thread tracking**: Ensure all introduced narrative elements reach appropriate resolution.
   - Vital for preventing plot holes and abandoned storylines
   - Helps maintain narrative tension and reader satisfaction
   - Enables balancing multiple subplots across a complex narrative
   - Identifies dependencies between different narrative elements
   - Supports satisfying conclusions by ensuring all significant elements are addressed

5. **Inspiration collection**: Link real-world research to fictional interpretations and adaptations.
   - Essential for grounding fantastic elements in relatable contexts
   - Helps maintain consistent application of research across the narrative
   - Provides quick reference to factual bases for fictional extrapolations
   - Organizes reference materials by their fictional applications
   - Facilitates deepening of worldbuilding elements with factual underpinnings

## Technical Requirements

- Mock character networks should scale to at least 100 characters with 500+ relationships
- Timeline testing should verify causality preservation across complex non-linear narratives
- Consistency checking algorithms must correctly identify contradictions in world rules and character behaviors

### Performance Expectations
- Relationship graph operations should handle 200+ characters with 1000+ connections
- Timeline visualization should manage 500+ events across multiple storylines
- Consistency checking should complete in under 3 seconds for worlds with 1000+ elements
- Full-text search across all content should return results in under 1 second
- System should remain responsive with 10,000+ notes and narrative elements

### Integration Points
- Plain text and Markdown file system storage
- JSON/YAML export for backup and portability
- Optional image reference linking for visual inspiration
- CSV export for timeline data
- Graph data formats for visualization in external tools

### Key Constraints
- All data must be stored locally as plain text files for longevity
- No external API dependencies for core functionality
- System must be usable offline
- Performance must remain strong with large fictional universes (10+ books worth of content)
- Data structures must prioritize integrity to prevent narrative inconsistencies

## Core Functionality

The NarrativeNexus system should implement the following core functionality:

1. **Character Management System**
   - Create and edit character profiles with consistent attributes
   - Define and visualize relationships between characters
   - Track character development arcs and transformations over time
   - Maintain character knowledge states at different narrative points
   - Flag potential character inconsistencies

2. **Worldbuilding Framework**
   - Define and organize world elements (locations, cultures, magic systems, technologies)
   - Link related worldbuilding elements in a knowledge graph
   - Track rule systems governing the fictional universe
   - Identify consistency issues between world elements
   - Maintain geographical and cultural relationships

3. **Timeline Management**
   - Create multiple timeline views (chronological, publication, character-specific)
   - Link narrative events to specific timeline positions
   - Visualize concurrent storylines and their intersections
   - Verify causal consistency across timeline events
   - Track narrative pacing and event distribution

4. **Plot Architecture**
   - Define and track plot threads from introduction to resolution
   - Link plot elements to characters, world elements, and timeline events
   - Identify unresolved or abandoned plot threads
   - Track narrative promises and their fulfillment
   - Analyze structural patterns across the narrative

5. **Research Integration**
   - Import and organize reference materials and inspirations
   - Link research elements to their fictional adaptations
   - Maintain source attribution for inspired elements
   - Categorize reference materials by topic and application
   - Track consistency in how research is applied to fiction

6. **Consistency Engine**
   - Perform automated checks for logical contradictions
   - Identify timeline causality violations
   - Flag character behavior inconsistencies
   - Detect worldbuilding rule contradictions
   - Provide specific error reports with resolution suggestions

7. **Search and Discovery**
   - Implement full-text search across all narrative elements
   - Find connections between seemingly unrelated story components
   - Identify underutilized story elements with potential
   - Support complex queries across different element types
   - Generate relationship reports and visualizations

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Character relationship tracking and visualization
- Worldbuilding element consistency checking
