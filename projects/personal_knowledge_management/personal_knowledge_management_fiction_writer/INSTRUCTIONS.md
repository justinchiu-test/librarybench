# StoryVerse: Knowledge Management System for Fiction Writers

## Overview
StoryVerse is a specialized personal knowledge management system designed for fiction writers who need to maintain consistency across complex fictional universes while tracking intricate character relationships, plot elements, and worldbuilding details across multiple volumes or stories.

## Persona Description
Amara is writing a fantasy novel series with complex worldbuilding, character relationships, and plot arcs spanning multiple volumes. She needs to maintain consistency across her fictional universe while developing intricate storylines.

## Key Requirements
1. **Character relationship mapping**: Create and visualize connections between characters, including familial ties, alliances, conflicts, and development arcs throughout the narrative. This feature is essential for maintaining consistent character interactions across a complex story, preventing continuity errors in relationships, and tracking how character dynamics evolve over time.

2. **Worldbuilding consistency checking**: Identify and highlight contradictions in fictional elements such as magical systems, technologies, cultural practices, and geographical features. This capability helps Amara maintain the internal logic of her fantasy world, ensuring that established rules are followed consistently and that readers remain immersed in a coherent fictional universe.

3. **Narrative timeline visualization**: Track both in-world chronology (when events occur in the story's universe) and narrative presentation (the order in which events are revealed to readers). This dual timeline tracking is crucial for managing complex non-linear storytelling, ensuring historical consistency within the fictional world, and planning strategic information reveals.

4. **Plot thread tracking**: Monitor introduced story elements to ensure all receive appropriate resolution, preventing dropped plot threads and unresolved story promises. This feature helps Amara deliver satisfying narratives by ensuring that every significant element introduced receives proper development and conclusion, enhancing reader satisfaction.

5. **Inspiration collection**: Link real-world research materials to their fictional interpretations, maintaining a bridge between historical, scientific, or cultural research and creative adaptations. This connection helps ground fantasy elements in recognizable reality, provides depth to worldbuilding, and creates a repository of inspiration that can spark new creative directions.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All relationship tracking functions must be independently testable
  - Consistency checking algorithms must be verifiable with known test cases
  - Timeline management must be validated for both chronological and presentation orders
  - Plot element tracking must be testable with complete and incomplete narrative arcs
  - Inspiration linking must maintain traceable connections between sources and creative implementations

- **Performance expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle data for a series with 50+ characters, 10+ volumes, and 1000+ worldbuilding elements
  - Relationship map generation should render in under 3 seconds
  - Consistency checks should complete in under 5 seconds for the entire story universe
  - Full-text search across all story elements should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Timeline operations should support at least 500 distinct events while maintaining responsiveness

- **Integration points**:
  - Plain text and Markdown file support
  - Export capabilities for visual mapping tools (ASCII/Unicode art)
  - Research material organization and linking
  - Version control for evolving story elements
  - Structured data export for external analysis or visualization

- **Key constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in accessible, plain-text formats
  - No dependency on external web services for core functionality
  - Must support offline operation
  - Must maintain separation between inspirational source material and derived creative content
  - System must prevent unintentional overwriting of established story canon

## Core Functionality
The system must implement a comprehensive knowledge management foundation with specialized features for fiction writing:

1. **Character Management System**:
   - Create detailed character profiles with physical, psychological, and narrative attributes
   - Track evolution of character traits and abilities throughout story progression
   - Visualize and navigate relationships between characters
   - Monitor character appearances and significant moments across the narrative

2. **Worldbuilding Framework**:
   - Organize fictional world elements by categories (magic systems, geography, cultures, etc.)
   - Define rules and constraints governing the fictional universe
   - Check new content against established world rules for consistency
   - Track evolution of world elements throughout the narrative timeline

3. **Narrative Timeline Management**:
   - Maintain separate tracks for in-world chronology and reader presentation order
   - Place events on absolute or relative timelines with flexibility for revisions
   - Visualize event sequences and identify temporal inconsistencies
   - Link timeline events to specific story sections or chapters

4. **Plot and Story Arc Tracking**:
   - Define major and minor plot threads with expected narrative progression
   - Link story promises (foreshadowing, setups) with their fulfillment (payoffs, resolutions)
   - Track narrative questions raised and answered throughout the story
   - Monitor the completeness of narrative arcs for satisfying resolution

5. **Research and Inspiration Integration**:
   - Import and organize reference materials and research notes
   - Create explicit links between real-world inspiration and fictional implementations
   - Track transformations from research to creative interpretation
   - Maintain source attribution for borrowed concepts or adaptations

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must be thoroughly testable with comprehensive pytest coverage:

- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Character relationship tracking correctly identifies all connection types
  - Worldbuilding consistency checking accurately flags contradictions in fictional elements
  - Timeline management properly handles both chronological and presentation orders
  - Plot thread tracking correctly identifies unresolved story elements
  - Inspiration collection maintains accurate links between research and creative adaptations

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Building a complex character network and checking for relationship consistency
  - Defining world rules and testing new content against established constraints
  - Creating dual timelines and identifying chronological inconsistencies
  - Tracking multiple plot threads from introduction to resolution
  - Linking research materials to creative implementations across a story universe

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Sub-second response time for most knowledge retrieval operations
  - Efficient handling of 1000+ interconnected story elements
  - Responsive visualization of complex character networks
  - Memory-efficient operation suitable for standard laptop environments

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Circular relationships or dependency loops in story elements
  - Extremely non-linear narratives with complex timeline relationships
  - Deliberate inconsistencies (e.g., unreliable narrator situations)
  - Massive character casts with intricate relationship webs
  - Long-running series with evolving worldbuilding rules

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
  - 100% coverage of consistency checking and timeline management functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive integration tests
  - All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
