# DissertationMind: Knowledge Management System for Graduate Students

## Overview
DissertationMind is a specialized personal knowledge management system designed for PhD students who need to process hundreds of sources, track complex theoretical frameworks, and develop dissertation arguments while maintaining clear scholarly lineages and attribution.

## Persona Description
Miguel is pursuing a PhD in philosophy, processing hundreds of sources while developing his dissertation framework. He needs to track theoretical influences, evolving arguments, and thematic connections across a vast body of literature.

## Key Requirements
1. **Argument mapping**: Visualize the logical structure of developing philosophical positions, capturing premises, conclusions, objections, and rebuttals in a structured format. This feature is crucial for Miguel to clarify complex philosophical arguments, identify logical gaps, and strengthen his dissertation's theoretical foundation.

2. **Theoretical lineage tracking**: Create and maintain networks showing the evolution of ideas through different thinkers and philosophical traditions. This helps Miguel establish the scholarly context of his work, demonstrate his understanding of his field's intellectual history, and position his contribution within ongoing philosophical conversations.

3. **Quotation management**: Capture direct quotations with precise source attribution, page numbers, and surrounding context. This feature ensures academic integrity by maintaining exact wording and complete citation information, while also preserving the original context that might be relevant for interpretation.

4. **Dissertation section planning**: Link outline elements to supporting notes and sources, creating a dynamic bridge between the dissertation structure and the underlying research materials. This enables Miguel to organize his massive collection of notes into a coherent dissertation structure and easily access relevant sources during the writing process.

5. **Advisor feedback integration**: Capture and incorporate insights from seminar discussions and advisor meetings directly into the knowledge structure. This feature helps Miguel integrate valuable guidance from his academic mentors into his developing work while maintaining clear distinction between his ideas and external input.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All knowledge organization functions must be independently testable
  - Argument structures must be verifiable for logical consistency
  - Citation tracking must be testable against academic standards
  - Document outlining and linking functionality must be validated through automated tests
  - Feedback integration must maintain clear source attribution

- **Performance expectations**:
  - System must handle at least 5,000 interconnected notes and 500 source documents
  - Argument map generation should render in under 3 seconds
  - Full-text search across all materials should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Note linking and relationship visualization should operate in near real-time
  - System should perform efficiently on standard laptop hardware

- **Integration points**:
  - Plain text and Markdown file support
  - Bibliography management system integration (BibTeX)
  - PDF annotation import
  - Text-based visualization export
  - Structured data export for external analysis

- **Key constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in accessible, plain-text formats
  - No dependency on external web services for core functionality
  - System must work effectively offline
  - Must maintain separation between original source content and personal annotations
  - Must preserve academic attribution chains

## Core Functionality
The system must implement a comprehensive knowledge management foundation with specialized features for dissertation development:

1. **Argument Structure Management**:
   - Create structured argument maps capturing premises, conclusions, and logical connections
   - Track objections and responses to arguments
   - Evaluate logical consistency and identify gaps in argumentation
   - Connect argument elements to supporting sources and evidence

2. **Theoretical Framework Development**:
   - Track influence networks between philosophers and theoretical traditions
   - Map how specific concepts have evolved through different thinkers
   - Identify conceptual similarities and differences across various philosophers
   - Visualize the theoretical landscape surrounding dissertation topics

3. **Source Management and Attribution**:
   - Import and organize source materials from various formats
   - Capture direct quotations with complete citation information
   - Maintain context around quotations for proper interpretation
   - Generate properly formatted citations for use in academic writing

4. **Dissertation Structure Organization**:
   - Create dynamic outlines linked to underlying research materials
   - Organize notes by dissertation section and subsection
   - Track the development of specific chapters and arguments
   - Generate progress reports on dissertation development

5. **Feedback and Iteration Tracking**:
   - Record and integrate advisor comments and seminar feedback
   - Track the evolution of ideas in response to academic input
   - Maintain version history of developing arguments
   - Compare different iterations of theoretical positions

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must be thoroughly testable with comprehensive pytest coverage:

- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Argument mapping maintains logical consistency and proper connections
  - Theoretical lineage tracking correctly identifies influence relationships
  - Quotation system preserves exact text and complete citation information
  - Dissertation outlining properly links to supporting materials
  - Feedback integration maintains clear attribution and version history

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Complete workflow from source reading to quotation extraction to argument integration
  - Building a theoretical framework showing influences across multiple philosophers
  - Creating a dissertation chapter with properly structured arguments and sources
  - Integrating advisor feedback into existing knowledge structures
  - Navigating between dissertation outline and supporting research materials

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Sub-second response time for most knowledge retrieval operations
  - Efficient handling of 5,000+ interconnected notes
  - Responsive visualization of complex argument structures
  - Memory-efficient operation suitable for standard laptop environments

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Circular arguments and reference loops
  - Incomplete citation information in imported sources
  - Contradictory feedback from different advisors
  - Very large individual documents or quotations
  - Complex argument structures with many branches and objections

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
  - 100% coverage of argument mapping and citation management functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive integration tests
  - All error handling paths must be explicitly tested

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when it demonstrably:

1. Enables clear visualization and navigation of complex philosophical arguments with their logical structure explicitly represented
2. Accurately tracks and visually represents the evolution of ideas through different thinkers and traditions
3. Manages quotations with perfect fidelity to the original text and complete citation information
4. Provides a dynamic bridge between dissertation outline and underlying research materials
5. Successfully incorporates and attributes advisor feedback while maintaining version history
6. Performs efficiently with large collections containing thousands of notes and hundreds of sources
7. Preserves all data in accessible formats that ensure long-term availability
8. Passes all specified tests with the required code coverage metrics
