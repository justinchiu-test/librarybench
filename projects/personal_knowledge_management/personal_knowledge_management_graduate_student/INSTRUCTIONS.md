# PhD Research Navigator

A specialized personal knowledge management system designed for graduate students to process hundreds of sources while developing dissertation frameworks.

## Overview

PhD Research Navigator is a comprehensive knowledge management system designed specifically for graduate students managing extensive academic literature while developing theoretical frameworks for dissertations. The system excels at tracking theoretical influences, organizing evolving arguments, and discovering thematic connections across diverse sources. It emphasizes structured thinking, argument development, and quotation management while supporting the iterative nature of dissertation writing and advisor feedback integration.

## Persona Description

Miguel is pursuing a PhD in philosophy, processing hundreds of sources while developing his dissertation framework. He needs to track theoretical influences, evolving arguments, and thematic connections across a vast body of literature.

2. **Theoretical lineage tracking**: Create structured relationships showing the evolution of ideas through different thinkers.
   - Essential for contextualizing philosophical positions within their historical development
   - Enables clear attribution of intellectual influences and departures from previous thought
   - Helps identify intellectual "family trees" and schools of thought
   - Supports tracing the development and transformation of concepts over time
   - Facilitates recognition of conceptual innovations versus refinements of existing ideas

3. **Quotation management**: Capture and organize direct quotes with context preservation and source attribution.
   - Vital for maintaining accurate representations of others' philosophical positions

   - Enables rapid retrieval of key quotations during writing
   - Facilitates comparison of different thinkers' exact formulations on similar topics
   - Supports critical engagement with primary texts by organizing textual evidence

4. **Dissertation section planning**: Link outline elements to supporting notes and sources.
   - Crucial for managing the complex structure of a book-length dissertation
   - Enables iterative refinement of dissertation organization
   - Helps maintain cohesion between chapters and sections
   - Facilitates balanced coverage of necessary topics and literature
   - Supports identifying gaps in research or argumentation that need addressing

5. **Advisor feedback integration**: Capture seminar and meeting insights within knowledge structure.
   - Essential for tracking evolving guidance from dissertation committee members
   - Connects specific feedback to relevant dissertation sections and arguments
   - Helps prioritize revisions based on advisor emphasis
   - Enables tracking of how feedback has been addressed over time
   - Facilitates preparation for advisor meetings by organizing relevant questions and progress updates

3. **Theoretical Lineage Framework**
   - Define thinkers and their key concepts
   - Track influence relationships between philosophers
   - Categorize types of intellectual influence (extension, critique, synthesis)
   - Visualize intellectual genealogies and conceptual evolution
   - Identify schools of thought and intellectual movements

4. **Quotation Database**
   - Store direct quotations with source information and page numbers
   - Maintain original context and textual surroundings
   - Categorize quotes by theme, concept, or argument role
   - Provide attribution and citation formatting
   - Support multi-language quotations with translations

5. **Dissertation Architecture**

   - Link outline elements to notes, arguments, and sources
   - Track section status and development progress
   - Identify content gaps and research needs
   - Support restructuring with relationship preservation

6. **Advisor Interaction System**
   - Record and categorize feedback from dissertation committee members
