   - Link arguments to specific cited cases and statutes
   - Evaluate precedential value and applicability
   - Track citation networks and referential relationships
   - Monitor subsequent treatment of key precedents

3. **Matter Management Framework**
   - Create isolated matter containers with controlled sharing
   - Define ethical walls between related matters
   - Support team collaboration with appropriate access controls
   - Implement knowledge promotion from matter-specific to general
   - Maintain client confidentiality while enabling knowledge reuse

4. **Statutory and Regulatory Tracking**
   - Store and version statutes and regulations
   - Track amendment history with effective dates
   - Compare statutory language across versions
   - Link regulatory interpretations to specific provisions
   - Alert on relevant legislative or regulatory changes

5. **Argument Development System**
   - Create template argument structures for common issues
   - Link elements to supporting precedent and evidence
   - Adapt established arguments to new factual contexts
   - Track argument success rates across different forums
   - Identify counter-arguments and responsive strategies

6. **Confidentiality Management**
   - Implement multi-level confidentiality classification
   - Filter content for client-safe or public consumption
   - Anonymize case-specific details while preserving legal principles
   - Audit information sharing for compliance purposes
   - Prevent unauthorized access to confidential information

7. **Knowledge Discovery**
   - Implement powerful search with relevance ranking
   - Find connections between legal concepts and arguments
   - Identify applicable precedent for novel legal questions
   - Track jurisprudential trends across court decisions
   - Generate reports on legal position strength

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Legal citation parsing and linking accuracy
