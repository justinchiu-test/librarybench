# MedicalMind: Knowledge Management System for Medical Students

## Overview
MedicalMind is a specialized personal knowledge management system designed for medical students who need to organize vast amounts of interconnected medical knowledge across body systems, diseases, and treatment approaches while optimizing retention through spaced repetition and clinical case integration.

## Persona Description
Jamal is studying medicine, absorbing vast amounts of information across different body systems, diseases, and treatment approaches. He needs to create interconnected medical knowledge that links symptoms, pathophysiology, and interventions.

## Key Requirements
1. **Anatomical relationship mapping**: Create and navigate connections between body structures, physiological functions, and associated pathologies. This feature is crucial for Jamal to understand how anatomical structures relate to each other both spatially and functionally, and how abnormalities in structure lead to specific disease presentations and clinical findings.

2. **Diagnostic decision trees**: Develop interactive clinical reasoning paths that link symptoms to potential conditions with associated probabilities and key differentiating factors. This capability helps Jamal develop systematic diagnostic thinking, understand the relative likelihood of different conditions for presenting symptoms, and identify the most useful tests or observations to narrow diagnostic possibilities.

3. **Pharmacological reference**: Build a comprehensive medication knowledge base that connects drugs with their mechanisms of action, indications, contraindications, and interaction profiles. This reference system is essential for learning the complex world of pharmacology, understanding why specific medications are chosen for particular conditions, and recognizing potential adverse effects or interactions.

4. **Spaced repetition optimization**: Implement an intelligent review system that prioritizes medical knowledge review based on exam schedules, difficulty, and importance. This learning optimization is critical for managing the enormous volume of information in medical education, ensuring that high-yield content receives appropriate focus, and timing reviews to align with upcoming assessments.

5. **Clinical case integration**: Link theoretical medical knowledge with patient presentations by connecting pathophysiological concepts to their real-world manifestations in clinical scenarios. This bridging of theory and practice helps Jamal contextualize abstract medical concepts, understand how diseases present in actual patients, and develop clinical reasoning skills necessary for medical practice.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All relationship mapping functions must be independently testable
  - Diagnostic algorithms must be verifiable against established clinical guidelines
  - Pharmacological data accuracy must be testable against authoritative references
  - Spaced repetition scheduling must be validated for optimal retention
  - Clinical case linkage must be verifiable for accuracy and relevance

- **Performance expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle 10,000+ interconnected medical concepts
  - Anatomical relationship visualization should render in under 3 seconds
  - Diagnostic path generation should complete in under 2 seconds
  - Full-text search across all medical knowledge should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Spaced repetition scheduling should process 5,000+ items in under 5 seconds

- **Integration points**:
  - Plain text and Markdown file support
  - Structured medical knowledge databases (optional)
  - Evidence-based medicine resources
  - Exam and study schedule management
  - Clinical case repository

- **Key constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in accessible, plain-text formats

## Core Functionality
The system must implement a comprehensive knowledge management foundation with specialized features for medical education:

1. **Medical Knowledge Organization**:
   - Create structured representations of anatomical and physiological concepts
   - Organize information by body systems, disease processes, and clinical presentations
   - Link related concepts across traditional medical education boundaries
   - Support both hierarchical and network-based organization of medical knowledge

2. **Clinical Reasoning Framework**:
   - Build diagnostic pathways from symptoms to potential diagnoses
   - Assign likelihood values to different diagnostic possibilities
   - Identify key distinguishing features between similar conditions
   - Integrate evidence-based decision support for diagnostic processes

3. **Pharmacological Information Management**:
   - Create comprehensive medication profiles with mechanism, indications, and effects
   - Track drug interactions and contraindications
   - Link medications to the conditions they treat and the mechanisms of those conditions
   - Organize pharmacological knowledge by drug class and clinical application

4. **Learning Optimization System**:
   - Implement spaced repetition algorithms tuned for medical knowledge
   - Prioritize review based on exam schedules, difficulty, and clinical relevance
   - Track knowledge retention and identify areas needing additional focus
   - Optimize study time allocation across different medical domains

5. **Clinical Application Integration**:
   - Create and manage clinical case repositories
   - Link theoretical concepts to their clinical manifestations
   - Build pattern recognition for common and atypical disease presentations
   - Bridge basic science foundations with clinical applications

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must be thoroughly testable with comprehensive pytest coverage:

- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Anatomical relationship mapping correctly represents structural and functional connections
  - Diagnostic pathways correctly link symptoms to potential conditions with appropriate probabilities
  - Pharmacological reference accurately captures medication properties and relationships
  - Spaced repetition scheduling produces optimal review intervals for different content types
  - Clinical case integration properly connects theoretical concepts with practical applications

  - Working through a diagnostic pathway from presenting symptoms to potential conditions
  - Accessing comprehensive information about medications and their clinical applications
  - Receiving optimized review schedules based on exam timing and content difficulty
  - Connecting theoretical knowledge to clinical presentations through representative cases

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Sub-second response time for most knowledge retrieval operations
  - Efficient handling of 10,000+ interconnected medical concepts
  - Responsive generation of complex relationship visualizations
  - Memory-efficient operation suitable for standard laptop environments

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Rare or atypical disease presentations
  - Complex anatomical variations
  - Medications with extensive interaction profiles
  - Conflicting information from different medical sources
  - Ambiguous symptoms with multiple possible interpretations

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
  - 100% coverage of diagnostic pathways and spaced repetition functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive integration tests
