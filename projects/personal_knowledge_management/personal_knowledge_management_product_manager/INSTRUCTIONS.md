# ProductInsight - Strategic Product Knowledge System

A specialized personal knowledge management system for product managers to organize user feedback, feature requests, market research, and strategic decision making.

## Overview

ProductInsight is a comprehensive knowledge management system designed specifically for product managers who oversee complex software products with multiple stakeholders. The system excels at organizing and analyzing user feedback, tracking competitive intelligence, documenting strategic decisions, and aligning feature development with business objectives. It emphasizes data-driven decision making, stakeholder perspective mapping, and the creation of coherent product development narratives while maintaining a structured approach to product evolution.

## Persona Description

Sophia oversees a complex software product with multiple stakeholders, feature requests, and market research inputs. She needs to track user feedback, competitive analysis, and strategic decisions to guide product development.

## Key Requirements

1. **Customer feedback clustering**: Automatically group and analyze similar requests and pain points.
   - Critical for Sophia to identify patterns in user needs across hundreds of individual feedback points
   - Enables prioritization based on impact rather than just frequency or recency
   - Helps distinguish between symptoms and root problems in user feedback
   - Facilitates creating coherent user stories from fragmented feedback
   - Supports data-driven product decisions with quantifiable user impact metrics

2. **Feature prioritization framework**: Create structured relationships linking requests to strategic objectives.
   - Essential for aligning product development with business strategy
   - Enables objective evaluation of competing feature requests
   - Helps justify development decisions to stakeholders with clear strategic reasoning
   - Facilitates resource allocation across multiple product initiatives
   - Supports consistent evaluation of new opportunities as they arise

3. **Competitive intelligence tracking**: Monitor and analyze market positioning against alternatives.
   - Vital for understanding product differentiation opportunities
   - Enables gap analysis between product capabilities and competitor offerings
   - Helps identify market trends and emerging opportunities
   - Facilitates strategic positioning decisions with comprehensive market context
   - Supports pricing and packaging decisions with competitive benchmarking

4. **Decision documentation**: Capture and preserve context and rationale for product choices.
   - Crucial for maintaining organizational memory across product iterations
   - Enables consistent decision-making over time despite team changes
   - Helps prevent "decision amnesia" and repeated evaluation of settled issues
   - Facilitates onboarding of new team members with documented context
   - Supports learning from past decisions by tracking outcomes against expectations

5. **Stakeholder perspective mapping**: Visualize and track different viewpoints on product direction.
   - Essential for balancing competing interests from sales, marketing, engineering, and customers
   - Enables identification of alignment opportunities across different stakeholders
   - Helps anticipate potential resistance to proposed changes
   - Facilitates stakeholder management through better understanding of varied perspectives
   - Supports consensus building by clarifying areas of agreement and disagreement

## Technical Requirements

- Decision trees and prioritization logic must produce consistent, verifiable results

### Performance Expectations
- Feedback clustering should process 1000+ user comments in under 3 seconds
- Feature prioritization calculations should complete for 200+ features in under 1 second
- Competitive analysis comparisons should handle 20+ competitors with 100+ attributes each
- Full-text search across all product knowledge should return results in under 1 second
- System should remain responsive with 10,000+ knowledge items across all categories

### Integration Points
- Plain text and Markdown file system storage

   - Identify high-impact user pain points and feature requests

2. **Strategic Objective Framework**
   - Define and track product vision, goals, and strategic initiatives
   - Create hierarchical objective structures with measurable outcomes
   - Link product capabilities to specific business objectives
   - Track goal achievement and strategic alignment
   - Visualize strategy trees and dependency relationships

3. **Feature Prioritization Engine**
   - Implement multiple prioritization models (value/effort, RICE, Kano, etc.)
   - Calculate priority scores based on configurable criteria
   - Compare feature value across different prioritization frameworks
   - Visualize priority distributions across the feature portfolio
   - Track priority changes over time as market and strategy evolve

4. **Competitive Analysis Framework**
   - Track competitor products and their capabilities
   - Map feature parity and differentiation across the market
   - Document competitor pricing, positioning, and market share
   - Track competitive landscape changes over time
   - Identify whitespace opportunities and emerging threats

5. **Decision Management System**
   - Document product decisions with full context and rationale
   - Link decisions to supporting evidence and stakeholder input
   - Track decision outcomes and retrospective analysis
   - Maintain decision trees showing alternatives considered
   - Create searchable decision logs for organizational learning

6. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Map stakeholder roles, influence, and primary concerns
   - Track stakeholder feedback and perspective evolution
   - Identify alignment opportunities and potential conflicts
   - Manage communication preferences and engagement history
   - Visualize stakeholder relationships and influence networks

7. **Knowledge Discovery**
