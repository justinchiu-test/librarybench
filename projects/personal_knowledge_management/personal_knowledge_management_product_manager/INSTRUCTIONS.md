# ProductBrain: Knowledge Management System for Product Managers

## Overview
ProductBrain is a specialized personal knowledge management system designed for product managers who need to track user feedback, competitive analysis, feature requests, and strategic decisions to effectively guide product development and stakeholder communication.

## Persona Description
Sophia oversees a complex software product with multiple stakeholders, feature requests, and market research inputs. She needs to track user feedback, competitive analysis, and strategic decisions to guide product development.

## Key Requirements
1. **Customer feedback clustering**: Automatically group similar requests, complaints, and pain points to identify patterns and prioritize product improvements. This capability is essential for transforming hundreds of individual feedback points into actionable insights, identifying the most impactful areas for development, and ensuring customer needs drive product decisions.

2. **Feature prioritization framework**: Link customer requests and business requirements to strategic objectives, creating a structured approach to development planning. This framework helps Sophia make defensible prioritization decisions, balance competing stakeholder priorities, and align the product roadmap with company strategy and customer needs.

3. **Competitive intelligence tracking**: Monitor market positioning by tracking competitor features, strengths, and weaknesses relative to the product. This ongoing competitive analysis enables strategic positioning decisions, helps identify market gaps and opportunities, and ensures the product maintains competitive differentiation in rapidly evolving markets.

4. **Decision documentation**: Preserve the context, considerations, and rationale behind product choices to maintain organizational memory. This historical record of decision-making provides continuity through team changes, enables learning from past successes and failures, and helps explain the evolution of the product to new team members and stakeholders.

5. **Stakeholder perspective mapping**: Track different viewpoints on product direction from executives, customers, developers, and other key groups. This comprehensive view of stakeholder positions helps manage competing priorities, identify potential conflicts early, and develop communication strategies that address the concerns of all involved parties.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - All clustering algorithms must be independently testable with predefined datasets
  - Prioritization frameworks must be validated for consistency and alignment with strategic goals
  - Competitive tracking must be verifiable against known market conditions
  - Decision documentation must preserve all contextual information for future reference
  - Stakeholder perspective tracking must accurately represent diverse viewpoints

- **Performance expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle 10,000+ individual feedback items
  - Clustering operations should process 1,000 feedback items in under 30 seconds
  - Prioritization calculations should complete in under 5 seconds for 200+ feature requests
  - Search across all product knowledge should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Data visualizations should render in under 3 seconds for complex relationship maps

- **Integration points**:
  - Plain text and Markdown file support
  - Structured data import/export (CSV, JSON)
  - Version control for evolving product knowledge
  - Tagging and categorization system
  - Linking between different knowledge domains (feedback, features, decisions)

- **Key constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in accessible, plain-text formats
  - No dependency on external web services for core functionality
  - Must support offline operation
  - Must maintain historical records of evolving product knowledge
  - Must be usable without lengthy training or complex configuration

## Core Functionality
The system must implement a comprehensive knowledge management foundation with specialized features for product management:

1. **Feedback Management System**:
   - Import and categorize customer feedback from multiple sources
   - Apply clustering algorithms to identify common themes and patterns
   - Track feedback volume and sentiment over time
   - Link feedback to specific product features and components

2. **Feature and Requirement Organization**:
   - Create structured representations of product features and requirements
   - Link features to supporting business cases and customer needs
   - Apply prioritization frameworks with customizable criteria
   - Track feature dependencies and implementation sequencing

3. **Competitive Analysis Framework**:
   - Create profiles of key competitors with feature comparisons
   - Track market positioning across key product dimensions
   - Monitor competitive moves and industry trends
   - Identify strategic opportunities and threats

4. **Decision Management System**:
   - Document product decisions with full context and rationale
   - Track decision outcomes and effectiveness over time
   - Link decisions to supporting data and stakeholder input
   - Maintain searchable history of product evolution

5. **Stakeholder Communication Management**:
   - Track stakeholder information and communication preferences
   - Document different perspectives on product priorities
   - Identify areas of alignment and conflict among stakeholders
   - Generate stakeholder-specific reports and communications

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must be thoroughly testable with comprehensive pytest coverage:

- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Feedback clustering correctly identifies related customer inputs
  - Prioritization framework produces consistent results aligned with strategic goals
  - Competitive tracking accurately represents market positioning
  - Decision documentation captures all required contextual information
  - Stakeholder perspective mapping reflects diverse viewpoints

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Processing a large batch of customer feedback to identify key themes
  - Applying prioritization frameworks to evaluate competing feature requests
  - Conducting competitive analysis across multiple product dimensions
  - Documenting complex product decisions with full context and rationale
  - Mapping and analyzing conflicting stakeholder perspectives

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Sub-second response time for most knowledge retrieval operations
  - Clustering of 1,000 feedback items in under 30 seconds
  - Generation of prioritized feature lists in under 5 seconds
  - Memory-efficient operation suitable for standard laptop environments

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Contradictory feedback from different customer segments
  - Incomplete or subjective competitive information
  - Evolving strategic priorities affecting historical prioritization
  - Conflicting stakeholder perspectives with no clear resolution path
  - Very large feedback datasets with ambiguous clustering patterns

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
  - 100% coverage of clustering and prioritization functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive integration tests
  - All error handling paths must be explicitly tested

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when it demonstrably:

1. Transforms large volumes of customer feedback into actionable insights through effective clustering
2. Provides a consistent, strategy-aligned framework for feature prioritization decisions
3. Maintains current and accurate competitive positioning information across key product dimensions
4. Preserves complete decision context including considerations, alternatives, and rationale
5. Accurately tracks diverse stakeholder perspectives while highlighting areas of alignment and conflict
6. Performs efficiently with large collections containing thousands of feedback items and feature requests
7. Preserves all data in accessible formats that ensure long-term availability
8. Passes all specified tests with the required code coverage metrics
