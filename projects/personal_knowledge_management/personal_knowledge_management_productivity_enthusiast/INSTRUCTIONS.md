# GrowthVault - Personal Development Knowledge Management System

## Overview
GrowthVault is a specialized personal knowledge management system designed for personal development enthusiasts. It helps users capture, organize, and implement insights from diverse learning sources such as books, podcasts, articles, and courses. The system focuses on transforming passive knowledge into actionable insights, tracking implementation through habit formation, and aligning information with personal values and priorities.

## Persona Description
Marcus is committed to continuous personal improvement, collecting insights from books, podcasts, articles, and courses. He needs to integrate diverse learning inputs into an actionable personal development system.

## Key Requirements

1. **Actionable insight extraction** - Automatically identify key takeaways from learning materials, distinguishing between theoretical concepts and practical action items. This feature is critical for Marcus because it helps him focus on implementing knowledge rather than just collecting it, transforming the multitude of resources he consumes into concrete steps he can take to improve his life.

2. **Habit tracking** - Connect knowledge acquisition with behavior implementation by linking insights to specific habit formation goals with progress tracking. This feature addresses Marcus's need to bridge the gap between learning and doing, ensuring that the valuable information he collects actually translates into behavioral changes and skills development in his daily life.

3. **Personal values alignment** - Categorize and filter information by life priority areas (health, relationships, career, etc.) to ensure knowledge acquisition aligns with personal goals. This feature is essential for Marcus to maintain focus on what truly matters to him, preventing information overwhelm and ensuring that his learning efforts contribute directly to his most important life priorities and values.

4. **Learning source comparison** - Identify where different authorities agree or conflict on specific topics, highlighting consensus views versus contested ideas. This feature helps Marcus develop a more nuanced understanding of personal development topics by recognizing patterns across different sources, identifying highly validated principles from multiple experts versus more speculative or controversial approaches.

5. **Progressive summarization** - Distill lengthy materials into increasingly condensed forms through multiple layers of highlighting and synthesis. This feature addresses Marcus's challenge of information overload by creating a systematic approach to refining raw content into concise, high-value summaries that capture essential points while progressively removing less relevant details, making review and implementation more efficient.

## Technical Requirements

   - Recognize value-alignment indicators
   - Tag content with relevant life areas

3. **Progressive Summarization Engine**
   - Support multi-layer highlighting of content
   - Generate automated first-layer highlights based on insight extraction
   - Provide mechanisms for manual highlighting refinement
   - Create distilled summaries from highlighted content
   - Maintain original context links for each summary layer

4. **Source Comparison Framework**
   - Track assertions and recommendations by source
   - Identify agreement and conflict patterns across sources
   - Calculate consensus scores for specific principles
   - Map intellectual lineages between sources
   - Generate comparative views on specific topics

5. **Habit Development System**
   - Link actionable insights to specific habit formation goals
   - Track implementation progress over time
   - Provide spaced repetition of relevant insights during habit formation
   - Calculate success metrics for knowledge implementation
   - Identify knowledge areas lacking implementation

6. **Personal Values Alignment**
   - Define and manage personal value categories
   - Auto-categorize content by relevance to defined values
   - Filter and prioritize content based on value alignment
   - Identify imbalances in knowledge collection relative to stated values
   - Generate focused knowledge collections for specific life areas
