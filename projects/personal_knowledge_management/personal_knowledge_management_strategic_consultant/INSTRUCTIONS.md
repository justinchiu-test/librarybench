   - Capture lessons learned and methodology improvements
   - Analyze success factors and failure points
   - Generate engagement retrospectives with actionable insights

6. **Anonymization Pipeline**
   - Identify and remove client-specific identifying information
   - Transform confidential details while preserving insight value
   - Generate teaching cases from actual engagements
   - Verify anonymization completeness before sharing
   - Create shareable knowledge with appropriate abstraction levels

7. **Knowledge Discovery**
