# DocBrain - A Knowledge Management System for Technical Documentation Specialists

## Overview
DocBrain is a specialized knowledge management system designed for technical documentation specialists who need to track API changes, document user workflows, and maintain implementation details while ensuring accuracy and accessibility for different user types. The system enables documentation professionals to link content directly to code, manage version-specific information, create audience-appropriate views, identify documentation gaps, and map user journeys.

## Persona Description
Priya creates and maintains documentation for complex software systems, tracking API changes, user workflows, and implementation details. She needs to ensure technical accuracy while creating accessible knowledge structures for different user types.

## Key Requirements
1. **Code reference linking** - Develop a robust system for connecting documentation with actual implementation code. This capability is essential for Priya to maintain documentation accuracy as codebases evolve, verify that technical descriptions match current implementations, and provide developers with direct paths between documentation and relevant code. The linking must be bidirectional, allowing navigation from code to documentation and vice versa, while supporting version-specific references.

2. **Version-aware content** - Create a sophisticated framework for tracking how functionality changes across software releases. This feature allows Priya to document different behaviors in specific software versions, support users across multiple releases simultaneously, and maintain a historical record of feature evolution. The version awareness must extend to all documentation elements, from high-level concepts to specific API details.

3. **Audience-based views** - Implement a flexible system for presenting information appropriate for different technical levels. This functionality helps Priya tailor content to diverse user personas, avoid overwhelming beginners with advanced details while providing experts with necessary technical depth, and maintain a single source of truth that can be filtered based on audience needs. The views must support configurable complexity levels and terminology adaptation.

4. **Documentation gap analysis** - Design tools for systematically identifying undocumented features or workflows. This capability enables Priya to ensure comprehensive coverage of the product functionality, prioritize documentation efforts for maximum impact, and track documentation completeness across the entire system. The gap analysis should integrate with actual code and product features to identify missing documentation.

5. **User journey mapping** - Create mechanisms for showing how documentation elements connect in task completion sequences. This feature helps Priya organize documentation around real user goals, ensure that task flows are completely documented from start to finish, and identify areas where existing documentation creates confusion in multi-step processes. The journey mapping should support diverse user goals and experience levels.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All functionality must be implemented through well-defined APIs
  - Code linking must be verifiable against actual codebases
  - Version tracking must support validation against release histories
  - Audience differentiation must be testable with defined persona parameters
  - Gap detection must be verifiable against known feature inventories
  - User journey completeness must be objectively measurable

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle repositories with 10,000+ documentation pages
  - Code reference resolution must complete in under 500ms
  - Version comparison operations must process in under 2 seconds
  - Audience view filtering must generate results in under 1 second
  - Gap analysis must evaluate entire documentation sets against code bases in under 60 seconds
  - Full-text search across all content must return results in under 2 seconds

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for common programming language parsing (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
  - Compatibility with source control systems for version tracking
  - Integration with code analysis tools for feature detection
  - Export capabilities for documentation in various formats (Markdown, JSON, etc.)
  - Import framework for existing documentation from common formats

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All data must be stored in plain text formats for maximum portability
  - No user interface components - all functionality exposed through APIs
  - Implementation must be language-agnostic for code reference support
  - System must operate efficiently with large codebases (millions of lines)
  - Support for distributed documentation across multiple repositories

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
DocBrain needs to implement these core capabilities:

1. **Code Reference System**: A sophisticated framework for code-to-documentation linking:
   - Language-specific code parsing and structure recognition
   - Bidirectional reference mapping between code and documentation
   - Reference validation and staleness detection
   - Source code change monitoring for documentation impact
   - Link persistence across code refactoring

2. **Version Control Integration**: A system for managing documentation across releases:
   - Release-specific content management
   - Differential documentation highlighting changes between versions
   - Feature timeline tracking across multiple releases
   - Deprecation and introduction markers for changing functionality
   - Compatibility matrices for version-specific behaviors

3. **Audience Management Framework**: A flexible system for content targeting:
   - Audience persona definition with technical level parameters
   - Content complexity classification and tagging
   - Conditional content inclusion based on audience targets
   - Terminology adaptation for different expertise levels
   - Reading level analysis for content accessibility

4. **Coverage Analysis Engine**: A comprehensive gap detection system:
   - Feature inventory extraction from codebase
   - Documentation completeness scoring against feature set
   - Automated detection of undocumented APIs and parameters
   - Priority ranking for documentation gaps based on usage patterns
   - Workflow coverage verification for end-to-end processes

5. **User Journey Orchestration**: A framework for task-based documentation organization:
   - Task flow definition with sequence modeling
   - Documentation completeness verification for all task steps
   - Cross-reference management between related tasks
   - Prerequisite and dependency tracking for complex workflows
   - Alternative path documentation for different approaches to goals

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive tests that verify all aspects of the system:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Code reference linking correctly connects documentation with implementation code
  - Version-aware content accurately tracks functionality changes across software releases
  - Audience-based views appropriately filter information for different technical levels
  - Documentation gap analysis effectively identifies undocumented features or workflows
  - User journey mapping successfully shows documentation connections in task flows

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Linking a new API documentation page to its implementation code
  - Documenting how a feature's behavior changes between three software versions
  - Creating beginner, intermediate, and expert views of a complex technical concept
  - Analyzing a codebase to identify priority documentation gaps
  - Mapping documentation requirements for a multi-step user workflow

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Code reference system must process a codebase with 500,000+ lines in under 120 seconds
  - Version comparison must analyze differences across 50+ releases in under 30 seconds
  - Audience view generation must filter 1,000+ pages for a specific persona in under 5 seconds
  - Gap analysis must evaluate documentation coverage for 1,000+ API endpoints in under 60 seconds
  - User journey mapping must verify documentation completeness for 100+ workflows in under 30 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:

  - Managing version documentation for hotfixes and non-standard release cycles
  - Creating appropriate content for extreme audience variations (child vs. PhD)
  - Detecting documentation gaps in newly added experimental features
  - Mapping user journeys that span multiple systems or external integrations

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all core modules
  - 100% coverage for code reference resolution logic
  - 95% coverage for version differentiation functionality
  - 95% branch coverage for audience filtering mechanisms
  - 100% coverage for gap detection algorithms

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. Documentation specialists can create and maintain bidirectional links between documentation and code
2. Content can be tracked and presented appropriately for different software versions
3. Information can be filtered and adapted for users with varying technical expertise
4. Undocumented features and workflows can be systematically identified
5. Documentation elements can be organized and verified according to user task flows

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

To set up the development environment:
1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL REMINDER: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY for project completion:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
