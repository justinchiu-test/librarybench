# DocuBrain: Knowledge Management System for Technical Documentation Specialists

## Overview
DocuBrain is a specialized personal knowledge management system designed for technical documentation specialists who need to track software changes, maintain accurate API references, create multi-audience documentation, and ensure comprehensive coverage of features and workflows while managing documentation across multiple versions.

## Persona Description
Priya creates and maintains documentation for complex software systems, tracking API changes, user workflows, and implementation details. She needs to ensure technical accuracy while creating accessible knowledge structures for different user types.

## Key Requirements
1. **Code reference linking**: Create bidirectional connections between documentation and actual implementation code, ensuring documentation accuracy and facilitating updates when code changes. This feature is essential for maintaining technical precision in documentation, reducing drift between code and documentation over time, and helping developers understand the relationship between user-facing descriptions and implementation details.

2. **Version-aware content**: Track how functionality changes across software releases, maintaining accurate documentation for all supported versions. This capability ensures users can access correct information for their specific software version, allows documentation of deprecated features with appropriate warnings, and helps track the evolution of features through multiple releases.

3. **Audience-based views**: Present information with appropriate depth and terminology for different technical levels, from novice users to expert developers. This adaptive approach ensures documentation serves diverse user needs, presents technical concepts at appropriate levels of abstraction for different audiences, and provides navigation paths suited to various levels of expertise.

4. **Documentation gap analysis**: Identify undocumented features, APIs, or workflows, ensuring comprehensive coverage across the software system. This systematic approach to documentation completeness helps prioritize documentation work, ensures critical functionality doesn't remain undocumented, and provides metrics on documentation coverage for project management.

5. **User journey mapping**: Show how documentation elements connect in supporting task completion, creating cohesive pathways through complex systems. This task-oriented organization helps users find related documentation that supports complete workflows, ensures documentation structure matches actual use patterns, and identifies areas where documentation connections need strengthening.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**:
  - Code-documentation linking must be verifiable against actual codebase
  - Version tracking must be validated across multiple software releases
  - Audience view generation must be testable for different user personas
  - Gap analysis must be verifiable against product feature inventory
  - User journey mapping must be validated against actual task workflows

- **Performance expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle documentation for complex systems with 10,000+ API endpoints
  - Code linking verification should process 1,000+ reference points per minute
  - Audience view generation should complete in under 3 seconds
  - Full-text search across all documentation should return results in under 2 seconds
  - Gap analysis should complete for entire system in under 5 minutes

- **Integration points**:
  - Plain text and Markdown file support
  - Code parsing and analysis capabilities
  - Version control system integration
  - Release management tracking
  - User workflow modeling

- **Key constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in accessible, plain-text formats
  - No dependency on external web services for core functionality
  - Must support offline operation
  - Must maintain compatibility with standard documentation formats
  - Must scale to handle documentation for enterprise-scale software systems

## Core Functionality
The system must implement a comprehensive knowledge management foundation with specialized features for technical documentation:

1. **Technical Content Management**:
   - Create and organize documentation in modular, reusable components
   - Support rich formatting and technical notation
   - Implement document versioning and comparison
   - Track documentation status and review state

2. **Code Integration Framework**:
   - Parse and analyze codebase for documentable elements
   - Link documentation directly to specific code locations
   - Track code changes that may impact documentation
   - Verify documentation accuracy against current implementation

3. **Versioning and Release Management**:
   - Track documentation across multiple software versions
   - Identify version-specific features and behaviors
   - Manage documentation for deprecated and new functionality
   - Generate version-appropriate documentation compilations

4. **Audience and Usability System**:
   - Define audience personas with technical characteristics
   - Create content appropriate for different expertise levels
   - Generate audience-specific navigation paths
   - Adapt terminology and detail level based on audience needs

5. **Documentation Quality Assurance**:
   - Assess documentation coverage against product features
   - Identify gaps in documentation of APIs, features, or workflows
   - Track user journey completeness through documentation
   - Generate documentation quality metrics and reports

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must be thoroughly testable with comprehensive pytest coverage:

- **Key functionalities that must be verified**:
  - Code reference linking correctly connects documentation to implementation
  - Version-aware content tracking accurately reflects changes across releases
  - Audience-based views properly adjust content for different technical levels
  - Documentation gap analysis correctly identifies undocumented elements
  - User journey mapping effectively connects related documentation components

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**:
  - Updating documentation in response to code changes
  - Managing documentation across multiple software versions
  - Generating appropriate documentation views for different user types
  - Identifying and addressing documentation coverage gaps
  - Creating coherent documentation pathways for complete user tasks

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**:
  - Sub-second response time for most documentation retrieval operations
  - Efficient handling of documentation for large software systems
  - Responsive generation of different audience views
  - Memory-efficient operation suitable for standard laptop environments

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**:
  - Undocumented or poorly documented code
  - Major breaking changes between software versions
  - Content that must serve audiences with vastly different technical backgrounds
  - Complex workflows spanning multiple system components
  - Rapid code changes requiring frequent documentation updates

- **Required test coverage metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
  - 100% coverage of code linking and version management functionality
  - All public APIs must have comprehensive integration tests
  - All error handling paths must be explicitly tested

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when it demonstrably:

1. Maintains accurate bidirectional links between documentation and implementation code
2. Properly tracks documentation across multiple software versions with appropriate version-specific content
3. Generates effective documentation views customized for different audience technical levels
4. Accurately identifies gaps in documentation coverage across the software system
5. Creates coherent pathway connections between documentation elements supporting complete user workflows
6. Performs efficiently with large documentation sets for complex software systems
7. Preserves all data in accessible formats that ensure long-term availability
8. Passes all specified tests with the required code coverage metrics
