# Educational Analytics Query Interpreter

A specialized query language interpreter for education research with support for cohort comparisons, assessment standardization, longitudinal tracking, intervention analysis, and privacy-preserving aggregation.

## Overview

This project implements a query language interpreter designed specifically for educational data research. It allows researchers to query anonymized educational records across different learning interventions while preserving student privacy. The interpreter includes cohort comparison operators, educational measurement standardization, longitudinal tracking, intervention effectiveness scoring, and demographic data protectionâ€”essential features for conducting ethical and effective educational research.

## Persona Description

Dr. Patel studies student performance patterns across different learning interventions. She needs to query anonymized educational records with complex relationships while preserving student privacy.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cohort Comparison Operators**
   - Implement specialized operators for comparing student groups across different dimensions
   - Support statistical significance testing between cohorts (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.)
   - Enable demographic matching and balancing between comparison groups
   - Include visualization-ready output formats for cohort differences
   - Critical for Dr. Patel to identify meaningful differences between student groups exposed to different interventions, teaching methods, or learning environments

2. **Educational Measurement Standardization**
   - Convert scores across different assessment systems to comparable scales
   - Support various standardization methods (z-scores, percentiles, grade equivalents)
   - Enable equating between different test versions or assessment approaches
   - Include confidence intervals for standardized measurements
   - Essential for comparing student performance across different classes, schools, or assessment systems with differing grading scales or evaluation methods

3. **Longitudinal Tracking**
   - Follow student progress through multiple academic terms or years
   - Support growth modeling and trajectory analysis
   - Enable time-based pattern detection in student performance
   - Include methods for handling student transfers and missing assessment periods
   - Crucial for analyzing student development over time and understanding the long-term impact of educational interventions beyond immediate outcomes

4. **Intervention Effectiveness Scoring**
   - Correlate educational outcomes with specific programs or teaching methods
   - Support various effectiveness metrics (effect size, improvement percentage, etc.)
   - Enable multi-factor analysis of intervention impacts
   - Include controls for confounding variables in effectiveness assessment
   - Important for objectively measuring which educational interventions produce meaningful results and under what circumstances, helping prioritize effective approaches

5. **Demographic Data Protection**
   - Automatically apply statistical aggregation for small groups to prevent re-identification
   - Implement k-anonymity and differential privacy techniques
   - Support role-based access controls for sensitive demographic information
   - Include audit logging of all queries against protected data
   - Critical for maintaining student privacy while still enabling meaningful demographic analysis, ensuring research complies with educational privacy regulations

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Cohort comparison operators must produce consistent results with known test datasets
- Standardization methods must convert between scales accurately for verification
- Longitudinal tracking must correctly follow synthetic student trajectories
- Intervention scoring must produce expected results for controlled test cases
- Privacy protection must demonstrably prevent re-identification in test scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Process cohort comparisons for up to 100,000 students in under 60 seconds
- Handle longitudinal data spanning 10+ years for 50,000+ students
- Complete standardization conversions at a rate of 10,000 assessments per second
- Calculate intervention effectiveness metrics for 100+ interventions in under 30 seconds
- Apply privacy protections with less than 10% query overhead

### Integration Points
- Import data from student information systems and learning management systems
- Support for educational data interchange formats (Ed-Fi, CEDS, etc.)
- Export capabilities to statistical analysis packages
- Integration with visualization libraries for research presentation
- Support for secure data sharing between research institutions

### Key Constraints
- Must strictly adhere to educational privacy regulations (FERPA, etc.)
- No individual student data should be exposed in query results
- All operations must maintain data provenance for research validity
- System must operate without exposing sensitive data to third-party services
- Must support secure multi-institutional research collaborations

   - Manage student identifiers and linkages
   - Support anonymization and de-identification
   - Maintain cohort and group definitions

2. **Statistical Analysis Engine**
   - Implement education-specific statistical methods
   - Calculate group comparisons and significance
   - Support longitudinal statistical models
   - Provide confidence intervals and validation metrics

3. **Assessment Converter**
   - Transform between different grading systems
   - Implement score equating methodologies
   - Support calibration between assessment instruments
   - Manage assessment metadata and properties

4. **Privacy Protection System**
   - Apply k-anonymity to query results
   - Implement differential privacy techniques
   - Enforce minimum group size requirements
   - Log and audit privacy-sensitive operations

5. **Intervention Analysis Framework**
   - Correlate interventions with outcomes
   - Control for confounding factors
   - Calculate effectiveness metrics
   - Support multi-factor intervention analysis

## Testing Requirements
