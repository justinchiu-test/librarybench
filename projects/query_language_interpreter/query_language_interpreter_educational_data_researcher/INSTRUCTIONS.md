# Education Analytics Query Engine

A query language interpreter specialized for analyzing student performance while preserving privacy.

## Overview

The Education Analytics Query Engine provides a specialized query system for analyzing anonymized educational data across different learning interventions. This project variant focuses on enabling education researchers to query student performance patterns while preserving privacy, featuring cohort comparison, measurement standardization, longitudinal tracking, and demographic data protection.

## Persona Description

Dr. Patel studies student performance patterns across different learning interventions. She needs to query anonymized educational records with complex relationships while preserving student privacy.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cohort comparison operators highlighting differences between student groups**
   - Implement statistical comparison functions for student cohorts with different attributes
   - Support significance testing for performance differences between groups
   - Enable matching and stratification for proper experimental design
   - Provide effect size calculations and confidence intervals
   - Critical for Dr. Patel to rigorously compare outcomes between different intervention groups while controlling for confounding variables

2. **Educational measurement standardization across different assessment systems**
   - Develop methods for normalizing scores across different grading systems and scales
   - Implement IRT (Item Response Theory) models for equating different assessments
   - Support standard score conversions (percentiles, z-scores, T-scores, NCEs)
   - Enable custom scaling with preservation of distributional properties
   - Essential for comparing performance across different schools, districts, or assessment instruments that use different scoring systems

3. **Longitudinal tracking following student progress through multiple academic periods**
   - Create student-level tracking capabilities with anonymized persistent identifiers
   - Support growth modeling and trajectory analysis
   - Enable alignment of different time periods (semesters, years) for comparison
   - Provide proper handling of missing data in longitudinal sequences
   - Vital for understanding how interventions affect student growth over time rather than just at a single point

4. **Intervention effectiveness scoring correlating outcomes with specific programs**
   - Implement causal inference methods for estimating intervention effects
   - Support multiple impact measurement approaches (pre-post, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity)
   - Enable propensity score matching for quasi-experimental designs
   - Provide dose-response analysis for intervention intensity
   - Critical for determining which educational programs have meaningful impacts on student outcomes and warrant continued investment

5. **Demographic data protection with automatic statistical aggregation for small groups**
   - Develop privacy-preserving query methods that automatically protect small groups
   - Implement k-anonymity for demographic breakdowns
   - Support differential privacy techniques for sensitive analyses
   - Enable cell suppression and controlled rounding for tabular outputs
   - Important for allowing analysis by demographic factors while preventing re-identification of students in small demographic subgroups

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All statistical functions must be tested against reference implementations
- Test longitudinal tracking with synthetic student career data
- Verify privacy protection with dataset re-identification attacks
- Test intervention analysis with known effect sizes in simulated data
- Validate measurement standardization with cross-validation techniques

### Performance Expectations
- Process datasets covering up to 1 million students
- Support longitudinal analysis spanning up to 12 years of education

### Implementation Notes
IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Handle longitudinal records with proper temporal alignment
   - Manage assessment data with various scoring systems
   - Support intervention and program assignment tracking

2. **Query Language Processor**
   - Implement education-specific query syntax and semantics
   - Support privacy-preserving query transformation
   - Enable cohort definitions and comparison operations
   - Process longitudinal and cross-sectional queries appropriately

3. **Statistical Analysis Engine**
   - Implement education-specific statistical methods
   - Support proper techniques for clustered and nested data
   - Provide causal inference for intervention analysis
   - Enable growth modeling and trajectory analysis

4. **Measurement Framework**
   - Support score standardization and normalization
   - Implement psychometric models for assessment equivalence
   - Enable standard error handling for educational measurements
   - Provide reliability and validity metrics

5. **Privacy Protection System**
   - Enforce demographic data protection automatically
