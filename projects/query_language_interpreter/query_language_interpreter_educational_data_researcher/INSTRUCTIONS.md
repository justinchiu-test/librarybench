# Educational Analytics Query Language Interpreter

## Overview
This specialized Query Language Interpreter enables educational researchers to analyze anonymized student performance patterns across different learning interventions while preserving student privacy. The interpreter provides cohort comparison capabilities, educational measurement standardization, longitudinal tracking, intervention effectiveness scoring, and automatic demographic data protection, making it an ideal tool for evidence-based educational research.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel studies student performance patterns across different learning interventions. She needs to query anonymized educational records with complex relationships while preserving student privacy.

## Key Requirements
1. **Cohort comparison operators highlighting differences between student groups**: Provides specialized statistical functions for comparing performance metrics between different student cohorts (experimental vs. control groups, demographic segments, intervention groups), automatically computing significance tests and effect sizes to identify meaningful differences in educational outcomes.

2. **Educational measurement standardization across different assessment systems**: Includes algorithms for normalizing and standardizing scores from different assessment instruments, grading scales, and measurement approaches, enabling valid comparisons across different educational contexts, time periods, and measurement systems.

3. **Longitudinal tracking following student progress through multiple academic periods**: Enables tracking of individual student or cohort progress over time (across semesters, years, or educational transitions), with specialized functions for growth modeling, learning trajectory analysis, and developmental pattern identification.

4. **Intervention effectiveness scoring correlating outcomes with specific programs**: Implements analytical methods for evaluating educational intervention impacts, including pre/post comparisons, gain score analysis, and statistical controls for confounding variables, essential for determining which educational approaches are most effective for different student populations.

5. **Demographic data protection with automatic statistical aggregation for small groups**: Enforces privacy protections by automatically detecting and aggregating results from small demographic groups that could otherwise identify individual students, ensuring research complies with educational privacy regulations while still enabling valuable demographic analysis.

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- Cohort comparison statistics must be verified with known statistical distributions
- Measurement standardization must be tested against established psychometric methods
- Longitudinal tracking must be validated with multi-year educational datasets
- Intervention effectiveness calculations must be tested against published research methods
- Privacy protection mechanisms must be verified to prevent individual identification

### Performance Expectations
- Must efficiently handle educational datasets covering multiple years and institutions
- Statistical calculations should optimize for the specific analytical methods used
- Longitudinal queries should scale efficiently with the number of time periods
- Memory usage should remain reasonable even with large student populations
- Query response times should support interactive research exploration

### Integration Points
- Support for common educational data formats and standards
- Import capabilities from student information systems and learning management systems
- Export functionality for research publications and presentations
- Optional integration with statistical analysis tools
- Compliance with educational data interchange standards

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain FERPA compliance and other educational privacy regulations
- Implementation must protect against re-identification of anonymized student data
- All analyses must maintain statistical validity and accuracy
- System must handle the complex, nested relationships in educational data
- All educational measurement conversions must maintain psychometric integrity

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of cohort comparison statistics compared to standard statistical packages
- Correct standardization of educational measurements across different scales
- Proper tracking of longitudinal progress with various time patterns
- Accurate evaluation of intervention effectiveness using appropriate methods
- Effective protection of sensitive demographic data while preserving analysis value

### Critical User Scenarios
- Comparing performance between intervention and control groups across multiple measures
- Standardizing assessment results from different instruments for valid comparison
- Tracking student cohorts through multiple years to identify long-term impacts
- Evaluating the effectiveness of specific educational programs for different learners
- Analyzing demographic patterns while ensuring individual privacy protection

### Performance Benchmarks
- Cohort comparison operations should handle at least 100,000 student records efficiently
- Measurement standardization should process at least 50 different assessment types
- Longitudinal tracking should support at least 10 academic periods without performance degradation
- Intervention analysis should handle at least 50 simultaneous intervention variables
- System should maintain interactive response times (under 3 seconds) for typical research queries

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of incomplete or inconsistent student records
- Proper management of students who change cohorts or groups
- Appropriate treatment of outlier performance or unusual learning patterns
- Graceful handling of assessment data with different psychometric properties
- Behavior with extremely small demographic groups requiring privacy protection

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage for privacy protection and standardization functions
- All statistical methods must have dedicated test cases with known outcomes
- Longitudinal tracking must be tested with various educational timelines
- Demographic protection must be verified with challenging test cases

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation will:

1. Enable effective comparison between student cohorts with appropriate statistical methods, verified by tests against known statistical distributions
2. Successfully standardize measurements across different assessment systems, validated against established psychometric methods
3. Accurately track student progress through multiple academic periods, confirmed with test datasets spanning multiple years
4. Properly evaluate intervention effectiveness using appropriate analytical methods, verified with published research examples
5. Effectively protect demographic data while maintaining analytical value, demonstrated through privacy protection tests

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
