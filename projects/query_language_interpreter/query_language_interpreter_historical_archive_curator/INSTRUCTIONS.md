# Historical Collections Query Language Interpreter

## Overview
This specialized Query Language Interpreter enables archivists and historians to effectively query across heterogeneous collections of historical documents, photographs, and artifacts with complex and often incomplete metadata. The interpreter provides fuzzy matching capabilities, temporal uncertainty handling, provenance chain querying, cross-collection joins, and confidence scoring, making it an ideal tool for discovering connections and patterns in historical archives.

## Persona Description
Eleanor digitizes and organizes historical documents, photographs, and artifacts with complex metadata. She needs to query across heterogeneous collections with varying attributes and incomplete information.

## Key Requirements
1. **Fuzzy matching operators tolerant of historical spelling variations and transcription errors**: Provides sophisticated fuzzy text matching that accounts for historical spelling variations, common transcription errors, OCR mistakes, and alternative name forms, enabling successful searches despite inconsistencies in how names, places, and terms were recorded across different historical sources.

2. **Temporal uncertainty handling for items with estimated or range-based dates**: Supports flexible date representations including ranges, approximations (circa), seasons, partial dates (month/year only), and different calendar systems, allowing meaningful queries despite the inherent date uncertainty in historical records where precise dates are often unknown.

3. **Provenance chain querying showing acquisition history and authentication evidence**: Enables tracking and querying the complete ownership and authentication history of items, allowing archivists to establish item legitimacy, trace the history of collection development, and identify potential connections between donors or collecting expeditions.

4. **Cross-collection joins connecting items related by historical figures or events**: Facilitates discovery of relationships between items across different collections based on connections to the same historical people, places, events, or themes, essential for creating comprehensive historical narratives that span multiple collection types.

5. **Confidence scoring indicating reliability of result matches based on metadata quality**: Provides automated assessment of the reliability of query results based on metadata completeness, source credibility, verification status, and corroborating evidence, helping researchers prioritize findings and understand the relative certainty of different potential matches.

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- Fuzzy matching algorithms must be tested with known historical text variations
- Temporal handling must be verified with various uncertain date representations
- Provenance chain operations must be tested with complex ownership histories
- Cross-collection joins must be validated with items having known relationships
- Confidence scoring must be tested against expert-rated example cases

### Performance Expectations
- Must handle collections containing millions of items with reasonable response times
- Fuzzy matching should strike an optimal balance between recall and precision
- Complex queries joining multiple collections should return initial results within 5 seconds
- Memory usage should scale efficiently with collection size
- Index structures should optimize for the specific challenges of historical data

### Integration Points
- Support for common metadata standards (Dublin Core, MODS, EAD, etc.)
- Import capabilities for standard archive export formats
- Integration with digital asset management systems
- Export functionality for research findings and exhibition planning
- Optional integration with visualization tools for relationship mapping

### Key Constraints
- Must accommodate extremely heterogeneous metadata across different collection types
- Should handle the uncertainty and incompleteness inherent in historical records
- Must preserve original metadata while enabling normalized searching
- Should support multilingual collections with varying character sets
- Must operate effectively with limited computational resources typical in cultural institutions

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of fuzzy matching for historical text with known variations
- Correct handling of various uncertain date formats and ranges
- Proper traversal and querying of provenance chains
- Accurate identification of relationships across different collections
- Appropriate confidence scoring that correlates with expert assessments

### Critical User Scenarios
- Searching for historical figures across collections with name variations
- Finding items related to events with uncertain or approximate dates
- Tracing the provenance history of significant artifacts
- Discovering connections between items across different collection types
- Assessing the reliability of potential matches for research purposes

### Performance Benchmarks
- Fuzzy matching should achieve at least 90% accuracy against a test corpus of historical name variations
- Temporal queries should correctly handle at least 95% of test cases with uncertain dates
- Provenance chain operations should process collections with up to 20 transfer events per item
- Cross-collection joins should handle at least 10 different collection types simultaneously
- System should scale to manage at least 5 million catalog records with acceptable performance

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of extremely sparse or inconsistent metadata
- Behavior with conflicting temporal information
- Appropriate treatment of broken provenance chains
- Graceful handling of multilingual text with mixed character sets
- Correct operation with extremely old or unusual date formats

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage for fuzzy matching and temporal comparison functions
- All confidence scoring algorithms must have dedicated test cases
- Cross-collection join operations must be tested with various metadata schema combinations
- All supported date formats and uncertainty representations must be explicitly tested

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation will:

1. Effectively match historical text despite spelling variations and transcription errors, verified by tests with known historical text variants
2. Correctly handle uncertain and range-based dates, validated through test cases with various temporal representations
3. Properly track and query item provenance chains, demonstrated through tests with complex ownership histories
4. Successfully identify relationships between items across different collections, confirmed with test cases of known related items
5. Accurately score the confidence of potential matches based on metadata quality, verified against expert-rated examples
