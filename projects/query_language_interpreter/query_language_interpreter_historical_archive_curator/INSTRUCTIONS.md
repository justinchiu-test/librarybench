# Historical Archive Query Engine

A query language interpreter specialized for historical collections with complex metadata and uncertain information.

## Overview

The Historical Archive Query Engine provides a specialized query system for digitized historical documents, photographs, and artifacts with complex metadata. This project variant focuses on enabling archivists to query across heterogeneous collections with varying attributes and incomplete information, featuring fuzzy matching, temporal uncertainty handling, provenance tracking, and confidence scoring.

## Persona Description

Eleanor digitizes and organizes historical documents, photographs, and artifacts with complex metadata. She needs to query across heterogeneous collections with varying attributes and incomplete information.

## Key Requirements

1. **Fuzzy matching operators tolerant of historical spelling variations and transcription errors**
   - Implement phonetic matching algorithms (Soundex, Metaphone, etc.) for historical names
   - Support edit distance measures with customizable thresholds
   - Enable language-specific and historical spelling variation awareness
   - Provide specialized fuzzy matching for dates, places, and proper names
   - Critical for Eleanor to find relevant items despite inconsistent spellings, transcription variations, and historical language differences

2. **Temporal uncertainty handling for items with estimated or range-based dates**
   - Develop date representations supporting ranges, approximations, and uncertain dates
   - Implement operators for querying with awareness of temporal uncertainty
   - Support various historical calendar systems and date formats
   - Enable chronological sorting and filtering with uncertainty awareness
   - Essential for working with historical collections where exact dates are often unknown or approximate

3. **Provenance chain querying showing acquisition history and authentication evidence**
   - Create data structures for representing item ownership and transfer history
   - Implement path queries for tracing provenance chains
   - Support evidence strength assessment and source credibility tracking
   - Enable queries based on provenance attributes and relationships
   - Vital for establishing item authenticity, tracking acquisition history, and supporting scholarly research on collection items

4. **Cross-collection joins connecting items related by historical figures or events**
   - Develop specialized join operations for heterogeneous collection metadata
   - Support entity resolution across different naming conventions and identifiers
   - Enable relationship discovery between items in different collections
   - Provide contextual awareness of historical relationships and associations
   - Important for discovering connections between items across disparate collections that may reference the same historical figures, locations, or events

5. **Confidence scoring indicating reliability of result matches based on metadata quality**
   - Implement multi-factor confidence assessment algorithms
   - Support customizable weighting of different evidence types
   - Enable confidence thresholds and sorting in query results
   - Provide detailed explanation of confidence calculations
   - Critical for transparently communicating the reliability of query results based on metadata completeness, source quality, and match certainty

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All functions must be unit-testable with pytest
- Test fuzzy matching algorithms against historical text corpora
- Verify temporal uncertainty handling with various date formats and calendar systems
- Test provenance chain querying with complex ownership histories
- Validate confidence scoring against manually assessed reference cases

### Performance Expectations
- Support catalogs with at least 10 million items
- Execute common fuzzy matching queries in under 3 seconds
- Process cross-collection joins involving 100,000+ items in under 10 seconds
- Scale linearly with collection size for most operations
- Maintain interactive query response times for catalog browsing

### Integration Points
- Import metadata from standard archival formats (EAD, MARC, Dublin Core)
- Connect with digital asset management systems
- Support export to cultural heritage data exchange formats
- Interface with authority databases for names, places, and subjects
- Provide compatibility with scholarly research tools

### Key Constraints
- Handle extremely heterogeneous metadata across different collection types
- Support very sparse metadata where many fields may be unknown
- Process multilingual content and historical language variations
- Maintain scholarly rigor in uncertainty representation
- Balance precision and recall appropriately for historical research needs

### Implementation Notes
IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Historical Archive Query Engine must implement the following core functionality:

1. **Archival Metadata Management**
   - Handle diverse metadata schemas across different collection types
   - Support flexible attribute sets varying by item type
   - Manage controlled vocabularies and authority records
   - Enable metadata quality assessment and enhancement

2. **Historical Query Language Processor**
   - Implement query syntax with special operators for historical data
   - Support fuzzy matching and uncertainty-aware operations
   - Enable confidence-based filtering and sorting
   - Provide specialized functions for common archival queries

3. **Temporal Reasoning Engine**
   - Represent and normalize dates with uncertainty
   - Implement temporal operators aware of date approximations
   - Support historical calendar systems and conversions
   - Enable chronological operations with imprecise dates

4. **Entity Resolution Framework**
   - Maintain identity resolution for historical figures, places, and events
   - Support name variants and contextual disambiguation
   - Implement cross-collection entity matching
   - Enable relationship discovery and network analysis

5. **Provenance and Confidence Assessment**
   - Track ownership and custody chains
   - Evaluate evidence quality and source reliability
   - Calculate multi-factor confidence scores
   - Support scholarly attribution and citation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of fuzzy matching algorithms for historical names and text
- Correct handling of temporal uncertainty in searches and sorting
- Proper traversal and analysis of provenance chains
- Accurate cross-collection joining of related items
- Appropriate confidence scoring reflecting metadata quality

### Critical User Scenarios
- Finding all items related to a historical figure despite spelling variations
- Identifying artifacts from a specific historical period despite date uncertainty
- Tracing the ownership history of a valuable item to establish authenticity
- Discovering connections between items in different physical collections
- Assessing the reliability of metadata for scholarly research

### Performance Benchmarks
- Execute fuzzy name matching across 1 million records in under 5 seconds
- Process temporal queries with uncertainty in under 3 seconds
- Traverse provenance chains up to 50 steps deep in under 2 seconds
- Perform cross-collection joins between 10 collections of 100,000 items each in under 10 seconds
- Calculate confidence scores for 10,000 search results in under 1 second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling extremely sparse metadata with minimal identifying information
- Processing items with highly conflicting date attributions
- Managing broken provenance chains with missing links
- Dealing with ambiguous entity references that could match multiple historical figures
- Calculating confidence when evidence sources themselves have varying reliability
