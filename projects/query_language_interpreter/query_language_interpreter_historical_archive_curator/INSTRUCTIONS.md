# Historical Archive Query Interpreter

A specialized query language interpreter for historical archives with support for fuzzy matching, temporal uncertainty handling, provenance tracking, cross-collection joins, and confidence scoring.

## Overview

This project implements a query language interpreter designed specifically for historical archives. It allows curators to query across heterogeneous collections of historical documents, photographs, and artifacts with complex and often incomplete metadata. The interpreter includes fuzzy matching capabilities, temporal uncertainty handling, provenance tracking, cross-collection joins, and confidence scoringâ€”essential features for working with historical materials that often have inconsistent or incomplete information.

## Persona Description

Eleanor digitizes and organizes historical documents, photographs, and artifacts with complex metadata. She needs to query across heterogeneous collections with varying attributes and incomplete information.

## Key Requirements

1. **Fuzzy Matching Operators**
   - Implement string similarity algorithms optimized for historical text (Levenshtein, Soundex, n-gram)
   - Support tolerance for historical spelling variations and transcription errors
   - Enable multilingual fuzzy matching for historical documents in different languages
   - Include context-aware similarity metrics that consider historical period and document type
   - Critical for Eleanor to find relevant items despite inconsistent spellings, transcription variations, and historical language differences in archival materials

2. **Temporal Uncertainty Handling**
   - Support queries with estimated dates, date ranges, and temporal qualifiers ("circa", "before", "after")
   - Implement overlap and containment operators for temporal ranges
   - Enable searching by historical periods and eras rather than just specific dates
   - Include specialized handling for different calendar systems and date formats
   - Essential for working with historical items that often have imprecise or estimated dating, allowing meaningful temporal queries despite uncertainty

3. **Provenance Chain Querying**
   - Track and query the acquisition history of items (previous owners, locations, transfers)
   - Support authentication evidence linking and verification
   - Enable provenance-based filtering and sorting in queries
   - Include visualization capabilities for provenance chains
   - Crucial for establishing item authenticity, tracking ownership history, and understanding the context and journey of historical artifacts

4. **Cross-Collection Joins**
   - Implement specialized join operations connecting items related by historical figures or events
   - Support relationship discovery across different collection types (documents, photos, artifacts)
   - Enable entity resolution across collections with different metadata schemas
   - Include transitive relationship discovery
   - Important for connecting related items across separate collections, revealing historical connections, and providing complete context for research

5. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Calculate and report reliability scores for query matches based on metadata quality
   - Support confidence thresholds in query filters
   - Enable result ranking based on metadata completeness and verification status
   - Include explanation capabilities for confidence calculations
   - Critical for evaluating the reliability of query results when working with historical data of varying quality and completeness

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Fuzzy matching algorithms must be testable with known historical spelling variations
- Temporal uncertainty handling must correctly process various date formats and ranges
- Provenance tracking must maintain complete chains in test datasets
- Cross-collection joins must identify known relationships in test data
- Confidence scoring must accurately reflect metadata quality in test cases

### Performance Expectations
- Process fuzzy search queries across 1 million catalog entries in under 60 seconds
- Handle temporal range queries with 100,000+ items in under 30 seconds
- Traverse provenance chains with up to 100 transfers in under 5 seconds
- Complete cross-collection joins across 10 different collections in under 2 minutes
- Calculate confidence scores with negligible performance impact

### Integration Points
- Import data from archival cataloging systems and databases
- Support standard metadata formats (Dublin Core, MODS, EAD)
- Export capabilities to research publication formats
- Integration with digital asset management systems
- Hooks for custom fuzzy matching algorithms

### Key Constraints
- Must work with incomplete and inconsistent historical metadata
- Should operate without requiring extensive metadata cleanup
- Must preserve all provenance information without simplification
- No strict schema requirements across different collections
- Must support operation on standard desktop hardware

## Core Functionality

The core of this Query Language Interpreter includes:

1. **Historical Text Processor**
   - Handle historical language variations
   - Implement fuzzy matching algorithms
   - Support multilingual text comparison
   - Process historical abbreviations and conventions

2. **Temporal Logic Engine**
   - Parse diverse historical date formats
   - Handle uncertainty in temporal data
   - Implement range-based date comparisons
   - Support different calendar systems

3. **Provenance Tracker**
   - Maintain ownership and location history
   - Record authentication evidence
   - Support chain validation and verification
   - Enable historical context reconstruction

4. **Entity Resolution System**
   - Match entities across different collections
   - Resolve historical figures and locations
   - Connect related items through shared attributes
   - Discover implicit relationships

5. **Confidence Calculator**
   - Evaluate metadata quality and completeness
   - Assess source reliability
   - Calculate match probability scores
   - Provide explanation for confidence levels

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate fuzzy matching of historical name variations
- Correct handling of uncertain and range-based dates
- Complete tracking of provenance chains
- Successful joining of related items across collections
- Appropriate confidence scoring based on metadata quality

### Critical User Scenarios
- Finding all documents related to a historical figure despite spelling variations
- Identifying artifacts from a specific historical period with uncertain dating
- Tracing the provenance of an item through multiple ownership transfers
- Connecting photographs, letters, and artifacts related to a specific historical event
- Assessing the reliability of metadata for a newly digitized collection

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete fuzzy name matching across 100,000 entries in under 30 seconds
- Process temporal range queries with 50,000 items in under 15 seconds
- Retrieve complete provenance chains in under 3 seconds
- Perform cross-collection entity resolution at a rate of 1,000 items per minute
- Calculate confidence scores for query results with less than 5% processing overhead

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling completely unstructured or minimal metadata
- Managing conflicting provenance information
- Dealing with extreme uncertainty in dating
- Processing items with multiple possible identities
- Handling collections with incompatible metadata schemas

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for fuzzy matching algorithms
- 100% coverage for temporal uncertainty handling
- Comprehensive tests for provenance chain scenarios
- Verification of cross-collection join accuracy
- Validation of confidence scoring against expert assessment

## Success Criteria

1. Fuzzy matching successfully finds relevant items despite historical spelling variations
2. Temporal uncertainty handling correctly processes and compares imprecise historical dates
3. Provenance chains are accurately maintained and queryable
4. Cross-collection joins successfully identify relationships between items
5. Confidence scoring reliably reflects the quality and reliability of metadata
6. Archivists can find relevant items significantly faster than with traditional catalog systems
7. Researchers can discover previously unknown connections between historical items
8. The system accommodates the incomplete and inconsistent nature of historical metadata
