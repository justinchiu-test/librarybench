# IoT Time Series Query Engine

A query language interpreter optimized for processing sensor data from distributed IoT devices.

## Overview

The IoT Time Series Query Engine provides a specialized query system for analyzing time-series measurements from thousands of distributed IoT devices. This project variant focuses on enabling efficient querying of sensor data at both edge and central locations, featuring time window operations, downsampling capabilities, anomaly detection, and device hierarchy traversal.

## Persona Description

Jamal builds IoT applications that process sensor data from thousands of distributed devices. He needs to query time-series measurements and device status information at the edge and in central systems.

## Key Requirements

1. **Time window operations optimized for continuous sensor data streams**
   - Implement efficient windowing operations (tumbling, sliding, session windows)
   - Support both time-based and count-based windows with customizable parameters
   - Enable window-specific aggregations (min, max, avg, sum, stddev, percentiles)
   - Include specialized time-series functions (rate of change, integrals, trends)
   - Critical for Jamal to analyze sensor data streams with time-varying characteristics and extract meaningful patterns from continuous measurements

2. **Downsampling functions balancing query performance against result precision**
   - Develop adaptive downsampling algorithms based on query context and time range
   - Support multiple downsampling strategies (averaging, min/max preservation, etc.)
   - Enable precision control with error bounds guarantees
   - Provide visual fidelity optimization for time-series visualization
   - Essential for balancing query performance against data fidelity when working with high-frequency sensor data across extended time periods

3. **Anomaly filters separating unusual readings from normal sensor variations**
   - Implement statistical and machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Support various detection algorithms (Z-score, MAD, IQR, DBSCAN, isolation forests)
   - Enable contextual anomaly detection considering both value and temporal patterns
   - Allow customizable sensitivity thresholds based on device type and application
   - Vital for automatically identifying sensor malfunctions, environmental changes, or unusual events across thousands of devices

4. **Device hierarchy traversal enabling queries across groups of related sensors**
   - Create a flexible device hierarchy model with customizable organization
   - Support queries that dynamically resolve device groups (buildings→floors→rooms→devices)
   - Enable inheritance of properties and configurations through the hierarchy
   - Provide aggregate calculations across device groups at any hierarchy level
   - Important for organizing and analyzing data from large numbers of sensors in logical, physical, or functional groups

5. **Intermittent connectivity handling with partial result management and completion**
   - Develop techniques for handling data gaps and delayed arrivals
   - Implement query continuation when connectivity is restored
   - Support incremental result updates without full recomputation
   - Enable adaptive query strategies based on connectivity conditions
   - Critical for maintaining reliable query operations across edge and cloud despite unreliable connections common in IoT environments
