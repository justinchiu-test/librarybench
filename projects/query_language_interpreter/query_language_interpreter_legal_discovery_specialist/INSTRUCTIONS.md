# Legal Discovery Query Interpreter

A specialized query language interpreter for legal document analysis with support for legal terminology mapping, proximity search, communication pattern analysis, temporal filtering, and privilege detection.

## Overview

This project implements a query language interpreter designed specifically for legal discovery processes. It allows legal specialists to search through large corporate document collections for litigation-relevant materials. The interpreter includes legal term ontology integration, proximity search capabilities, communication pattern analysis, temporal filtering with legal awareness, and privilege detectionâ€”essential features for conducting efficient and thorough legal discovery across emails, contracts, and internal documents.

## Persona Description

Carlos searches through large corporate document collections for litigation-relevant materials. He needs powerful query capabilities that can identify complex patterns across emails, contracts, and internal documents.

## Key Requirements

1. **Legal Term Ontology Integration**
   - Implement mapping between common concepts and specialized legal terminology
   - Support synonym expansion based on legal domain knowledge
   - Enable concept-based searching that finds documents regardless of specific wording
   - Include jurisdiction-specific term variations
   - Critical for Carlos to find relevant documents that may use different terminology to describe the same legal concepts, improving discovery completeness

2. **Proximity Search**
   - Support finding terms appearing near each other within documents
   - Enable configurable distance constraints (words, sentences, paragraphs)
   - Support ordered and unordered proximity matching
   - Include relevance scoring based on proximity patterns
   - Essential for identifying documents where specific concepts are discussed in relation to each other, helping focus on the most relevant content for a case

3. **Communication Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify and analyze exchanges between specific parties or departments
   - Support visualization of communication networks and frequency patterns
   - Enable detection of unusual communication patterns or deviations
   - Include sentiment and tone analysis in communication
   - Crucial for understanding relationships between parties, identifying key players in a matter, and detecting changes in communication that might indicate awareness of issues

4. **Temporal Filtering with Legal Awareness**
   - Implement date-based filtering with awareness of legal timeframes
   - Support statutory deadline calculations and relevance periods
   - Enable identification of documents within critical time windows
   - Include handling of different date formats and timezone considerations
   - Important for focusing discovery on legally relevant time periods, such as before filing dates, after notification of issues, or within statutory periods

5. **Privilege Detection**
   - Automatically flag potentially attorney-client privileged communications
   - Support identification of work product protected materials
   - Enable configurable privilege rules based on specific legal requirements
   - Include confidence scoring for privilege determinations
   - Critical for ensuring privileged materials are properly identified during the review process, preventing inadvertent production of protected documents

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Legal ontology mapping must correctly relate terms in test document sets
- Proximity search must find specified patterns in test corpora
- Communication pattern analysis must identify known networks in test datasets
- Temporal filtering must correctly apply legal timeframes to test scenarios
- Privilege detection must identify known privileged communications in test sets

### Performance Expectations
- Process ontology-based searches across 1 million documents in under 5 minutes
- Complete proximity searches in large document collections (10GB+) in under 10 minutes
- Analyze communication patterns across 1 million emails in under 15 minutes
- Apply temporal filters at a rate of at least 100,000 documents per minute
- Screen for privilege at a rate of at least 50,000 documents per minute

### Integration Points
- Import documents from various sources (email servers, document management systems)
- Support standard document formats (PDF, Office, emails, text)
- Export capabilities to review platforms and case management systems
- Integration with legal matter management software
- Support for production workflows with appropriate metadata

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain document integrity and chain of custody
- All operations must be auditable for defensibility
- Query processing should not alter original documents
- Must support operation within secure legal environments
- Results must be reproducible for verification and production challenges

## Core Functionality

The core of this Query Language Interpreter includes:

1. **Legal Document Processor**
   - Handle various document formats (emails, contracts, memos)
   - Extract text while preserving metadata
   - Manage document relationships and threading
   - Support redaction and privilege marking

2. **Legal Ontology Engine**
   - Maintain legal term relationships and mappings
   - Support concept-based expansion
   - Handle jurisdiction-specific terminology
   - Enable semantic search capabilities

3. **Communication Analyzer**
   - Identify communication patterns between parties
   - Map organizational relationships through communications
   - Detect anomalies in communication patterns
   - Analyze message content and context

4. **Legal Timeline Manager**
   - Handle date parsing and normalization
   - Implement legal timeframe calculations
   - Support date range filtering
   - Manage statutory and case-specific deadlines

5. **Privilege Classification System**
   - Identify potential attorney-client communications
   - Detect work product materials
   - Apply privilege rules based on jurisdictions
   - Support privilege review workflows

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate mapping of legal concepts to varied terminology
- Correct identification of terms within specified proximity
- Proper analysis of communication patterns between parties
- Accurate application of legal timeframes in temporal filtering
- Reliable detection of potentially privileged materials

### Critical User Scenarios
- Searching for documents discussing specific legal issues regardless of terminology
- Finding communications where certain topics are mentioned in relation to specific events
- Analyzing email exchanges between key employees during a critical time period
- Identifying documents created within specific statutory timeframes
- Screening document collections for privileged communications prior to production

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process ontology-enhanced searches across 500,000 documents in under 3 minutes
- Complete proximity searches in a 5GB document collection in under 5 minutes
- Analyze communication patterns in 100,000 emails in under 5 minutes
- Apply complex temporal filters to 1 million documents in under 10 minutes
- Screen 100,000 documents for privilege indicators in under 5 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling ambiguous legal terminology across different contexts
- Managing documents with unreliable or missing date information
- Processing communications with complex forwarding or BCC patterns
- Dealing with documents using non-standard formatting or encoding
- Identifying privilege in communications with both legal and business purposes

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- 95% code coverage for ontology mapping functions
- 100% coverage for privilege detection algorithms
- Comprehensive tests for proximity search variations
- Validation of temporal filtering with complex legal deadlines
- Performance testing with realistic document volumes and formats

## Success Criteria

1. Legal ontology mapping successfully identifies relevant documents regardless of specific terminology
2. Proximity search correctly finds terms appearing near each other according to specified constraints
3. Communication pattern analysis effectively identifies relevant exchanges between parties
4. Temporal filtering accurately applies legal timeframes to document collections
5. Privilege detection reliably flags potentially protected materials
6. Legal discovery professionals can find relevant documents significantly faster than with traditional tools
7. The system reduces the risk of missing critical documents during discovery
8. Review processes become more efficient and defensible
