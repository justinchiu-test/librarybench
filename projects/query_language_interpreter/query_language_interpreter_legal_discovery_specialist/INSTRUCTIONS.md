# Legal Discovery Query Engine

A query language interpreter specialized for searching through legal document collections for litigation-relevant materials.

## Overview

The Legal Discovery Query Engine provides a specialized query system for analyzing large corporate document collections during litigation discovery. This project variant focuses on enabling legal specialists to identify complex patterns across emails, contracts, and internal documents, featuring legal terminology awareness, proximity search, communication pattern analysis, and privilege detection.

## Persona Description

Carlos searches through large corporate document collections for litigation-relevant materials. He needs powerful query capabilities that can identify complex patterns across emails, contracts, and internal documents.

## Key Requirements

1. **Legal term ontology integration mapping common concepts to specialized terminology**
   - Implement integration with legal ontologies and taxonomies
   - Support concept-based searching beyond exact keyword matching
   - Enable synonym expansion for legal terminology
   - Provide jurisdictional variants for legal terms
   - Critical for Carlos to find relevant documents using conceptual searches rather than having to specify every possible variant of legal terminology

2. **Proximity search finding terms appearing near each other within documents**
   - Develop advanced proximity operators with customizable distance parameters
   - Support different proximity measures (words, sentences, paragraphs)
   - Enable ordered and unordered proximity constraints
   - Provide nested proximity expressions for complex patterns
   - Essential for identifying documents where related concepts appear in context with each other, distinguishing meaningful relationships from documents that mention terms separately

3. **Communication pattern analysis identifying exchanges between specific parties**
   - Create social network analysis for communication patterns
   - Support email thread reconstruction and conversation tracking
   - Enable identification of unusual communication patterns
   - Provide temporal analysis of communication frequency and timing
   - Vital for mapping relationships between parties and identifying communication patterns that could indicate relevant discussions

4. **Temporal filtering with awareness of legal timeframes and statutory deadlines**
   - Implement date-based filtering with special awareness of legal timeframes
   - Support relative date ranges based on key case events
   - Enable date approximation and inference from document context
   - Provide timeline visualization and clustering
   - Important for focusing discovery on relevant time periods and understanding document chronology in relation to legal events

5. **Privilege detection flagging potentially attorney-client protected materials**
   - Develop advanced classification for potentially privileged communications
   - Support recognition of attorney-client relationships in communications
   - Enable work product doctrine identification
   - Provide configurable sensitivity levels for privilege detection
   - Critical for identifying documents that may require special handling due to legal privilege, helping prevent inadvertent waiver of attorney-client privilege

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All text analysis functions must be testable with pytest
- Test legal term expansion against legal dictionaries
- Verify proximity search with reference documents
- Test communication pattern analysis against sample email datasets
- Validate privilege detection against legally annotated test sets

### Performance Expectations
- Process document collections of up to 10 million items
- Execute complex queries across 1TB of document data in under 2 minutes
- Support incremental indexing for continuously growing collections
- Enable interactive search refinement with sub-5-second response times
- Handle documents in multiple formats (email, Office, PDF) with consistent performance

### Integration Points
- Connect with document management and e-discovery platforms
- Support standard legal export formats (EDRM XML, load files)
- Interface with legal review platforms for further analysis
- Integrate with redaction and production tools
- Provide compatibility with review tagging systems

### Key Constraints
- Maintain chain of custody and document integrity
- Preserve document metadata throughout processing
- Support multi-language documents with consistent analysis
- Handle common OCR and conversion errors in legal documents
- Enable defensible search methodology documentation

### Implementation Notes
IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Legal Discovery Query Engine must implement the following core functionality:

1. **Document Processing and Indexing**
   - Parse various document formats preserving metadata
   - Create optimized indexes for legal-specific search needs
   - Extract and normalize dates, names, and entities
   - Maintain document family relationships (attachments, threads)

2. **Legal Query Language Processor**
   - Implement legal-specific query syntax and semantics
   - Support concept expansion and ontology integration
   - Enable advanced proximity and pattern searching
   - Process complex Boolean logic with nested expressions

3. **Communication and Relationship Analysis**
   - Identify communication patterns between parties
   - Reconstruct email threads and conversations
   - Map organizational relationships from communications
   - Analyze timing and frequency of exchanges

4. **Temporal Analysis Framework**
   - Normalize and standardize document dates
   - Align documents with case timeline events
   - Support relative temporal queries
   - Enable chronological analysis of document sets

5. **Privilege Classification System**
   - Identify potentially privileged communications
   - Detect attorney-client relationships
   - Flag work product materials
   - Support privilege log generation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of legal term expansion and concept searching
- Correct function of proximity operators at various distances
- Proper identification of communication patterns and relationships
- Accurate temporal filtering based on case events
- Reliable detection of potentially privileged materials

### Critical User Scenarios
- Finding all communications about a specific legal issue during a relevant timeframe
- Identifying discussions between key executives about regulatory compliance
- Locating contract language variations across multiple agreement versions
- Mapping communication patterns before and after a significant event
- Detecting potentially privileged materials before production to opposing counsel

### Performance Benchmarks
- Index at least 100GB of documents per day on standard hardware
- Execute complex privilege queries across 1 million documents in under 5 minutes
- Process proximity searches on 10 million documents in under 2 minutes
- Support at least 20 concurrent users with interactive response times
- Generate communication pattern reports for 100,000 emails in under 10 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling documents with poor OCR quality or conversion artifacts
- Processing highly technical or industry-specific terminology
- Managing documents with ambiguous or missing dates
- Dealing with code names or aliases for projects or individuals
- Identifying privilege in non-standard communications

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- Test legal term expansion with at least 1,000 legal terms across multiple practice areas
- Verify proximity search with at least 100 different distance patterns
- Test communication analysis with organizational structures of varying complexity
- Validate privilege detection with at least 500 sample privileged/non-privileged documents
