# Log Analysis Query Engine

A query language interpreter specialized for cloud application log analysis across distributed systems.

## Overview

The Log Analysis Query Engine provides a specialized query system for analyzing distributed system logs in various formats. This project variant focuses on enabling cloud application troubleshooting without centralizing logs into a dedicated database, featuring advanced pattern matching, event sequence detection, and distributed query execution capabilities.

## Persona Description

Sophia troubleshoots cloud application issues by analyzing distributed system logs in various formats. She needs to perform complex queries across log files without transferring them to a centralized database.

## Key Requirements

1. **Regular expression pattern matching optimized for log file formats**
   - Implement advanced regex support tailored for common log format patterns
   - Optimize pattern matching for high-speed scanning of large log volumes
   - Support named capture groups to extract structured data from unstructured logs
   - Add specialized log-oriented operators (e.g., for timestamp ranges, service patterns)
   - Critical for Sophia to quickly find relevant log entries across terabytes of data without manual scanning

2. **Event sequence detection identifying specific patterns of events across time**
   - Develop temporal pattern matching to find sequences of related events
   - Support time-window constraints (events occurring within N seconds of each other)
   - Allow conditional logic in pattern definitions (if X then Y unless Z)
   - Enable counting and statistical analysis of matching sequences
   - Essential for tracing the progression of errors through distributed systems to find root causes

3. **Log level filtering with context preservation showing surrounding entries**
   - Implement filtering by log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) with context awareness
   - Preserve a configurable number of entries before and after matches
   - Maintain relationship between parent-child process logs
   - Support intelligent context expansion based on thread IDs or correlation IDs
   - Important for understanding the environment and state leading up to and following errors

4. **Session reconstruction grouping related operations by request ID or user session**
   - Create session tracking across distributed services using correlation IDs
   - Reconstruct complete user sessions spanning multiple services and log files
   - Support temporal sorting and visualization of session events
   - Enable performance analysis of session operations
   - Critical for understanding the full context of user-reported issues or performance problems

5. **Distributed query execution processing logs directly on multiple remote servers**
   - Implement remote execution of queries on log sources to avoid data transfer
   - Support aggregation of results from multiple sources
   - Enable parallel processing across distributed logs
   - Provide bandwidth-efficient result streaming
   - Essential for working with large-scale distributed systems where logs cannot be practically centralized

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be unit-testable with pytest
- Test distributed execution with containerized mock log sources
- Verify regex performance against large log datasets (>1GB)
- Test event sequence detection with complex temporal patterns
- Evaluate session reconstruction accuracy with known session data

### Performance Expectations
- Process logs at rates exceeding 100MB/second on standard hardware
- Execute complex regex patterns with minimal performance degradation
- Support distributed queries across at least 20 concurrent log sources
- Reconstruct sessions containing up to 10,000 events in under 5 seconds
- Return first results within 2 seconds for interactive troubleshooting

### Integration Points
- Connect to common log formats (plain text, JSON, XML, syslog, custom formats)
- Support standard log transport protocols (file, syslog, HTTP, Kafka)
- Integrate with SSH/SCP for secure remote log access
- Provide output formats compatible with analysis tools
- Offer extension points for custom log format parsers

### Key Constraints
- Operate without requiring log centralization or indexing
- Minimize network bandwidth usage during distributed operations
- Support analysis without modifying existing logging configurations
- Run efficiently on limited-resource environments (e.g., edge nodes)
- Respect security boundaries when accessing logs across different systems

### Implementation Notes
IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Log Analysis Query Engine must implement the following core functionality:

1. **Log Parsing and Indexing**
   - Detect and parse various log formats automatically
   - Create efficient in-memory indexes for high-speed searching
   - Implement adaptive parsing for custom log formats
   - Extract structured data from unstructured log entries

2. **Query Language Processor**
   - Develop a log-oriented query language with regex support
   - Implement operators for temporal relationships between events
   - Support aggregation and statistical operations on log data
   - Enable semantic queries based on log content meaning, not just text

3. **Pattern Matching Engine**
   - Optimize regex execution for log-specific patterns
   - Implement event sequence detection across time windows
   - Support complex conditional pattern matching
   - Enable fuzzy matching for error messages with variable components

4. **Distributed Execution System**
   - Manage remote query execution on multiple servers
   - Implement efficient result aggregation and streaming
   - Support secure authentication for remote log access
   - Enable parallel processing for improved performance

5. **Analysis and Correlation**
   - Reconstruct user sessions and request flows
   - Identify related events across different services
   - Calculate performance metrics from log events
   - Detect anomalies and patterns in system behavior

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct parsing of all supported log formats

### Critical User Scenarios
- Tracing a user request through a microservices architecture to identify bottlenecks
- Finding all occurrences of a specific error pattern across multiple services
- Detecting sequences of events leading to system failures

- Comparing log patterns before and after a system change

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process at least 100MB of log data per second per core
- Execute common regex patterns in under 10ms per GB of log data
- Complete distributed queries across 5 servers in under 30 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed log entries with parsing errors
- Managing logs with inconsistent timestamps or time zones
- Processing logs with missing correlation IDs or broken session chains
