# Legal Discovery Query Language Interpreter

## Overview
This specialized Query Language Interpreter enables legal discovery specialists to efficiently search through large corporate document collections for litigation-relevant materials. The interpreter integrates with legal term ontologies, provides proximity search capabilities, analyzes communication patterns, offers temporal filtering with legal timeframe awareness, and includes privilege detection, making it an ideal tool for e-discovery in litigation cases.

## Persona Description
Carlos searches through large corporate document collections for litigation-relevant materials. He needs powerful query capabilities that can identify complex patterns across emails, contracts, and internal documents.

## Key Requirements
1. **Legal term ontology integration mapping common concepts to specialized terminology**: Connects queries to comprehensive legal term ontologies that automatically expand searches to include specialized legal terminology, industry jargon, known abbreviations, and conceptually related terms, enabling discovery specialists to find relevant documents even when they use technical language different from the initial search terms.

2. **Proximity search finding terms appearing near each other within documents**: Enables searching for terms that appear within a specified distance of each other (sentences, paragraphs, pages), critical for identifying documents where key concepts are discussed in relation to each other rather than just appearing separately within the same document.

3. **Communication pattern analysis identifying exchanges between specific parties**: Provides capabilities to analyze email and message communications to identify exchanges between specific individuals or departments, including message chains, reply patterns, and distribution lists, essential for reconstructing conversations relevant to litigation.

4. **Temporal filtering with awareness of legal timeframes and statutory deadlines**: Incorporates specialized date filtering functions aware of legal timeframes (statutes of limitations, regulatory deadlines, corporate events), enabling precise targeting of documents created during legally significant periods without requiring manual date calculations.

5. **Privilege detection flagging potentially attorney-client protected materials**: Automatically identifies documents that may contain privileged attorney-client communications or work product based on sender/recipient patterns, legal terminology, and formatting cues, helping to prevent inadvertent disclosure of protected materials during the discovery process.

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- Legal term expansion must be tested with diverse legal practice areas
- Proximity search must be verified for accuracy at different distance thresholds
- Communication pattern analysis must be validated with complex email datasets
- Temporal filtering must be tested with various legal timeframe scenarios
- Privilege detection must be evaluated against known privileged document samples

### Performance Expectations
- Must efficiently process document collections exceeding 10 million pages
- Search response times should remain under 5 seconds for typical legal queries
- Communication pattern analysis should scale with the size of message repositories
- Memory usage should be optimized for operation on standard legal workstations
- Index structures should be optimized for the specific challenges of legal documents

### Integration Points
- Support for common legal document formats (PDF, DOCX, emails, etc.)
- Compatibility with e-discovery platforms and document management systems
- Export capabilities compliant with legal production requirements
- Optional integration with case management systems
- Support for legal document metadata standards

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain document integrity and chain of custody
- Implementation must be defensible in court proceedings
- All operations must be thoroughly logged for transparency
- System must handle the variety of document types in corporate collections
- Must operate within the technical constraints of legal environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Relevance scoring specifically tuned for legal discovery

2. **Document Analysis Framework**:
   - Full-text indexing optimized for legal terminology
   - Proximity detection with configurable distance metrics
   - Metadata extraction and classification
   - Content-based similarity assessment

3. **Communication Analysis System**:
   - Email thread reconstruction algorithms
   - Participant relationship mapping
   - Distribution pattern identification
   - Conversation flow analysis

4. **Temporal Management**:
   - Legal timeframe definition and calculation
   - Date normalization across document types
   - Period-based filtering operations
   - Timeline generation and analysis

5. **Privilege Protection**:
   - Attorney identification and relationship tracking
   - Privilege indicators detection
   - Confidence scoring for privilege assessment
   - Privilege log generation assistance

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of legal term expansion with various practice areas
- Precision and recall of proximity searches at different thresholds
- Correct identification of communication patterns and relationships
- Proper filtering based on legally significant time periods
- Effectiveness of privilege detection compared to manual review

### Critical User Scenarios
- Finding documents relevant to specific legal issues across large collections
- Identifying communications between key individuals during critical periods
- Analyzing contract language for specific clauses or provisions
- Filtering documents based on relevant statutory periods
- Screening documents for potential privilege before production

### Performance Benchmarks
- Full-text search should process at least 1 million documents in under 10 seconds
- Term expansion should support ontologies with at least 50,000 legal concepts
- Communication pattern analysis should handle email repositories exceeding 5 million messages
- System should maintain interactive performance with document collections up to 20TB
- Privilege detection should process at least 10,000 documents per hour

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of corrupt or password-protected documents
- Proper management of unusual document formats or encodings
- Appropriate treatment of ambiguous dates or inconsistent timestamps
- Graceful handling of extremely large documents or email threads
- Behavior with documents containing mixed languages or legal systems

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage for privilege detection and term expansion functions
- All temporal filtering operations must have dedicated test cases
- Communication pattern analysis must be tested with various email formats
- Proximity search must be verified with different document types and structures

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation will:

1. Effectively expand searches using legal term ontologies, demonstrated through tests with various legal practice areas
2. Accurately perform proximity searches at different distance thresholds, verified with test documents having known term relationships
3. Correctly identify communication patterns between specific parties, validated with test email datasets
4. Properly filter documents based on legal timeframes, confirmed through tests with various statutory period scenarios
5. Successfully detect potentially privileged documents, demonstrated through comparison with expert-reviewed privilege determinations

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona
