# Government Agency Information Site Generator

A specialized static site generator optimized for creating and maintaining compliant, accessible government agency websites.

## Overview

This project provides a compliance-focused static site generator that enables government agencies to create, maintain, and publish regulatory information, public notices, and community resources in an accessible format that meets legal requirements. The system automates compliance checks, document organization, and multi-language support.

## Persona Description

Miguel works for a municipal government agency and needs to publish regulatory information, public notices, and community resources in an accessible format that meets compliance requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Accessibility Compliance Checking**: Ensure WCAG standards are met throughout the site.
   - As a government agency, Miguel's organization has legal requirements to make all digital information accessible to citizens with disabilities according to WCAG standards.
   - The system must validate content against accessibility guidelines, providing reports and recommendations for improvements, and ensuring generated pages meet compliance requirements.

2. **Document Repository**: Create searchable, categorized public records and forms.
   - Government agencies maintain extensive collections of public documents that citizens need to access, so Miguel needs to organize these in a structured, searchable repository.
   - This feature must support document categorization, metadata, versioning, and powerful search capabilities to help citizens find relevant information.

3. **Legal Notice Templates**: Generate properly formatted official announcements.
   - Publishing official notices with proper formatting and metadata is a core function of government communication, requiring standardized templates for consistency and compliance.
   - The system should provide templates that meet legal requirements for public notices with appropriate metadata, timestamps, and archiving.

4. **Multi-language Content Management**: Support translation workflow for diverse communities.
   - Miguel's agency serves a diverse community with multiple language needs, requiring content to be available in several languages while maintaining consistency across translations.
   - The feature must support parallel content in multiple languages with synchronization to ensure translations remain current as the primary content changes.

5. **PDF Generation**: Create printer-friendly versions of online content for official documents.
   - Many government processes still require physical documents, so Miguel needs to automatically generate properly formatted PDF versions of online content.
   - This capability must create accessible PDFs that maintain formatting, include necessary metadata, and satisfy archive requirements.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Accessibility validation must verify compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Document repository functionality must test metadata extraction and search capabilities
- Legal notice templates must validate against formatting and content requirements
- Multi-language management must verify content synchronization across languages
- PDF generation must validate formatting and accessibility of generated documents

### Performance Expectations
- Complete site generation should finish in under 30 seconds for a typical agency site
- Accessibility checks should validate pages at a rate of at least 10 per second
- Document repository should index and search 10,000+ documents in under 5 seconds
- Language variant generation should process 5000+ content items across 5 languages in under 60 seconds
- PDF generation should convert 100 pages to accessible PDFs in under 30 seconds

### Integration Points
- Accessibility validation libraries and tools
- Document indexing and search engines
- PDF generation libraries supporting accessibility
- Translation management systems
- WCAG compliance checkers and validators

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without a database or server-side processing for the generated site
- Must generate completely static output deployable to government-approved hosting
- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards at minimum
- Must support Section 508 compliance for US government agencies
- Must generate proper metadata for all content and documents
- Must support incremental builds to minimize processing time

## Core Functionality

The system should implement a comprehensive platform for government website generation:

1. **Accessibility Compliance System**
   - Validate content against WCAG guidelines
   - Generate compliance reports with specific issues
   - Implement automatic fixes for common accessibility problems
   - Ensure accessible navigation and structure

2. **Document Management System**
   - Process structured document metadata
   - Generate document landing pages with metadata
   - Create categorized document repositories
   - Implement search functionality across document collections

3. **Legal Content Framework**
   - Implement templates for different notice types
   - Validate notices against formatting requirements
   - Generate appropriate timestamps and identifiers
   - Create archives of historical notices

4. **Language Management System**
   - Process content in multiple languages
   - Generate parallel site structures for each language
   - Synchronize updates across language variants
   - Create language selection interfaces

5. **Print Format Generator**
   - Convert HTML content to accessible PDF
   - Implement consistent formatting for printed materials
   - Generate appropriate metadata for PDF documents
   - Create printer-friendly versions of complex content

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accessibility validation with comprehensive WCAG coverage
- Document repository with accurate metadata and search
- Legal notice generation with proper formatting
- Multi-language content management with synchronization
- PDF generation with accessibility features

### Critical User Scenarios
- Publishing a new legal notice with proper formatting
- Adding documents to the repository with complete metadata
- Creating content in multiple languages with proper relationships
- Validating site content for accessibility compliance
- Generating accessible PDFs from web content

### Performance Benchmarks
- Validate 100 pages for accessibility in under 10 seconds
- Index and enable search across 10,000 documents in under 5 seconds
- Generate 5 language variants of a 1000-page site in under 60 seconds
- Create 100 PDF documents with accessibility features in under 30 seconds
- Complete full site generation for a typical agency in under 30 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling documents with complex formatting requirements
- Managing content with missing translations
- Processing accessibility issues that cannot be automatically fixed
- Dealing with very large documents in the repository
- Handling edge cases in PDF conversion

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% line coverage for core processing components
- 100% coverage for accessibility validation functionality
- Integration tests for all document processing functions
- Validation tests for generated PDFs
- Performance tests for search and indexing operations

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if it:

1. Validates content against WCAG 2.1 AA standards with specific issue identification
2. Creates a searchable document repository supporting at least 10,000 documents with appropriate metadata
3. Generates properly formatted legal notices that meet government standards
4. Supports content in at least 5 different languages with proper synchronization
5. Produces accessible PDFs that pass automated accessibility validation
6. Processes a typical government agency site (1000 pages, 5000 documents) in under 30 seconds
7. Achieves all required test coverage metrics with a clean test suite

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` in your project directory
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`
3. Run Python scripts with `uv run python your_script.py`
4. Run tests with `uv run pytest`

When implementing this library, focus on creating well-defined APIs that provide all the required functionality without any user interface components. All features should be implementable as pure Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest.
