# Government Agency Information Portal Generator

A specialized static site generator for creating accessible, compliant government websites that effectively organize public information, regulatory content, and community resources.

## Overview

This project is a Python library for generating comprehensive government agency websites from structured content sources. It focuses on accessibility compliance, document management, multi-language support, and official notice formatting to meet the unique requirements of government information portals.

## Persona Description

Miguel works for a municipal government agency and needs to publish regulatory information, public notices, and community resources in an accessible format that meets compliance requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Accessibility Compliance System**: Implement comprehensive accessibility checking to ensure all generated content meets WCAG standards. As a government agency, Miguel's site must be legally compliant with accessibility regulations, making this feature essential to automatically detect and remedy potential barriers for users with disabilities across all generated pages.

2. **Document Repository Management**: Create a system for organizing, categorizing, and making searchable public records and government forms. Miguel's agency must maintain transparent access to numerous official documents and forms, requiring a structured repository that allows citizens to easily locate specific documents through multiple categorization schemes and search functionality.

3. **Legal Notice Template System**: Develop specialized templates with proper formatting for official announcements and legal notices. Government agencies have strict requirements for how official notices must be formatted and presented to have legal standing, making this feature critical for Miguel to ensure all public announcements meet required standards for official communication.

4. **Multi-language Content Management**: Implement a framework for managing and displaying content in multiple languages with translation workflow support. To serve diverse community members, Miguel needs to provide critical government information in multiple languages, with a systematic approach to managing translations and ensuring content parity across language versions.

5. **PDF Generation System**: Create functionality for automatically generating printer-friendly PDF versions of online content. For official documentation and records purposes, Miguel's agency requires PDF versions of web content that maintain proper formatting, pagination, headers/footers, and official markings for distribution and archival purposes.

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Accessibility compliance must be automatically verified against WCAG standards
  - Document repository structure must be validatable with test data
  - Legal notice formatting must be verified against regulatory requirements
  - Multi-language content must be tested for completeness across languages
  - PDF generation must produce consistent, valid documents

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Full site generation must complete in under 2 minutes for sites with up to 1000 pages
  - Document search functionality should return results in under 200ms
  - Language switching should occur without page reloads
  - PDF generation should complete in under 5 seconds per document
  - Accessibility checking should not increase build time by more than 20%

- **Integration Points**:
  - Accessibility evaluation tools and standards (WCAG)
  - Document management systems and metadata standards
  - PDF generation libraries with proper document structure
  - Translation management workflows
  - Government compliance checking tools

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All site content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum
  - Document repository must support standard government metadata
  - Legal notices must conform to jurisdictional formatting requirements
  - Translation management must support workflow approval processes
  - Generated PDFs must include proper metadata and be archivable

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality must include:

1. **Accessibility Enforcement System**:
   - Validate HTML against WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Check color contrast ratios for text visibility
   - Ensure proper heading structure and landmark regions
   - Verify image alt text and form labeling
   - Generate accessibility compliance reports

2. **Document Management Framework**:
   - Process document metadata in standardized formats
   - Create searchable document indexes with filtering
   - Organize documents by multiple categorization schemes
   - Generate document listings with proper sorting options
   - Support document versioning and update tracking

3. **Legal Content Management**:
   - Generate properly formatted legal notices
   - Apply required styling and structure for official communications
   - Include mandatory elements (dates, reference numbers, authority citations)
   - Create archives of historical notices
   - Support notice types with different requirements

4. **Multilingual Content System**:
   - Process content with language-specific variations
   - Generate parallel sites or pages for each supported language
   - Implement language switching while maintaining context
   - Track translation status and completeness
   - Handle language-specific formatting (dates, numbers, etc.)

5. **PDF Export System**:
   - Transform web content to properly formatted PDFs
   - Include required headers, footers, and page numbering
   - Apply document security and metadata
   - Generate document tables of contents
   - Support batch generation of multiple documents

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Compliance with accessibility standards across all content types
  - Proper organization and searchability of document repository
  - Correct formatting of legal notices according to requirements
  - Complete content presentation across multiple languages
  - Accurate PDF generation with proper document structure

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Citizen with screen reader accesses government information
  - Resident searches for specific regulatory documents
  - Staff publishes a legal notice with required formatting
  - Non-English speaker accesses translated content
  - User downloads official PDF version of online information

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Site generation time for different volumes of content
  - Document search response time with various repository sizes
  - Language switching time between content versions
  - PDF generation time for documents of different complexity
  - Accessibility compliance checking time impact

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of documents with complex structures or unusual formats
  - Management of content with incomplete translations
  - Recovery from invalid or improperly formatted source content
  - Processing of extremely long legal notices or documents
  - Accessibility challenges with specialized content (maps, charts, forms)

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 95% code coverage for accessibility checking functions
  - 90% coverage for document management system
  - 95% coverage for legal notice generation
  - 90% coverage for multi-language content management
  - 90% coverage for PDF generation system

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The generated site passes WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
2. Document repository effectively organizes and provides access to public records
3. Legal notices are generated with correct, jurisdiction-appropriate formatting
4. Content is consistently available across all supported languages
5. PDF versions of content maintain proper formatting and official requirements
6. All government compliance requirements are demonstrably met
7. All tests pass with at least 90% code coverage
8. Content updates can be made by non-technical staff through structured data files
