# Technical Documentation Site Generator

A specialized static site generator optimized for creating and maintaining comprehensive software documentation portals.

## Overview

This project provides a documentation-focused static site generator that enables technical writers to create, maintain, and publish multiple documentation sites with consistent branding but different content structures. The system automates the transformation of technical documentation into professionally organized, navigable, and visually appealing documentation portals.

## Persona Description

Sarah creates comprehensive documentation for open-source software projects and needs to maintain multiple documentation sites with consistent branding but different content structures. Her primary goal is to focus on writing clear technical explanations while automating the process of creating professional documentation portals.

## Key Requirements

1. **API Reference Generation**: Automatically extract code documentation and convert it to navigable API references.
   - Sarah maintains documentation for libraries with extensive APIs, so automatic extraction and formatting of code comments into browsable references allows her to focus on writing supplemental explanations rather than duplicating information already in the codebase.
   - This feature must support multiple programming languages and extract documentation from different code comment styles.

2. **Documentation Versioning**: Support maintaining different versions of content for multiple software releases.
   - As the projects Sarah documents frequently update, she needs to maintain documentation for multiple versions simultaneously, enabling users to find information relevant to the specific version they're using.
   - This must include version switching interfaces and clear indicators of version-specific content.

3. **Integrated Code Snippet Highlighting**: Support syntax highlighting specific to different programming languages with line numbering.
   - Technical documentation relies heavily on code examples, and proper syntax highlighting with line numbers makes examples more readable and referenceable for users.
   - Multiple language support is essential as the projects she documents often include examples in several languages.

4. **Interactive Code Examples**: Support embedding runnable code samples with user-modifiable parameters.
   - Interactive examples allow documentation readers to experiment with API features directly in the documentation, improving understanding and reducing the barrier to trying features.
   - These examples should be self-contained and work without external dependencies.

5. **Technical Diagram Generation**: Generate diagrams from text-based descriptions (like Mermaid or PlantUML).
   - Diagrams are essential for explaining complex concepts and workflows in documentation, but maintaining them as separate image files is cumbersome and they quickly become outdated.
   - Text-based diagram definitions allow diagrams to live alongside documentation content and stay updated through the same revision process.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be modular with clear interfaces to enable isolated testing
- Documentation parsing and transformation must be testable with sample input files
- Diagram generation must verify correct rendering of valid diagram specifications
- API extraction must verify accurate extraction of documentation from code comments
- Version control features must verify proper handling of content across multiple versions

### Performance Expectations
- Content processing pipeline should handle at least 1000 documentation pages in under 30 seconds
- Live preview generation should update within 1 second of content changes for standard pages
- API reference generation should process large codebases (>50,000 lines) in under 60 seconds
- Diagram rendering should complete in under 2 seconds per diagram

### Integration Points
- Code parsers for extracting API documentation from source code files
- Diagram rendering engines (Mermaid, PlantUML, or similar)
- Version control system (Git) integration for content versioning
- Markdown and other markup format processors
- Code syntax highlighting libraries

### Key Constraints
- Must operate as a library/API without UI components
- Must generate static output that can be hosted on any web server without server-side processing
- Must support incremental builds to minimize processing time during content updates
- Must be extensible to support additional markup formats and documentation extraction methods

## Core Functionality

The system should implement a pipeline-based architecture for processing and transforming technical documentation into static websites:

1. **Content Processing Engine**
   - Parse markup files (Markdown, reStructuredText, etc.)
   - Extract frontmatter/metadata from content files
   - Apply transformations for specialized markup extensions

2. **API Documentation Extraction**
   - Parse source code files to extract documentation comments
   - Organize extracted documentation into navigable reference structures
   - Link related API components (classes, methods, parameters, etc.)

3. **Version Management System**
   - Maintain separate content trees for different documentation versions
   - Generate version-specific outputs while sharing common assets
   - Support version comparison and migration guides

4. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - Transform processed content into HTML
   - Apply templates for consistent layout and navigation
   - Generate specialized components (API references, diagrams, interactive examples)

5. **Asset Management**
   - Process and optimize images, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Generate diagrams from text-based descriptions
   - Organize and link assets in the output directory structure

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- API documentation extraction accuracy from various code formats
- Documentation versioning with proper content segregation
- Code highlighting for multiple programming languages
- Interactive code example functionality
- Technical diagram generation from text-based descriptions

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a new documentation project with multiple sections
- Adding a new version to existing documentation
- Extracting API documentation from a codebase
- Including interactive code examples that properly execute
- Generating technical diagrams from text descriptions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete site generation under 60 seconds for a project with 1000+ pages
- API extraction from a 50,000 line codebase in under 60 seconds
- Live preview updates within 1 second of content changes
- Diagram generation performance of at least 30 diagrams per minute

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed documentation source files
- Graceful degradation for unsupported diagram types
- Error reporting for invalid code in interactive examples
- Handling of inconsistent versioning in documentation files
- Recovery from interrupted build processes

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core processing components
- 100% coverage for API extraction functionality
- Comprehensive integration tests for the full processing pipeline
- Performance tests for all time-sensitive operations

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if it:

1. Reduces the time Sarah spends on API documentation by at least 50% through automated extraction
2. Enables simultaneous maintenance of at least 3 different documentation versions with clear distinction between them
3. Provides syntax highlighting for at least 10 different programming languages with accurate language detection
4. Enables creation of interactive code examples that demonstrate API usage without external dependencies
5. Generates accurate technical diagrams from text-based descriptions in at least 2 formats (Mermaid, PlantUML)
6. Processes a typical documentation set of 500 pages in under 30 seconds
7. Achieves all required test coverage metrics with a clean test suite

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project using `uv init --lib` in your project directory
2. Install dependencies using `uv sync`
3. Run Python scripts with `uv run python your_script.py`
4. Run tests with `uv run pytest`

When implementing this library, focus on creating well-defined APIs that provide all the required functionality without any user interface components. All features should be implementable as pure Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest.
