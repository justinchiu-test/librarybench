# Cloud-Native Startup Monitoring Platform

## Overview
A flexible, infrastructure-as-code compatible monitoring system designed for rapidly evolving cloud environments that correlates system metrics with cost implications, integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, maps microservice dependencies, tracks auto-scaling events, and visualizes performance impacts of deployments.

## Persona Description
Priya manages cloud infrastructure for a rapidly growing startup with evolving deployment needs. She needs lightweight monitoring that can scale with their system without requiring significant reconfiguration as architecture changes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Cost Correlation Engine**
   - Implement a system that links resource utilization metrics to estimated cloud provider costs
   - This is critical because growing startups need to optimize cloud expenses while scaling to prevent unexpected cost overruns
   - The correlation must provide actionable insights on which services, features, or usage patterns are driving costs

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Integration**
   - Create a monitoring deployment system that can be defined and provisioned alongside infrastructure resources
   - This is essential because modern DevOps workflows require all infrastructure components, including monitoring, to be defined as code
   - The integration must support common IaC tools and adapt to changing infrastructure definitions without manual reconfiguration

3. **Microservice Dependency Mapping**
   - Develop functionality to discover and visualize communication patterns between microservices
   - This is vital because understanding service dependencies helps troubleshoot issues, plan scaling, and prevent cascading failures
   - The mapping must automatically adapt to new services and changing architectures without manual configuration

4. **Auto-scaling Event Tracking**
   - Implement monitoring for auto-scaling activities that correlates scaling events with system performance metrics
   - This is important because understanding when and why auto-scaling occurs helps optimize scaling policies and resource allocation
   - The tracking must capture pre and post-scaling metrics to evaluate scaling effectiveness

5. **Deployment Impact Visualization**
   - Create a system to compare performance metrics before and after code deployments
   - This is crucial because DevOps teams need to quickly identify when deployments negatively impact system performance
   - The visualization must highlight significant performance changes that correlate with deployment events

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have unit tests with minimum 85% code coverage
  - Mock cloud provider APIs for testing cost correlation without actual cloud resources
  - Simulation framework for testing auto-scaling scenarios and deployment events
  - Test fixtures for different infrastructure configurations and service topologies
  - Parameterized tests for validating behavior across various cloud environments

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Monitoring data collection must have minimal impact on production services
  - Dependency mapping must complete discovery cycles within 10 minutes
  - Cost correlation calculations must refresh at least every 30 minutes
  - Auto-scale event detection must occur within 30 seconds of scaling activity
  - Deployment impact analysis must be available within 5 minutes of deployment completion

- **Integration Points**
  - Cloud provider APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure) for resource and cost data
  - Infrastructure-as-Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
  - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI)
  - Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, ECS)
  - Existing logging and metrics systems (Prometheus, CloudWatch, Stackdriver)

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must minimize additional cloud costs for monitoring infrastructure
  - Cannot require privileged access beyond standard cloud service role permissions
  - Must support multi-cloud and hybrid environments
  - Storage and processing must scale automatically with infrastructure growth
  - Must not introduce significant latency to monitored services

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. **Resource Cost Analysis**
   - Collection of resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, I/O, network)
   - Correlation with cloud provider pricing models
   - Cost attribution to specific services, functions, and components
   - Anomaly detection for unexpected cost increases
   - Optimization recommendations based on usage patterns

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Compatibility**
   - Monitoring definitions using infrastructure-as-code syntax
   - Auto-discovery of resources based on cloud provider tags/labels
   - Dynamic reconfiguration when infrastructure changes
   - Version-controlled monitoring configuration
   - Validation of monitoring coverage against defined infrastructure

3. **Service Relationship Analysis**
   - Network traffic analysis between services and components
   - Automatic detection of service dependencies and communication patterns
   - Identification of critical path services and potential bottlenecks
   - Service health impact mapping (how one service affects others)
   - API call volume and pattern visualization

4. **Scaling Event Intelligence**
   - Detection and logging of auto-scaling events across services
   - Pre and post-scaling performance metric collection
   - Correlation of scaling triggers with system load indicators
   - Scaling efficiency analysis (was scaling necessary and effective?)
   - Recommendation engine for scaling policy adjustments

5. **Deployment Performance Impact**
   - Baseline performance establishment before deployments
   - Continuous measurement during and after deployment events
   - Statistical comparison of pre and post-deployment metrics
   - Automatic detection of significant performance regressions
   - Correlation of code changes with performance impacts

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accuracy of cloud cost estimations compared to actual billing data
  - Correct synchronization of monitoring with infrastructure-as-code changes
  - Precision of service dependency discovery and mapping
  - Reliability of auto-scaling event detection and analysis
  - Effectiveness of deployment impact identification

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Analyzing cost increases after adding new service features
  - Deploying new infrastructure with automatically configured monitoring
  - Troubleshooting service communication issues in a complex microservice architecture
  - Evaluating the effectiveness of auto-scaling policies during traffic spikes
  - Identifying performance regressions introduced by a specific deployment

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Cost correlation metrics must be within 10% of actual cloud billing data
  - Infrastructure changes must be reflected in monitoring within 5 minutes
  - Service dependency mapping must identify 95% of dependencies
  - Auto-scaling events must be detected within 30 seconds
  - Deployment impact analysis must identify performance changes of 10% or greater

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - System behavior during cloud provider API outages or rate limiting
  - Recovery after monitoring service interruptions
  - Handling of rapid, continuous infrastructure changes
  - Management of incomplete or inconsistent cloud resource metadata
  - Behavior during major architecture transitions (monolith to microservices)

- **Test Coverage Requirements**
  - Minimum 85% code coverage across all components
  - 100% coverage for cost calculation and service mapping core logic
  - All cloud provider integrations must have dedicated test suites
  - Error handling and retry logic must be fully tested
  - Multi-cloud scenarios must be verified through specific test cases

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

1. Estimate cloud costs with at least 90% accuracy compared to actual cloud provider billing
