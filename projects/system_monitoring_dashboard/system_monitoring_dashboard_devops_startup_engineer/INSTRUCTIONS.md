# Cloud-Centric Monitoring Platform

A dynamic monitoring solution tailored for DevOps engineers at rapidly growing startups managing evolving cloud infrastructure.

## Overview

This implementation of PyMonitor focuses on cloud infrastructure monitoring with an emphasis on cost tracking, infrastructure-as-code integration, microservice dependency mapping, scaling event correlation, and deployment impact analysis to support the rapidly evolving needs of a growing startup.

## Persona Description

Priya manages cloud infrastructure for a rapidly growing startup with evolving deployment needs. She needs lightweight monitoring that can scale with their system without requiring significant reconfiguration as architecture changes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Provider Cost Correlation**
   - Track system metrics and correlate them with estimated cloud provider costs
   - Monitor resource utilization across different pricing tiers and instance types
   - Generate cost optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
   - Forecast future cloud costs based on growth trends
   - Identify underutilized resources that could be downsized or terminated
   - This is critical because startups have limited budgets and need to optimize cloud spending while maintaining performance as they rapidly scale.

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Integration**
   - Automatically deploy monitoring alongside new infrastructure created via IaC tools
   - Support integration with Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, etc.
   - Generate monitoring configurations from infrastructure definitions
   - Track infrastructure changes and correlate with monitoring metrics
   - Support tagging and metadata standardization across monitored resources
   - This is critical because DevOps engineers in startups frequently provision and modify infrastructure through code and need monitoring to adapt automatically.

3. **Microservice Dependency Mapping**
   - Discover and visualize service-to-service communication patterns
   - Track API dependencies and data flow between services
   - Identify critical path services and potential bottlenecks
   - Monitor cross-service latency and error propagation
   - Generate service health scores based on upstream and downstream dependencies
   - This is critical because understanding the relationships between microservices helps identify the root cause of issues in complex distributed systems.

4. **Auto-scaling Event Tracking**
   - Correlate system load metrics with auto-scaling decisions
   - Track scaling events and their impact on performance and costs
   - Identify scaling thresholds that may need adjustment
   - Provide recommendations for optimizing scaling policies
   - Alert on unusual scaling patterns that may indicate issues
   - This is critical because auto-scaling is essential for cost-efficient operations, but incorrectly configured scaling can lead to performance problems or excessive costs.

5. **Deployment Impact Visualization**
   - Track performance metrics before, during, and after deployments
   - Correlate code changes with system behavior changes
   - Identify deployments that negatively impact performance or stability
   - Support automated deployment health checks and rollback recommendations
   - Generate deployment impact reports for stakeholders
   - This is critical because frequent deployments in startup environments require immediate feedback on performance impacts to maintain quality while moving quickly.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with pytest without requiring actual cloud infrastructure
- Cloud cost correlation must be verifiable with simulated resource usage data
- IaC integration must be testable with mock infrastructure definitions
- Service dependency discovery must be testable with simulated service communication
- Auto-scaling events must be reproducible in test environments
- Deployment impact analysis must work with simulated before/after metrics

### Performance Expectations
- Support for monitoring hundreds of cloud resources across multiple providers
- Dependency mapping must handle at least 100 interconnected services
- Cost correlation must process usage data within 5 minutes of collection
- API response times for dependency queries under 1 second
- Minimal overhead on monitored services (less than 1% CPU, 50MB memory)
- Scales horizontally to support growing infrastructure without performance degradation

### Integration Points
- Cloud provider APIs (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring)
- Infrastructure-as-Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
- CI/CD systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI)

- Must work with ephemeral infrastructure that may exist for minutes to hours
- Should not require changes to application code for basic monitoring
- Must handle rapid infrastructure changes without manual reconfiguration
- Storage requirements should scale sublinearly with infrastructure growth

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system should consist of these core modules:

1. **Cloud Resource Monitor**
   - Multi-cloud resource discovery and classification

   - Cost estimation and correlation
   - Optimization recommendation engine
   - Resource lifecycle tracking

2. **IaC Integration Engine**
   - Infrastructure definition parsing
   - Automatic monitor configuration generation
   - Change detection and tracking
   - Tag and metadata standardization
   - Configuration version control integration

3. **Service Dependency Analyzer**
   - Network traffic analysis for dependency discovery
   - Service communication pattern identification
   - Dependency graph generation
   - Critical path analysis
   - Health impact propagation modeling

4. **Auto-scale Analytics Module**
   - Scaling event detection and logging
   - Pre/post scaling performance comparison
   - Scaling threshold analysis
   - Cost-impact analysis of scaling decisions
   - Scaling pattern anomaly detection

5. **Deployment Impact Evaluator**

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
