# Startup Cloud Infrastructure Monitor

A dynamic monitoring solution specifically designed for rapidly evolving cloud environments in startup companies, with focus on cost management, infrastructure code integration, and deployment impact analysis.

## Overview

The Startup Cloud Infrastructure Monitor is a specialized adaptation of the PyMonitor system tailored for DevOps engineers at startups who need to monitor rapidly changing cloud infrastructure. This implementation emphasizes cost correlation, infrastructure-as-code integration, microservice dependency tracking, auto-scaling metrics, and deployment performance impacts.

## Persona Description

Priya manages cloud infrastructure for a rapidly growing startup with evolving deployment needs. She needs lightweight monitoring that can scale with their system without requiring significant reconfiguration as architecture changes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Provider Cost Correlation** - Implement functionality to link system metrics to estimated billing impacts across cloud providers. This is critical for Priya as startups have limited budgets, and she needs to proactively identify unexpected cost increases, attribute them to specific services or features, and optimize cloud spending to extend the company's runway.

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Integration** - Create a system that can deploy monitoring alongside new resources using infrastructure-as-code tools. Priya requires this because her startup uses GitOps and IaC for all deployments; having monitoring automatically included with new infrastructure reduces overhead and ensures consistent observability across rapidly changing environments.

3. **Microservice Dependency Mapping** - Develop functionality to discover and visualize communication patterns between microservices. This capability is essential as Priya's startup's architecture involves dozens of microservices with complex interdependencies that change frequently, and understanding these relationships is crucial for troubleshooting cascading failures.

4. **Auto-Scaling Event Tracking** - Implement tracking of system load in relation to auto-scaling decisions. Priya needs this because her startup uses auto-scaling extensively to manage costs and performance, and she requires data to validate scaling policies, identify inefficiencies, and ensure appropriate resource allocation during peak demand.

5. **Deployment Impact Visualization** - Create capabilities to correlate system performance changes with new code deployments. This feature is crucial because Priya's startup deploys frequently using CI/CD pipelines, and she needs to quickly determine if new deployments are causing performance degradation or resource utilization changes.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with pytest without requiring actual cloud resources
- Cloud provider APIs must be abstracted and mockable for testing
- Infrastructure-as-code integrations must be verifiable with sample templates
- Performance impact analysis must be testable with synthetic metric data
- Dependency discovery must be validatable with predetermined service maps

### Performance Expectations
- Monitoring overhead must not exceed 1% of application resource utilization
- Metric collection intervals must be configurable from 10 seconds to 5 minutes
- API calls to cloud providers should be rate-limited to avoid excessive costs
- Dependency mapping should complete within 5 minutes for environments with up to 50 services
- Performance impact analysis should identify significant changes within 2 minutes of deployment

### Integration Points
- Cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- Infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI)
- Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, ECS)
- APM solutions for deeper application metrics

### Key Constraints
- Must adapt to rapidly changing infrastructure without manual reconfiguration
- Should minimize cloud API costs through efficient polling and caching
- Must work with ephemeral and serverless infrastructure
- Should not require privileged access to monitored systems
- Must operate with minimal persistent state to support stateless operation models

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

1. **Cloud Cost Management**
   - Cloud resource utilization tracking across providers
   - Cost estimation based on current utilization and provider pricing
   - Anomaly detection for unexpected cost increases
   - Resource efficiency recommendations
   - Trend analysis for budget forecasting

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code Monitoring**
   - Monitoring resource definition for popular IaC tools
   - Automated monitoring deployment with infrastructure
   - Configuration generation based on discovered resources
   - Version-aware monitoring updates
   - State drift detection between defined and actual monitoring

3. **Service Relationship Analysis**
   - Automated service discovery in dynamic environments
   - Network traffic analysis for dependency mapping
   - Communication pattern visualization data
   - Critical path identification
   - Dependency health impact assessment

4. **Scaling Metrics and Analysis**
   - Resource utilization tracking before and after scaling events
   - Scaling trigger analysis and validation
   - Right-sizing recommendations based on utilization patterns
   - Predictive scaling advice using historical patterns
   - Cost impact assessment of scaling policies

5. **Deployment Performance Impact**
   - Pre/post deployment metric comparison
   - Regression detection for key performance indicators
   - Resource utilization changes attributed to specific deployments
   - Performance impact trending across multiple deployments
   - Automatic rollback recommendations for severe degradations

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include comprehensive tests that validate:

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Accuracy of cloud cost estimations compared to actual billing
- Correctness of IaC monitoring resource generation
- Precision of dependency mapping compared to known relationships
- Reliability of scaling event correlation with system metrics
- Accuracy of deployment impact assessments

### Critical User Scenarios
- Identifying which specific microservices contribute most to cloud costs
- Automatically deploying appropriate monitoring with new infrastructure
- Tracing the impact of a failing service across dependent microservices
- Optimizing auto-scaling policies based on historical performance data
- Determining whether a recent deployment caused performance degradation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Resource overhead of the monitoring system itself
- Time to detect cost anomalies after they occur
- Latency of dependency map updates after service changes
- Speed of deployment impact analysis after new code releases
- Efficiency of IaC monitoring resource generation

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Behavior when cloud provider APIs are unavailable
- Recovery after monitoring system restarts in dynamic environments
- Handling of incomplete or corrupted metric data
- Adaptation to rapid infrastructure scaling events
- Response to sudden topology changes in microservice architectures

### Required Test Coverage
- 90% code coverage for core monitoring components
- 100% coverage for cloud cost estimation algorithms
- 95% coverage for IaC integration modules
- 90% coverage for dependency mapping logic
- 95% coverage for deployment impact analysis

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
