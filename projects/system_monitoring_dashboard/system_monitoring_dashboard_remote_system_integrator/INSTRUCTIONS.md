# Remote-Resilient Monitoring Platform

A robust monitoring solution designed for systems in remote locations with intermittent connectivity, optimized for bandwidth efficiency and offline operation.

## Overview

The Remote-Resilient Monitoring Platform is a specialized implementation of the PyMonitor system designed specifically for system integrators who manage infrastructure in remote locations with limited connectivity. It focuses on offline operation, bandwidth optimization, alternative alerting channels, edge processing, and reliable configuration management across unreliable networks.

## Persona Description

Jamal configures and maintains systems for clients in remote locations with limited connectivity. He needs reliable monitoring that works even with intermittent internet access and provides historical data when connections are reestablished.

## Key Requirements

1. **Offline Operation with Store-and-Forward Metrics** - Implement functionality to continue monitoring and locally store metrics during connectivity gaps, automatically forwarding them when connections are reestablished. This is critical for Jamal as his systems often experience internet outages but still need continuous monitoring, with complete historical data required for compliance and troubleshooting.

2. **Bandwidth-Aware Communication** - Develop optimized data transfer mechanisms that minimize bandwidth usage on limited connections. Jamal requires this capability because many of his client sites operate on expensive metered connections, satellite links, or cellular data, making efficient communication essential for cost control and reliable monitoring.

3. **SMS Alerting for Critical Issues** - Create an alternative alerting system that can send critical notifications via SMS when internet connectivity is unavailable. This feature is essential because Jamal needs to receive urgent alerts about critical system issues even when standard internet-based notification channels are down, ensuring timely response to emergencies.

4. **Edge Summarization for Data Reduction** - Implement pre-processing of metrics at the edge to reduce data volume before transmission. This is important for Jamal because sending raw monitoring data from hundreds of sensors would overwhelm limited connections; smart summarization ensures critical insights are transmitted while minimizing bandwidth requirements.

5. **Remote Configuration Updates** - Develop a system that can queue and reliably apply configuration changes when systems become reachable. Jamal needs this functionality because he must be able to update monitoring parameters, alerting thresholds, and collection frequencies without visiting remote sites, even when connections are intermittent.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with pytest without requiring actual remote hardware
- Network disruption scenarios must be simulatable for offline operation testing
- SMS gateway integration must support mocking for testing without actual SMS sending
- Edge processing algorithms must be verifiable with predefined data sets
- Configuration update mechanisms must be testable with simulated connectivity patterns

### Performance Expectations
- Local storage sufficient for at least 30 days of metrics during disconnection
- Bandwidth usage not exceeding configured limits (configurable from 1KB/hour to 1MB/hour)
- SMS alerts delivered within 5 minutes of critical events during internet outages
- Edge summarization reducing data volume by at least 80% while preserving critical patterns
- Configuration updates successfully applied within 5 minutes of connectivity restoration

### Integration Points
- SMS gateway services or GSM modems
- Satellite, cellular, and low-bandwidth network interfaces
- Local storage systems with data integrity protection
- Mesh networking capabilities where available
- Potential integration with radio or alternative communication systems

### Key Constraints
- Must function without internet access for extended periods (weeks to months)
- Must operate on limited hardware often found in remote locations
- Bandwidth usage must be strictly controllable and predictable
- Power efficiency is essential for systems on unreliable power sources
- All components must be resilient to sudden connection loss at any point

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Remote-Resilient Monitoring Platform must implement the following core functionality:

1. **Disconnection-Tolerant Operation**
   - Local metric collection and storage during connectivity loss
   - Intelligent data retention with configurable policies
   - Automatic synchronization upon connection restoration
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping data periods
   - Connection state detection and transition handling

2. **Efficient Data Communication**
   - Compression and delta encoding for metric transmission
   - Bandwidth usage scheduling and throttling
   - Priority-based transmission when bandwidth is limited
   - Background synchronization of historical data
   - Adaptive sampling based on available bandwidth

3. **Alternative Notification Systems**
   - SMS integration for critical alerts
   - Prioritization of alerts during limited connectivity
   - Message queuing and delivery confirmation
   - Fallback notification chains across multiple channels
   - Alert summarization to minimize message counts

4. **Edge Analytics and Processing**
   - Local anomaly detection without cloud dependencies
   - Statistical summarization of high-frequency metrics
   - Important pattern preservation during downsampling
   - Event correlation at the edge to reduce alert volume
   - Configurable preprocessing pipelines for different metric types

5. **Remote Management Capabilities**
   - Queued configuration change management
   - Atomic update application with validation
   - Rollback capabilities for failed configuration updates
   - Differential configuration synchronization
   - Out-of-band configuration channel support

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include comprehensive tests that validate:

### Key Functionalities Verification
- Completeness of data retention during extended offline periods
- Accuracy of bandwidth usage compared to configured limits
- Reliability of SMS alerting during simulated connectivity loss
- Effectiveness of edge summarization in preserving important patterns
- Success rate of configuration updates across various connectivity scenarios

### Critical User Scenarios
- Recovery after extended (30+ day) connectivity loss
- Operation over extremely limited bandwidth connections
- Alert delivery when primary communication channels fail
- Managing monitoring configuration across dozens of remote sites
- Analyzing data from remote systems for troubleshooting issues

### Performance Benchmarks
- Storage efficiency for offline data retention
- Bandwidth consumption under various monitoring loads
- Battery/power impact on remote systems
- Time to transmit critical alerts through alternative channels
- Synchronization speed when connectivity is restored

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Behavior during partial connectivity (high packet loss, intermittent connection)
- Recovery from storage corruption or capacity limits
- Handling of configuration conflicts during extended disconnection
- Adaptation to severely degraded network conditions
- Response to system time inconsistencies between disconnection periods

### Required Test Coverage
- 95% code coverage for core monitoring components
- 100% coverage for offline operation and data storage
- 100% coverage for bandwidth management algorithms
- 95% coverage for alternative notification systems
- 90% coverage for configuration management mechanisms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
