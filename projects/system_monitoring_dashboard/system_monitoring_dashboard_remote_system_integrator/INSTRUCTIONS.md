# Remote Site Monitoring System

## Overview
A resilient monitoring platform designed for systems in remote locations with limited connectivity that maintains offline operation capabilities, optimizes bandwidth usage, provides SMS alerts during connectivity outages, pre-processes data at the edge, and enables queued configuration updates that apply when systems become reachable.

## Persona Description
Jamal configures and maintains systems for clients in remote locations with limited connectivity. He needs reliable monitoring that works even with intermittent internet access and provides historical data when connections are reestablished.

## Key Requirements

1. **Offline Operation Capability**
   - Implement a store-and-forward mechanism that continues monitoring during connectivity outages
   - This is critical because remote systems often experience internet disruptions but still require continuous monitoring
   - The system must preserve historical data during offline periods and automatically synchronize when connectivity returns

2. **Bandwidth-Optimized Communication**
   - Create a data transmission system that minimizes bandwidth consumption for monitoring traffic
   - This is essential because remote locations often rely on expensive, metered, or low-bandwidth connections
   - Communications must prioritize critical alerts while efficiently batching routine data to minimize connection costs

3. **SMS Alert System**
   - Develop an SMS-based alerting mechanism for critical issues when internet connectivity is unavailable
   - This is vital because system administrators need to know about urgent problems even when primary connections are down
   - The SMS system must intelligently manage message frequency to control costs while ensuring critical notifications are delivered

4. **Edge Data Summarization**
   - Implement edge preprocessing capabilities that reduce data volume by summarizing metrics before transmission
   - This is important because sending raw monitoring data from remote locations is prohibitively expensive and inefficient
   - The summarization must preserve key insights and anomalies while significantly reducing data transfer requirements

5. **Remote Configuration Management**
   - Create a queued configuration system that can stage changes and apply them when systems become reachable
   - This is crucial because remote systems cannot always be immediately accessed for configuration updates
   - The management system must handle configuration conflicts and ensure eventual consistency across the monitored estate

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have unit tests with minimum 90% code coverage
  - Mock network conditions must simulate various connectivity scenarios (intermittent, low-bandwidth, high-latency)
  - Test fixtures for different remote system configurations and environments
  - Simulation framework for testing extended offline periods and synchronization
  - Parameterized tests for validating different data summarization strategies

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Local monitoring must continue with 100% reliability during connectivity outages
  - Data summarization must achieve at least 80% reduction in transmission volume
  - SMS alerts must be dispatched within 5 minutes of critical events
  - System must operate with at least 30 days of local storage for offline periods
  - Bandwidth usage must adapt dynamically to available connection quality

- **Integration Points**
  - SMS gateway APIs for alert delivery
  - Satellite, cellular, and other limited connectivity options
  - Local storage systems for offline data retention
  - Various remote system types (industrial controls, infrastructure components, specialized hardware)
  - Optional integration with VSAT, microwave, or radio communication systems

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must function with extremely limited bandwidth (as low as 2G cellular connections)
  - Cannot depend on continuous connectivity for core monitoring functions
  - Must operate within strict resource limitations of edge devices
  - Storage requirements must accommodate weeks or months of offline operation
  - Must be resilient to frequent connection disruptions and high-latency links

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. **Resilient Local Monitoring**
   - Continuous collection of system metrics regardless of connection status
   - Local alert evaluation to identify critical issues during offline periods
   - Efficient storage of historical data with automatic age-based compression
   - Self-healing monitoring that recovers after system restarts
   - Local backup of monitoring configuration and state

2. **Connection-Aware Transmission**
   - Dynamic detection of available bandwidth and connection quality
   - Prioritized transmission queue with critical data sent first
   - Bandwidth throttling to prevent monitoring from consuming all available connectivity
   - Incremental data synchronization when connections are reestablished
   - Transmission resumption from the point of failure

3. **Multi-Channel Alerting**
   - SMS message delivery for critical alerts during connectivity outages
   - Alert deduplication and rate limiting to control messaging costs
   - Fallback alert paths using alternative communication channels
   - Message prioritization based on alert severity and business impact
   - Confirmation tracking to ensure critical alerts are acknowledged

4. **Intelligent Data Reduction**
   - Statistical summarization of high-frequency metrics
   - Anomaly preservation during data compression
   - Configurable retention policies for different data categories
   - Progressive resolution reduction for older historical data
   - Metadata optimization to reduce transmission overhead

5. **Asynchronous Configuration Management**
   - Queueing system for configuration changes to offline systems
   - Conflict detection and resolution for overlapping configuration updates
   - Validation of configuration changes before and after application
   - Rollback capabilities for failed configuration deployments
   - Audit trail of configuration attempts and actual applied changes

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Continuity of monitoring during simulated connectivity failures
  - Efficiency of bandwidth optimization under various network conditions
  - Reliability of SMS alert delivery for critical events
  - Effectiveness of data summarization in reducing transmission volume
  - Success rate of queued configuration changes being correctly applied

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Monitoring remote systems through extended connectivity outages
  - Managing bandwidth costs while maintaining adequate monitoring coverage
  - Receiving urgent alerts when primary internet connections are down
  - Retrieving useful historical data from systems with intermittent connectivity
  - Deploying configuration updates to multiple remote sites with varying connection quality

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Local monitoring must function continuously through 30-day simulated connectivity outages
  - Bandwidth optimization must reduce data transmission by at least 80% compared to raw data
  - SMS alerts must successfully transmit within 5 minutes for 99% of critical events
  - Edge summarization must retain 95% of significant anomalies while reducing data by 80%
  - Configuration changes must successfully apply to 99% of remote systems within 24 hours of connectivity restoration

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - System behavior during extremely degraded network conditions (high packet loss, extreme latency)
  - Recovery after prolonged power outages affecting both monitoring and monitored systems
  - Handling of SMS transmission failures due to cellular network issues
  - Management of local storage exhaustion during extended offline periods
  - Conflict resolution when multiple contradictory configuration changes are queued

- **Test Coverage Requirements**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all components
  - 100% coverage for offline operation and data synchronization modules
  - All network failure scenarios must be thoroughly tested
  - SMS and alternative notification paths must have comprehensive test cases
  - Configuration conflict resolution logic must be thoroughly verified

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
