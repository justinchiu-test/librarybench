# Security-Focused System Monitoring Platform

## Overview
A specialized security monitoring system that focuses on detecting potential security threats through authentication monitoring, process relationship analysis, network connection tracking, file integrity monitoring, and security baseline compliance to help security analysts quickly identify and respond to suspicious system behavior.

## Persona Description
Elena focuses on security monitoring across company infrastructure. She needs visibility into potentially suspicious system behavior patterns and security-relevant events.

## Key Requirements

1. **Authentication Failure Monitoring with Geolocation**
   - Implement comprehensive tracking of authentication attempts with geolocation context for identifying suspicious login patterns
   - This is critical because unauthorized access attempts often originate from unexpected geographic locations
   - The monitoring must detect brute force attempts, credential stuffing, and unusual login patterns that may indicate compromise

2. **Process Lineage Tracking**
   - Create a monitoring component that tracks parent-child process relationships to identify unusual execution chains
   - This is essential because malware and attackers often use unexpected process relationships to execute malicious code
   - The tracking must establish baseline process behaviors and highlight deviations that could indicate compromise

3. **Network Connection Visualization**
   - Develop a system to monitor and analyze outbound network connections to detect unexpected communications
   - This is vital because malware frequently establishes command and control connections or exfiltrates data
   - The visualization must identify unusual destination IPs, ports, protocols, and connection patterns that deviate from normal behavior

4. **File Integrity Monitoring**
   - Implement a file monitoring system that detects unauthorized changes to critical system and application files
   - This is important because attackers often modify system files to maintain persistence or alter system behavior
   - The monitoring must establish cryptographic baselines for critical files and report any unauthorized modifications

5. **Security Baseline Comparison**
   - Create a configuration assessment system that compares current system settings against security hardening baselines
   - This is crucial because security configuration drift can introduce vulnerabilities and compliance issues
   - The comparison must identify deviations from security best practices and organizational policy requirements

## Technical Requirements

- **Testability Requirements**
  - All components must have unit tests with minimum 90% code coverage
  - Test fixtures must simulate various security scenarios and attack patterns
  - Mock objects for geolocation services, network traffic, and process monitoring
  - Integration tests must verify proper detection of simulated security events
  - Test cases must cover both true positive and false positive scenarios

- **Performance Expectations**
  - Authentication monitoring must detect and alert on suspicious patterns within 60 seconds
  - Process relationship analysis must identify abnormal process chains within 30 seconds
  - Network connection analysis must detect unusual traffic within 2 minutes of occurrence
  - File integrity checking must complete full system scans within 1 hour on standard systems
  - Security baseline assessments must complete within 30 minutes per system

- **Integration Points**
  - Authentication system logs (Windows Event Logs, syslog, auth.log)
  - Process monitoring interfaces (procfs, WMI, etc.)
  - Network packet capture or flow monitoring interfaces
  - File system access for integrity monitoring
  - Configuration management databases or repositories

- **Key Constraints**
  - Must minimize false positives while maintaining high detection rates
  - Cannot significantly impact system performance or create excessive load
  - Must operate with least privilege principles to avoid creating security vulnerabilities
  - Storage requirements must accommodate long-term retention for forensic analysis
  - Must comply with privacy regulations regarding geolocation and user monitoring

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. **Authentication Security Analysis**
   - Collection and parsing of authentication logs across different systems
   - Geolocation lookup for source IP addresses of login attempts
   - Pattern detection for brute force and credential stuffing attacks
   - User behavior profiling to identify unusual login patterns
   - Correlation of authentication events across multiple systems

2. **Process Behavior Monitoring**
   - Real-time tracking of process creation and termination events
   - Parent-child relationship mapping and unusual chain detection
   - Process execution timing and sequence analysis
   - Command-line parameter monitoring for suspicious arguments
   - Behavioral baselining and anomaly detection for processes

3. **Network Traffic Intelligence**
   - Monitoring of outbound connection attempts from all systems
   - Destination IP reputation and categorization analysis
   - Protocol and port usage profiling
   - Data volume and timing pattern analysis
   - Correlation of network activity with process behavior

4. **File Change Detection**
   - Cryptographic hash generation for critical system files
   - Scheduled and on-demand integrity verification
   - Permission and ownership change monitoring
   - Whitelisting of expected file modifications (patches, updates)
   - Detailed change auditing for forensic investigation

5. **Security Configuration Assessment**
   - Definition of security baselines for different system types
   - Regular comparison of current configuration against baselines
   - Prioritization of deviations based on security impact
   - Compliance mapping to security frameworks (CIS, NIST, etc.)
   - Historical tracking of configuration changes and remediation

## Testing Requirements

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**
  - Accuracy of suspicious authentication detection with geolocation context
  - Precision of abnormal process relationship identification
  - Reliability of detecting unusual network connections
  - Effectiveness of file integrity monitoring and change detection
  - Comprehensiveness of security baseline deviation reporting

- **Critical User Scenarios**
  - Detecting a brute force authentication attempt from an unusual location
  - Identifying malicious processes spawning unexpected child processes
  - Detecting data exfiltration through abnormal network connections
  - Discovering unauthorized modifications to critical system files
  - Identifying systems that have drifted from security baseline configurations

- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - Authentication monitoring must process at least 1000 login events per minute
  - Process relationship tracking must handle at least 100 process creations per second
  - Network connection analysis must process at least 10,000 connections per minute
  - File integrity monitoring must verify at least 10,000 files per hour
  - Security baseline assessments must check at least 200 configuration items per minute

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**
  - System behavior during extremely high volumes of security events
  - Handling of unreachable geolocation services or reputation databases
  - Management of conflicting or ambiguous security baseline requirements
  - Recovery after monitoring interruptions to ensure no security gaps
  - Proper functionality with degraded permissions or restricted access

- **Test Coverage Requirements**
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all components
  - 100% coverage for critical security detection algorithms
  - All alert generation paths must have dedicated test cases
  - False positive scenarios must be thoroughly tested
  - Edge cases involving high volumes or degraded conditions must be verified

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

1. Detect at least 95% of simulated suspicious authentication attempts within 60 seconds
2. Identify at least 90% of abnormal process relationship patterns in test scenarios
