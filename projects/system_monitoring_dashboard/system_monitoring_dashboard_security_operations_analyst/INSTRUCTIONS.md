# Security-Focused System Monitoring Platform

A specialized monitoring solution designed to detect, analyze, and alert on security-relevant system behaviors and potentially suspicious activities across an organization's infrastructure.

## Overview

The Security-Focused System Monitoring Platform is a tailored implementation of the PyMonitor system that concentrates on security-relevant metrics and behaviors. It provides security operations analysts with detailed visibility into authentication attempts, process relationships, network communications, file integrity, and security configuration drift to help identify potential security incidents and vulnerabilities.

## Persona Description

Elena focuses on security monitoring across company infrastructure. She needs visibility into potentially suspicious system behavior patterns and security-relevant events.

## Key Requirements

1. **Authentication Failure Monitoring with Geolocation** - Implement functionality to track failed login attempts across systems with geographic context. This is critical for Elena because unusual authentication attempts from unexpected locations are often the first indicator of account compromise, and immediate detection with location data enables faster threat assessment and response.

2. **Process Lineage Tracking** - Develop capabilities to monitor and highlight unusual parent-child process relationships. Elena needs this because sophisticated attacks often involve abnormal process spawning patterns, and understanding process lineage helps identify malicious code execution that standard monitoring might miss.

3. **Network Connection Visualization** - Create a system to track and identify unexpected outbound communications from monitored systems. This capability is essential because malware and data exfiltration typically involve network connections to unusual destinations, and Elena needs to quickly identify potentially compromised systems attempting unauthorized communications.

4. **File Integrity Monitoring** - Implement functionality to detect and alert on changes to critical system files. This is crucial for Elena as unauthorized modifications to system files are a common indicator of compromise, and early detection of such changes can prevent further system exploitation and damage.

5. **Security Baseline Comparison** - Develop a system to track and report system configuration drift from hardened security standards. Elena requires this because maintaining secure configurations across systems is essential for security posture, and identifying systems that have deviated from security baselines helps prioritize remediation efforts.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All security monitoring components must be testable with pytest
- Authentication monitoring must be testable with simulated login attempt data
- Process relationship detection must validate against known malicious patterns
- Network monitoring must allow testing with predefined connection scenarios
- File integrity checking must verify detection of various modification types

### Performance Expectations
- Near real-time detection of security events (within 30 seconds)
- Minimal false positive rate (<1%) while maintaining high detection sensitivity
- Efficient processing of authentication logs from hundreds of systems
- Lightweight process monitoring with minimal impact on system performance
- Network connection analysis capable of handling systems with thousands of connections

### Integration Points
- Authentication systems and directory services
- System logging frameworks and SIEM systems
- Process monitoring APIs across different operating systems
- Network flow data from firewalls and network devices

- Detecting unauthorized modifications to critical system files during an attack
- Prioritizing systems with the most significant security configuration drift

### Performance Benchmarks
- Time to detect and alert on authentication anomalies
- Resource impact of continuous process monitoring
- Efficiency of network connection analysis under heavy traffic
- Speed of file integrity verification across large file sets
- Performance of configuration baselines checks across diverse systems

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Behavior during high volumes of authentication failures (DoS scenarios)
- Handling of process monitoring during system high load conditions
- Network analysis during unusual but legitimate traffic patterns
- File integrity checking with corrupted or inaccessible files
- Baseline comparison with partially collected configuration data

### Required Test Coverage
- 95% code coverage for authentication monitoring components
- 95% coverage for process lineage tracking logic
- 90% coverage for network connection analysis algorithms
- 95% coverage for file integrity verification
