# Security-Focused Monitoring Platform

A specialized monitoring solution that emphasizes security event detection, suspicious behavior analysis, and system integrity validation.

## Overview

This implementation of PyMonitor is designed specifically for security operations, focusing on authentication failure monitoring, process lineage tracking, network connection visualization, file integrity monitoring, and security baseline comparison to enable effective threat detection and security incident response.

## Persona Description

Elena focuses on security monitoring across company infrastructure. She needs visibility into potentially suspicious system behavior patterns and security-relevant events.

## Key Requirements

1. **Authentication Failure Monitoring with Geolocation**
   - Track failed login attempts across systems with IP geolocation context
   - Detect brute force and password spraying patterns
   - Identify unusual login times or locations for valid accounts
   - Correlate authentication failures across multiple systems
   - Generate risk scores based on authentication patterns
   - This is critical because authentication-related attacks are one of the most common initial access vectors for security breaches.

2. **Process Lineage Tracking**
   - Monitor parent-child process relationships across systems
   - Detect unusual process spawning patterns
   - Identify potentially malicious command line arguments
   - Track process execution chains from initial entry points
   - Generate alerts for suspicious process behavior
   - This is critical because understanding process relationships helps identify living-off-the-land techniques and other sophisticated attack methods that leverage legitimate system processes.

3. **Network Connection Visualization**
   - Monitor and visualize internal and external network connections
   - Detect unusual or unauthorized network communication
   - Track data flow volumes and patterns between systems
   - Identify potential command-and-control or data exfiltration channels
   - Generate baseline network maps and alert on deviations
   - This is critical because unexpected network connections often indicate compromise, lateral movement, or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **File Integrity Monitoring**
   - Track changes to critical system files and configurations
   - Calculate and validate file hashes to detect unauthorized modifications
   - Log file change details including timestamps and responsible processes
   - Provide file change history with comparison capabilities
   - Support custom rules for monitoring specific file patterns
   - This is critical because system file modifications are common indicators of persistence mechanisms and other malicious activities.

5. **Security Baseline Comparison**
   - Define and enforce security configuration baselines
   - Detect and report deviations from hardened standards
   - Score system security posture against defined benchmarks
   - Track security configuration changes over time
   - Generate compliance reports for security standards
   - This is critical because system misconfigurations or security control disablements are frequent contributors to successful attacks and policy violations.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All security monitoring components must be testable with simulated security events
- Authentication monitoring must be testable with mock login data and geolocation
- Process lineage must be verifiable with predefined process hierarchies
- Network monitoring must be testable with simulated connection data
- File integrity checking must work with test file sets
- Baseline comparison must validate against defined security standards

### Performance Expectations
- Real-time detection of security events (within 10 seconds of occurrence)
- Ability to process at least 1000 authentication events per second
- Track process lineage for at least 10,000 processes per monitored system
- Monitor network connections across 1000+ endpoints with minimal latency
- File integrity checking with minimal system impact (less than 2% CPU utilization)
- Support for at least 100 concurrent security baseline checks

### Integration Points
- Authentication systems (LDAP, Active Directory, local auth logs)
- Process monitoring facilities (procfs, Windows WMI, sysmon)
- Network monitoring tools (netflow, pcap, socket statistics)
- File system monitoring capabilities (inotify, FSEvents, USN journal)
- Security configuration standards (CIS benchmarks, DISA STIGs)
- IP geolocation databases and services

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with minimal elevated privileges
- Cannot significantly impact system performance during monitoring
- Must support multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Should function without constant connectivity to a central server
- Must maintain accurate audit trails for security events
- Should minimize storage requirements for long-term event history

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system should consist of these core modules:

1. **Authentication Monitor**
   - Authentication event collection and normalization
   - IP geolocation resolution and enrichment
   - Pattern detection for brute force and credential stuffing
   - User behavior profiling and anomaly detection
   - Risk scoring and alerting for suspicious authentication

2. **Process Tracker**
   - Process creation and termination monitoring
   - Parent-child relationship mapping
   - Command line and argument analysis
   - Process behavior profiling
   - Suspicious execution chain detection

3. **Network Analyzer**
   - Connection establishment and termination tracking
   - Traffic flow analysis and baselining
   - Destination categorization and risk assessment
   - Protocol analysis and validation
   - Anomalous connection detection

4. **File Integrity Checker**
   - File change detection and validation
   - Hash calculation and verification
   - Change attribution to users and processes
   - Historical comparison capabilities
   - Critical file prioritization

5. **Security Configuration Validator**
   - Baseline definition and management
   - Configuration scanning and comparison
   - Compliance scoring and reporting
   - Remediation guidance for deviations
   - Change tracking and drift detection

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate detection of authentication-based attacks

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling high-volume authentication failure events during attacks

- Correctly attributing file changes during concurrent modifications
- Handling partially applicable security baselines in mixed environments

### Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% code coverage across all security modules
- 100% coverage of authentication pattern detection algorithms
- 100% coverage of process relationship mapping logic
- 100% coverage of network anomaly detection

- 95% coverage of security baseline comparison logic

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
