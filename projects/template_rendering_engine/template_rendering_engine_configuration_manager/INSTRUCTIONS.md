# PyTemplate for Configuration Management

## Overview
A specialized template rendering engine for generating configuration files across multiple formats and environments, with secure secret handling, validation, and comprehensive diff capabilities for DevOps teams.

## Persona Description
A DevOps engineer generating configuration files for different environments who needs secure secret handling and validation. He wants templates that can produce YAML, JSON, and XML configs with environment-specific values.

## Key Requirements
1. **Multi-format serialization (YAML, JSON, XML, TOML)**: The engine must generate configuration files in various formats from a single template source, maintaining format-specific conventions and features. This is critical for managing diverse infrastructure where different tools require different configuration formats.

2. **Secret value masking with secure interpolation**: Implement secure handling of sensitive values with masking in logs/output while maintaining proper interpolation at runtime. This is essential for preventing accidental exposure of passwords, API keys, and other secrets in version control or logs.

3. **Schema validation for generated configurations**: Built-in validation against JSON Schema, XML Schema, or custom validators to ensure generated configurations meet requirements before deployment. This prevents invalid configurations from breaking production systems.

4. **Environment hierarchy with value inheritance**: Support for complex environment hierarchies (base -> staging -> production) with proper value inheritance and overrides. This enables DRY configuration management across multiple deployment environments.

5. **Diff generation between configuration versions**: Generate human-readable diffs between configuration versions, highlighting changes in a format suitable for code reviews. This is crucial for change management and audit requirements.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability**: All configuration generation and validation logic must be testable via pytest with mock secret stores
- **Performance**: Must handle large configuration sets with hundreds of parameters efficiently
- **Integration**: Clean API for integration with secret management systems and CI/CD pipelines
- **Key Constraints**: No UI components; must maintain format fidelity; support for encrypted values at rest

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The template engine must provide:
- Format-agnostic template system with serialization to YAML, JSON, XML, and TOML
- Secret management interface with pluggable backends (environment vars, files, mock stores)
- Schema validation system supporting multiple schema formats
- Environment hierarchy resolver with deep merging capabilities
- Configuration diff generator with semantic understanding of changes
- Template variable resolver with circular dependency detection
- Format-specific features (YAML anchors, JSON comments via conventions, etc.)
- Audit trail generation for configuration changes

## Testing Requirements
All components must be thoroughly tested with pytest, including:
- **Serialization tests**: Verify correct output in all supported formats
- **Secret handling tests**: Validate secure interpolation and masking behavior
- **Schema validation tests**: Ensure proper validation against various schema types
- **Inheritance tests**: Verify correct value resolution across environment hierarchies
- **Diff generation tests**: Validate accurate and readable diff output
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark large configuration generation
- **Edge cases**: Handle circular references, missing values, invalid schemas
- **Security tests**: Ensure secrets are never exposed in logs or error messages

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation is successful when:
- Generates valid configurations in YAML, JSON, XML, and TOML formats
- Secrets are properly masked in all output while maintaining functionality
- Schema validation catches 100% of invalid configurations
- Environment inheritance correctly resolves values across 5+ hierarchy levels
- Diffs clearly show configuration changes in review-friendly format
- Large configurations (1000+ parameters) generate in under 5 seconds
- All tests pass with comprehensive security validation

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a new virtual environment using `uv venv` from within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project in development mode with `uv pip install -e .`
4. Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate the required results file
