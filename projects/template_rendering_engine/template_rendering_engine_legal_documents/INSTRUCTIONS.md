# PyTemplate for Legal Document Generation

## Overview
A specialized template rendering engine for creating complex legal documents with precise control over document structure, conditional clauses, and multi-language support, designed for legal professionals managing contract templates.

## Persona Description
A legal professional creating contract templates who needs precise control over document structure and clauses. She requires templates that can handle complex conditional logic and maintain legal formatting requirements.

## Key Requirements
1. **Clause library with conditional inclusion logic**: Implement a comprehensive clause management system where clauses can be conditionally included based on contract type, jurisdiction, and party attributes. This is critical for creating legally compliant documents that adapt to specific situations while maintaining consistency.

2. **Legal citation formatting and validation**: Automatically format legal citations according to jurisdiction-specific standards (Bluebook, OSCOLA, etc.) and validate references against known legal databases. This ensures professional compliance and reduces manual citation errors.

3. **Document versioning with redline generation**: Track all document changes and generate redline versions showing additions, deletions, and modifications between versions. This is essential for contract negotiations where parties need to review changes clearly.

4. **Multilingual contract generation**: Support for generating contracts in multiple languages with proper legal terminology translation and maintaining paragraph numbering across languages. This enables international business transactions with locally compliant documentation.

5. **Digital signature placeholder integration**: Generate documents with properly formatted signature blocks and integration markers for digital signature platforms (DocuSign, Adobe Sign). This facilitates seamless transition from document generation to execution.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability**: All document generation and formatting logic must be testable via pytest
- **Performance**: Must handle complex documents (100+ pages) with nested clauses efficiently
- **Integration**: Clean API for integration with document management systems and signature platforms
- **Key Constraints**: No UI components; must maintain precise formatting; support for legal document standards

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The template engine must provide:
- Clause library system with metadata, tags, and version control
- Conditional logic engine supporting complex boolean expressions
- Legal citation formatter with multiple style guides
- Document version tracker with detailed change history
- Redline generator producing track-changes style output
- Multi-language template system with terminology management
- Signature block generator with platform-specific metadata
- Hierarchical numbering system maintaining consistency across operations

## Testing Requirements
All components must be thoroughly tested with pytest, including:
- **Clause inclusion tests**: Verify correct conditional logic evaluation and clause selection
- **Citation formatting tests**: Validate accurate formatting for different citation styles
- **Version tracking tests**: Ensure complete and accurate change detection
- **Redline generation tests**: Verify readable and accurate change visualization
- **Multi-language tests**: Validate consistent structure across language versions
- **Signature placeholder tests**: Ensure correct formatting for different platforms
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark generation of large complex documents
- **Legal compliance tests**: Verify output meets formatting standards

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation is successful when:
- Clause library correctly applies complex conditional logic
- Legal citations format accurately for multiple style guides
- Document versions track all changes with perfect fidelity
- Redline generation clearly shows all document modifications
- Multi-language documents maintain structural consistency
- Signature placeholders integrate with major signing platforms
- Large documents (100+ pages) generate in under 15 seconds
- All tests pass with comprehensive legal formatting validation

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a new virtual environment using `uv venv` from within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project in development mode with `uv pip install -e .`
4. Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate the required results file
