# Accessibility Compliance Test Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for accessibility specialists who ensure applications meet accessibility standards and work well with assistive technologies. The framework provides WCAG compliance validation, screen reader simulation, keyboard navigation testing, color contrast verification, and timed operation validation to comprehensively assess application accessibility.

## Persona Description
Miguel ensures applications meet accessibility standards and works well with assistive technologies. He needs specialized testing capabilities focused on accessibility compliance and user experience for people with disabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **WCAG compliance validation**: Create an automated system for checking against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standards. This is critical for Miguel because WCAG conformance is the foundation of accessibility compliance, and automated validation helps identify common violations efficiently without requiring manual inspection of every element.

2. **Screen reader simulation**: Implement tools to verify content is properly exposed to assistive technologies. This feature is essential because screen reader users rely on correctly structured and labeled content, and simulation verifies that information is properly exposed to assistive technologies without requiring extensive manual testing.

3. **Keyboard navigation testing**: Develop functionality for ensuring full application operation without mouse interaction. This capability is vital because many users with motor disabilities rely exclusively on keyboard navigation, and these tests ensure all features remain accessible without requiring pointing devices.

4. **Color contrast and text size verification**: Build tools for visual accessibility requirement verification. This feature is crucial because users with low vision or color blindness rely on proper contrast and text sizing, and these checks ensure content remains perceivable across a range of visual abilities.

5. **Timed operation testing**: Create validation systems ensuring time-dependent functions have appropriate accommodations. This is important because users with various disabilities may require additional time to complete operations, and these tests verify that timed functions include proper extensions, warnings, or bypasses as required by accessibility standards.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Emulation of assistive technology interaction
  - Programmatic DOM structure analysis
  - Keyboard event simulation and verification
  - Color and contrast analysis capabilities
  - Timing operation monitoring and validation

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - WCAG validation completed in under 2 minutes for typical applications
  - Screen reader simulation with minimal performance impact
  - Keyboard navigation tests execute at near-human speed
  - Visual analysis processing completes in under 5 seconds per screen
  - Timing tests accurately measure user interaction windows

- **Integration Points**:
  - DOM manipulation and monitoring
  - Assistive technology APIs
  - Color analysis and image processing libraries
  - Keyboard event handling
  - Application state monitoring

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No UI/UX components, all functionality exposed as Python APIs
  - Must work with various application technologies (web, desktop, mobile)
  - Minimal performance impact on the application under test
  - Must provide actionable remediation guidance
  - Should support incremental testing for ongoing development

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The framework must implement these core capabilities:

1. **WCAG Compliance Engine**:
   - Success criteria validation
   - Automatic recognition of common patterns
   - Rule-based violation detection
   - Severity classification
   - Remediation recommendation

2. **Assistive Technology Simulation**:
   - Screen reader content exposure verification
   - Accessibility API interaction
   - Element role and state examination
   - Focus and reading order tracking
   - Alternative text evaluation

3. **Keyboard Accessibility Framework**:
   - Focus management verification
   - Keyboard trap detection
   - Shortcut and access key validation
   - Navigation path analysis
   - Interaction completeness verification

4. **Visual Accessibility Analysis**:
   - Color contrast calculation
   - Text size measurement
   - Color blindness simulation
   - Visual formatting evaluation
   - Responsive scaling verification

5. **Temporal Accessibility Validation**:
   - Timeout detection and measurement
   - Timing adjustment verification
   - Progress indication analysis
   - Interruption handling
   - Session management validation

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive tests that verify:

- **Key Functionalities**:
  - WCAG validation correctly identifies accessibility violations
  - Screen reader simulation accurately detects content exposure issues
  - Keyboard navigation testing finds all keyboard accessibility barriers
  - Visual analysis properly measures contrast and text size issues
  - Timing validation identifies operations without proper accommodations

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Accessibility specialist runs comprehensive compliance check against WCAG standards
  - Application content is evaluated for proper exposure to screen readers
  - Interactive elements are tested for keyboard accessibility
  - Visual design is analyzed for color contrast compliance
  - Time-limited operations are checked for appropriate accommodations

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - WCAG validation processes 100+ pages in under 10 minutes
  - Screen reader simulation adds less than 20% overhead to test execution
  - Keyboard navigation tests complete a typical user flow in under 3 minutes
  - Visual analysis processes 10+ screens in under a minute
  - Timing validation accurately measures timeout periods within 100ms precision

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of dynamic content that changes during testing
  - Proper analysis of custom interactive elements
  - Graceful behavior with malformed accessibility information
  - Appropriate handling of internationalized content
  - Recovery from interrupted test execution

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria
  - 100% coverage of common screen reader interaction patterns
  - 100% coverage of keyboard navigation verification
  - 100% coverage of visual accessibility requirements
  - 100% coverage of timing-related accessibility requirements

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. WCAG validation identifies at least 90% of accessibility violations compared to expert manual testing
2. Screen reader simulation correctly assesses content exposure with at least 85% accuracy
3. Keyboard navigation testing identifies at least 95% of keyboard accessibility barriers
4. Visual analysis correctly measures color contrast with at least 98% accuracy
5. Timing validation properly identifies all time-limited operations without appropriate accommodations
6. The framework can test applications using at least 3 different technology stacks
7. Testing provides clear, actionable remediation guidance for each identified issue
8. Full accessibility testing completes in less than 20% of the time required for manual assessment
9. All functionality is accessible programmatically through well-defined Python APIs
10. The framework can be used to monitor accessibility compliance throughout the development lifecycle
