# Accessibility Compliance Testing Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for accessibility specialists who need to verify application compliance with accessibility standards and ensure usability with assistive technologies. This framework provides comprehensive testing for accessibility requirements with particular focus on standards compliance, assistive technology compatibility, and inclusive user experience.

## Persona Description
Miguel ensures applications meet accessibility standards and works well with assistive technologies. He needs specialized testing capabilities focused on accessibility compliance and user experience for people with disabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **WCAG compliance validation automatically checking for accessibility standard violations** - Essential for Miguel to systematically verify adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines across an entire application, automatically detecting violations related to structure, semantics, navigation, and interactive elements without requiring manual inspection of each page.

2. **Screen reader simulation verifying content is properly exposed to assistive technologies** - Critical for ensuring application content and functionality is accessible to users who rely on screen readers, checking that all information and controls are properly announced with correct reading order, semantic roles, and contextual information.

3. **Keyboard navigation testing ensuring full functionality without mouse interaction** - Necessary to verify that all application features can be accessed and operated using only keyboard controls, confirming proper focus management, visible focus indicators, logical tab order, and keyboard-specific interaction patterns.

4. **Color contrast and text size verification for visual accessibility requirements** - Helps identify visual accessibility issues by automatically evaluating color contrast ratios between text and backgrounds, verifying text scaling behavior, and checking for content that relies solely on color to convey information.

5. **Timed operation testing validating that time-dependent functions have appropriate accommodations** - Ensures that features with time constraints or automatic timeouts provide sufficient options for users who need more time, verifying the presence of pause/extend mechanisms and appropriate warnings before session expiration.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**
  - Tests must validate against current WCAG standards (2.0 AA, 2.1 AA, and beyond)
  - Components must expose their accessibility tree for programmatic inspection
  - Test fixtures must support simulation of different assistive technologies
  - Framework must verify both static and dynamic content accessibility
  - Tests must support validation of custom ARIA attributes and roles

- **Performance expectations**
  - Accessibility scanning should complete in under 5 seconds per page/view
  - Screen reader simulation should process content at a rate similar to actual screen readers
  - Color contrast analysis should evaluate up to 1000 elements per second
  - Keyboard navigation testing should execute complete workflows in reasonable time
  - Test suite execution should not add significant overhead to normal application operation

- **Integration points**
  - Assistive technology APIs and simulation tools
  - UI automation frameworks for control interaction
  - Visual inspection tools for contrast analysis
  - Accessibility standards databases and rule engines
  - Reporting systems for compliance documentation

- **Key constraints**
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through APIs
  - Must not require modification of the application under test
  - Should work across different application technologies
  - Must validate against current and past accessibility standards
  - Should provide actionable feedback for identified issues

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The framework needs to implement:

1. **WCAG Compliance Validator**: A comprehensive rule engine that checks application elements against accessibility guidelines, identifying violations and suggesting remediation approaches.

2. **Accessibility Tree Inspector**: Tools to examine the accessibility object model exposed by applications to assistive technologies, verifying proper element roles, properties, states, and relationships.

3. **Screen Reader Interaction Simulator**: Components that simulate how screen readers would process and announce application content, validating reading order, context preservation, and appropriate descriptions.

4. **Keyboard Navigation Analyzer**: Systems to verify keyboard accessibility by testing focus management, tab order, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to operate all controls without a mouse.

5. **Visual Accessibility Evaluator**: Tools to analyze color contrast ratios, text sizing capabilities, and other visual accessibility factors across different viewport sizes and zoom levels.

6. **Timing Accommodation Validator**: Logic to test applications for appropriate handling of timed operations, verifying the presence and functionality of mechanisms to pause, extend, or adjust timing constraints.

7. **Accessibility Report Generator**: Components to produce detailed compliance reports with issue categorization, severity assessment, and remediation guidance.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**
  - Accurate identification of WCAG compliance violations
  - Proper simulation of screen reader interaction patterns
  - Correct validation of keyboard navigation pathways
  - Accurate measurement of color contrast ratios
  - Proper verification of timing accommodation mechanisms

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**
  - Navigating an application using only keyboard controls
  - Accessing application content through simulated screen readers
  - Evaluating applications with dynamically generated content
  - Verifying form completion and submission with assistive technologies
  - Testing interactive elements for proper accessibility properties

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**
  - WCAG compliance scanning should process at least 500 DOM elements per second
  - Screen reader simulation should evaluate at least 200 elements per second
  - Keyboard navigation testing should execute at least 50 interactions per second
  - Visual accessibility testing should analyze at least 100 elements per second
  - Test suite execution should complete a full application scan in under 1 hour

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**
  - Applications with custom controls and non-standard interaction patterns
  - Dynamically updated content that changes the accessibility tree
  - Complex widgets with nested interactive elements
  - Canvas-based or WebGL content with limited built-in accessibility
  - Animation and transition effects that impact accessibility

- **Required test coverage metrics**
  - Standards coverage: Tests must verify all applicable WCAG success criteria
  - Interaction coverage: Tests must verify all interaction patterns (keyboard, touch, etc.)
  - Control coverage: Tests must verify all types of UI controls in the application
  - Viewport coverage: Tests must verify behavior across different viewport sizes
  - Assistive technology coverage: Tests must verify compatibility with major assistive technologies

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The framework correctly identifies at least 95% of WCAG violations in test applications
2. Screen reader simulation accurately reflects how real screen readers would process content
3. Keyboard navigation testing identifies all keyboard accessibility issues without false positives
4. Color contrast and visual accessibility testing correctly evaluates foreground/background combinations
5. Timing accommodation validation accurately identifies issues with time-constrained operations
6. Reports provide clear, actionable information for remediating identified issues
7. All functionality is accessible through well-defined APIs without requiring UI components
