# Accessibility Compliance Test Automation Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for accessibility specialists who ensure applications meet accessibility standards and work well with assistive technologies. This framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities focused on accessibility compliance, simulated assistive technology interactions, and user experience for people with disabilities.

## Persona Description
Miguel ensures applications meet accessibility standards and works well with assistive technologies. He needs specialized testing capabilities focused on accessibility compliance and user experience for people with disabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **WCAG compliance validation automatically checking for accessibility standard violations**
   - Critical for ensuring applications meet legal and regulatory accessibility requirements
   - Provides systematic verification against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) criteria
   - Identifies compliance issues early in the development process before they become costly to fix

2. **Screen reader simulation verifying content is properly exposed to assistive technologies**
   - Ensures applications are usable by people who rely on screen readers
   - Validates that all content and functionality is available through programmatic interfaces
   - Tests real-world screen reader interaction patterns without manual testing

3. **Keyboard navigation testing ensuring full functionality without mouse interaction**
   - Verifies that all features can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard
   - Confirms proper focus management and logical tab order throughout the application
   - Identifies keyboard traps and unreachable functionality

4. **Color contrast and text size verification for visual accessibility requirements**
   - Validates that text meets minimum contrast ratios for readability by people with low vision
   - Ensures scalability of text without loss of functionality
   - Tests for color-dependent information that might be inaccessible to color-blind users

5. **Timed operation testing validating that time-dependent functions have appropriate accommodations**
   - Verifies that users who need more time can complete time-limited operations
   - Ensures timeout warnings and extension mechanisms are properly implemented
   - Tests for accommodations for users with cognitive, reading, physical, or language limitations

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Framework must evaluate compliance with current WCAG standards (2.0/2.1 AA minimum)
  - Tests must simulate interaction patterns of common assistive technologies
  - Framework must analyze content rendering and structure programmatically
  - Tests must be executable in various view states and device conditions

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - WCAG compliance checks must complete in < 30 seconds per view or page
  - Screen reader simulation must process content at rates similar to actual screen readers
  - Keyboard navigation testing must identify focus order issues within 10 seconds
  - Visual analysis for contrast and text size verification must process UIs at 5+ views per second

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must work with application content in standard formats (HTML, PDF, UI component trees)
  - Should integrate with development tools and continuous integration pipelines
  - Must support export to accessibility compliance report formats
  - Should provide hooks for custom accessibility rule implementation

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must remain current with evolving accessibility standards
  - Framework must operate without requiring specialized accessibility hardware
  - Solution should minimize false positives/negatives in compliance validation
  - Tests must be executable by developers without deep accessibility expertise

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

  - Verifying complete keyboard accessibility for motor-impaired users
  - Assessing readability for users with vision impairments
  - Confirming accommodations for users who need additional time

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - WCAG validation rules must process 50+ success criteria in < 30 seconds
  - Screen reader simulation must achieve 95%+ accuracy compared to popular screen readers
  - Keyboard testing must identify 98%+ of navigation and operability issues
  - Visual analysis must achieve 99%+ accuracy on contrast ratio calculations
  - Timeout testing must detect timing issues with 95%+ reliability

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling dynamic content that changes in response to user interaction
  - Testing applications with non-standard UI frameworks or custom controls
  - Appropriate behavior when encountering encrypted or protected content
  - Accurate testing of content with mixed accessibility support
  - Correct operation with internationalized content and right-to-left languages

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - WCAG compliance validation: 100% coverage of AA success criteria
  - Screen reader simulation components: 95% coverage
  - Keyboard accessibility testing: 100% coverage
  - Visual accessibility analysis: 95% coverage
  - Timing accommodation verification: 90% coverage
  - Overall framework code coverage minimum: 95%

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The framework can accurately validate application compliance with WCAG standards
2. Screen reader interaction is reliably simulated to verify assistive technology compatibility
3. Keyboard navigation is thoroughly tested to ensure complete non-mouse operability
4. Visual accessibility requirements for contrast and text sizing are precisely verified
5. Time-dependent operations are tested for appropriate accommodations

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up your development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
