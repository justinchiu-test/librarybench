# Statistical Testing Framework for ML/Data Science

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for data scientists who develop machine learning models and need to verify both code implementation and statistical properties of model outputs. The framework provides statistical assertions, data validation capabilities, model performance regression detection, stochastic test handling, and resource management for computationally expensive validations.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen develops machine learning models and needs to verify both the code implementation and the statistical properties of model outputs. She requires specialized testing approaches for data pipelines and predictive algorithms.

## Key Requirements
1. **Statistical assertion library**: Create an assertion framework for validating distributional properties of model outputs. This is critical for Dr. Chen because machine learning models must produce outputs that follow expected statistical patterns, and traditional equality-based assertions are inadequate for validating probabilistic outcomes.

2. **Data validation frameworks**: Implement robust validation systems ensuring pipeline inputs and outputs meet quality criteria. This feature is essential because data quality issues are a primary source of model failure, so automatically detecting data anomalies, format issues, and distribution shifts is vital for reliable model performance.

3. **Model performance regression detection**: Develop a mechanism to identify unexpected changes in model accuracy or other performance metrics. This capability is vital because machine learning models can experience subtle degradation due to code changes, data shifts, or environmental factors, and automatically detecting these regressions helps maintain model quality.

4. **Stochastic test handling**: Build a testing framework that accommodates intentional randomness in algorithms. This feature is crucial because many machine learning algorithms contain stochastic elements (like random initialization or sampling), and tests must distinguish between expected randomness and actual errors.

5. **Resource-intensive test management**: Implement a system for efficient execution of computationally expensive model validations. This is important because model training and evaluation can require significant computational resources, and intelligent management of these resources ensures thorough testing while minimizing infrastructure costs and execution time.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Support for distributional assertions with configurable tolerance
  - Reproducible random state management
  - Test stability in the presence of stochastic processes
  - Memory-efficient handling of large datasets
  - Support for comparing model outputs across versions

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Efficient execution of resource-intensive tests
  - Statistical tests should complete in under 10 seconds for typical datasets
  - Support for selective test execution based on resource availability
  - Caching of intermediate results to avoid redundant computation
  - Graceful degradation when resource limits are reached

- **Integration Points**:
  - Common data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy)
  - Machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Data versioning systems
  - Experiment tracking platforms
  - Compute resource managers

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No UI/UX components, all functionality exposed as Python APIs
  - Minimal impact on memory footprint during test execution
  - Framework must handle both small unit tests and large integration tests
  - Support for both CPU and GPU-based model testing
  - Must accommodate both deterministic and non-deterministic testing approaches

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The framework must implement these core capabilities:

1. **Statistical Testing Engine**:
   - Distribution comparison tools (KS test, chi-squared, etc.)
   - Parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests
   - Confidence interval calculations
   - Tolerance-based assertions for numerical values
   - Statistical power analysis

2. **Data Quality Validation**:
   - Schema enforcement and validation
   - Data distribution monitoring
   - Missing value detection and handling
   - Outlier identification
   - Format and type verification

3. **Performance Regression Analysis**:
   - Metric history tracking
   - Statistical significance testing for performance changes
   - Multi-metric evaluation
   - Model comparison utilities
   - Threshold-based alerting

4. **Stochastic Test Framework**:
   - Random seed management
   - Multiple run aggregation
   - Variance analysis
   - Confidence-based assertions
   - Monte Carlo test methods

5. **Resource Management System**:
   - Test categorization by resource requirements
   - Selective test execution based on available resources
   - Computation sharing across similar tests
   - Result memoization
   - Distributed execution capabilities

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive tests that verify:

- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Statistical assertions correctly identify distribution differences
  - Data validation properly detects quality issues in diverse datasets
  - Performance regression detection accurately flags significant model degradation
  - Stochastic tests produce reliable results despite randomness
  - Resource management correctly prioritizes and schedules intensive tests

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Data scientist validates statistical properties of model outputs against expectations
  - Data pipeline tests automatically detect and report data quality issues
  - Model changes are evaluated for performance impact with clear regression signals
  - Tests involving random processes produce consistent pass/fail results
  - Computationally expensive tests are efficiently managed based on available resources

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Statistical tests process datasets with 1M+ records in under a minute
  - Data validation handles typical ETL pipeline data volumes with <5% overhead
  - Performance regression detection completes in under 10 seconds for standard models
  - Stochastic test consistency reaches >99% agreement across multiple runs
  - Resource management reduces end-to-end test time by at least 40% compared to naive execution

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Proper handling of sparse or imbalanced datasets
  - Graceful management of out-of-memory conditions with large models
  - Appropriate behavior when model outputs are non-numeric or highly skewed
  - Recovery from failed model inference or training
  - Sensible defaults when historical performance data is unavailable

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of statistical assertion functions
  - 100% coverage of data validation rules
  - 100% coverage of performance comparison logic
  - 100% coverage of random state management code
  - 100% coverage of resource allocation algorithms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

1. Statistical assertions correctly identify distribution differences with at least 95% accuracy
2. Data validation detects at least 90% of common data quality issues in standard datasets
