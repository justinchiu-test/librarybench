# Machine Learning Model Testing Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for data scientists who develop machine learning models and need to verify both code implementation and statistical properties of model outputs. This framework provides specialized testing capabilities for data pipelines, predictive algorithms, and statistical validation.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen develops machine learning models and needs to verify both the code implementation and the statistical properties of model outputs. She requires specialized testing approaches for data pipelines and predictive algorithms.

## Key Requirements
1. **Statistical assertion library validating distributional properties of model outputs**
   - Critical for ensuring model predictions conform to expected statistical distributions
   - Enables detection of drift in model behavior that might not be captured by simple accuracy metrics
   - Provides confidence intervals and statistical significance tests for model evaluation

2. **Data validation frameworks ensuring pipeline inputs and outputs meet quality criteria**
   - Prevents training on or generating predictions from corrupted or inappropriate data
   - Enforces schema requirements, range constraints, and relationship invariants
   - Catches data quality issues early in the pipeline before they affect model training or inference

3. **Model performance regression detection identifying unexpected accuracy changes**
   - Alerts when model performance degrades unexpectedly after code or data changes
   - Provides statistical confidence levels for performance differences
   - Helps distinguish between normal variance and actual performance regressions

4. **Stochastic test handling accommodating intentional randomness in algorithms**
   - Properly manages non-deterministic components in machine learning algorithms
   - Provides seed management and statistical approaches for testing random processes
   - Balances the need for reproducibility with the reality of stochastic algorithms

5. **Resource-intensive test management for computationally expensive model validation**
   - Optimizes execution of computation-heavy tests to minimize time and resource usage
   - Provides intelligent sampling strategies for comprehensive validation with limited resources
   - Manages test execution to avoid overwhelming available computational resources

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Framework must support statistical hypothesis testing with configurable significance levels
  - Tests must accommodate both deterministic and stochastic model components
  - Framework must support testing with both real and synthetic datasets
  - Tests must be executable on various compute platforms (CPU, GPU, distributed)

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Statistical validation must scale to datasets with millions of samples
  - Resource-intensive tests should utilize intelligent sampling to complete in reasonable time
  - Framework overhead should be negligible compared to actual model computation time
  - Test initialization must not significantly impact rapid iteration during model development

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must integrate with common data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Should provide hooks for model registry and experiment tracking systems
  - Must support standard data formats and storage systems
  - Should integrate with distributed computing frameworks for large-scale tests

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Tests must be executable in both local development and production environments
  - Implementation must handle large datasets without excessive memory requirements
  - Framework must accommodate models with varying levels of determinism
  - Solution should not require changes to the core modeling code

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Power analysis for test result reliability
   - Multiple comparison correction methods

2. **Data Quality Validation**
   - Schema enforcement and validation
   - Statistical property verification
   - Anomaly and outlier detection
   - Data integrity and consistency checks

3. **Model Performance Analysis**
   - Metric calculation and comparison across model versions
   - Performance degradation detection with statistical significance
   - Sensitivity analysis for feature importance stability
   - Cross-validation result consistency verification

4. **Stochastic Test Management**
   - Seed management for reproducibility
   - Statistical sampling for stochastic process validation

5. **Computational Resource Optimization**
   - Test partitioning and prioritization
   - Incremental testing based on model and data changes

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified**:
  - Accuracy of statistical assertion library for various distributions
  - Reliability of data validation for different data types and schemas
  - Precision of model performance regression detection
  - Effectiveness of stochastic test handling with varying levels of randomness
  - Efficiency of resource management for computationally intensive tests

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Data scientist validating a new model against statistical expectations
  - Detecting data quality issues in preprocessing pipelines
  - Identifying performance regressions after model or data changes
  - Testing models with inherent randomness like ensemble methods or neural networks
  - Running comprehensive validation tests with limited computational resources

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Statistical tests must complete in < 30 seconds for datasets up to 1GB
  - Data validation must process at least 100MB/second on standard hardware
  - Performance regression analysis must detect changes of >= 1% with 95% confidence
  - Resource optimization should reduce test time by at least 50% compared to naive execution

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling extremely imbalanced or skewed data distributions
  - Managing tests for models with high variance in performance
  - Appropriate behavior when statistical tests are inconclusive
  - Graceful degradation when computational resources are constrained
  - Correct operation with missing or partially available training data

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Statistical testing components: 100% coverage
  - Data validation routines: 95% coverage
  - Performance regression detection: 90% coverage
  - Stochastic test handling: 90% coverage
  - Resource optimization: 85% coverage
  - Overall framework code coverage minimum: 90%

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The framework can accurately validate statistical properties of model outputs with appropriate confidence levels
2. Data quality can be comprehensively verified throughout the machine learning pipeline
3. Model performance regressions are detected with statistical rigor
4. Stochastic models can be effectively tested despite inherent randomness
5. Computationally expensive tests are managed efficiently to balance thoroughness with resource constraints

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up your development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file MUST be generated and included as it is a critical requirement for project completion and verification.
