# Non-Invasive Testing Framework for Legacy Systems

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for engineers maintaining critical legacy applications, providing capabilities to introduce automated testing with minimal changes to existing codebases. This framework focuses on non-invasive instrumentation, characterization testing, and seamless integration with existing manual test procedures.

## Persona Description
Eleanor maintains critical business applications built on older technology stacks. She needs to introduce automated testing to legacy systems without significant refactoring or risk to stable production code.

## Key Requirements
1. **Non-invasive test instrumentation requiring minimal changes to existing code** - Critical for Eleanor to add testing without modifying stable legacy code, using techniques like runtime interception, binary instrumentation, and external observation to verify behavior without altering the original codebase.

2. **Hybrid testing combining modern automated approaches with existing manual test procedures** - Enables a gradual transition from manual to automated testing by capturing and replicating existing manual test procedures, preserving institutional knowledge while incrementally improving test coverage and reliability.

3. **Characterization test generation automatically creating tests that document current behavior** - Essential for establishing a baseline of how the system currently functions by automatically generating tests that describe existing behavior without assuming correctness, making implicit behavior explicit before modifications begin.

4. **Technology-agnostic test interfaces supporting older languages and frameworks** - Necessary to provide test coverage for systems built with obsolete or uncommon technologies by creating adaptable interfaces that work across different technology stacks without requiring modern language features.

5. **Documentation extraction automatically generating system behavior documentation from tests** - Helps Eleanor recover and maintain system knowledge by deriving documentation from test observations, creating a living record of how the system actually behaves rather than outdated or non-existent formal documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability requirements**
  - Testing must work without requiring source code modifications when necessary
  - Framework must support interception at multiple levels (network, file I/O, UI, database)
  - Tests must be isolated from one another to avoid interference
  - Test results must be deterministic despite working with non-deterministic legacy systems
  - Framework must support a gradual transition from manual to automated testing

- **Performance expectations**
  - Instrumentation overhead should not exceed 10% of normal execution time
  - Test generation should process existing application behavior at near real-time speed
  - Documentation extraction should complete in under 5 minutes for 1000 test cases
  - System monitoring must not interfere with normal application timing behavior
  - Framework initialization should not delay application startup by more than 2 seconds

- **Integration points**
  - Diverse technology stacks including obsolete languages and platforms
  - Existing manual test procedures and scripts
  - Current monitoring and logging infrastructure
  - Documentation systems and knowledge repositories
  - Production debugging and profiling tools

- **Key constraints**
  - No UI components; all functionality exposed through APIs
  - Must not require significant refactoring of legacy code
  - Cannot introduce dependencies that might conflict with existing libraries
  - Should work with limited or outdated documentation
  - Must operate in restricted environments with security and compliance limitations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The framework needs to implement:

1. **Runtime Behavior Observer**: Systems to monitor and record application behavior through non-invasive techniques including network traffic capture, API interception, UI interaction recording, and database query observation.

2. **Characterization Test Generator**: Logic to automatically generate tests that document existing system behavior by analyzing inputs, outputs, and side effects without assuming correctness.

3. **Manual Test Procedure Translator**: Tools to capture, formalize, and automate existing manual test procedures, preserving institutional knowledge while enabling repeatability and validation.

4. **Cross-technology Adapter System**: Interfaces to bridge between the testing framework and various legacy technologies, providing consistent testing capabilities regardless of the target system's implementation details.

5. **Behavior Documentation Extractor**: Components to derive system documentation from observed behaviors and test cases, creating structured knowledge about how the system actually functions.

6. **Incremental Coverage Analyzer**: Logic to track test coverage over time and identify high-value areas for additional testing, prioritizing critical functionality and risk areas.

7. **Change Impact Predictor**: Systems to analyze proposed changes and predict their impact on existing functionality based on observed dependencies and behavior patterns.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key functionalities that must be verified**
  - Accurate non-invasive observation of application behavior
  - Correct generation of characterization tests from observed behavior
  - Reliable execution of tests across different technology stacks
  - Proper translation of manual test procedures into automated tests
  - Accurate extraction of system documentation from test observations

- **Critical user scenarios that should be tested**
  - Adding automated testing to a legacy application without source code modifications
  - Converting an existing manual test procedure into automated validation
  - Documenting undocumented system behavior through observation
  - Identifying potential impacts of proposed changes before implementation
  - Gradually improving test coverage of a legacy system over time

- **Performance benchmarks that must be met**
  - Instrumentation should add no more than 15% overhead to system under test
  - Test generation should process at least 100 observed behaviors per minute
  - Documentation extraction should handle at least 200 test cases per minute
  - Test execution should support at least 50 test cases per minute
  - System should scale to applications with up to 1 million lines of code

- **Edge cases and error conditions that must be handled properly**
  - Systems with non-deterministic or timing-dependent behavior
  - Applications with poor separation of concerns or global state
  - Undocumented external dependencies or integrations
  - Incomplete or incorrect existing documentation
  - Hostile runtime environments with limited observability

- **Required test coverage metrics**
  - Functional coverage: Tests should exercise all observable behaviors
  - Interface coverage: Tests should verify all external interfaces
  - Path coverage: Tests should exercise primary user workflows
  - State coverage: Tests should verify system behavior across different states
  - Exception coverage: Tests should verify handling of error conditions

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The framework can successfully test a legacy application without requiring source code modifications
2. Characterization tests accurately capture and describe existing system behavior
3. Manual test procedures are successfully translated into automated tests with equivalent validation
4. Testing works effectively across different technology stacks through the adapter system
5. Documentation extracted from tests provides accurate and useful information about system behavior
6. The testing process identifies potential issues in proposed changes before they're implemented
7. All functionality is accessible through well-defined APIs without requiring UI components

To set up your development environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
