# Internationalization Testing Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for localization managers who coordinate product translation and adaptation for international markets. The framework provides internationalization validation, pseudo-localization testing, cultural appropriateness checking, right-to-left language support verification, and regional format testing to ensure applications function correctly across different languages, regions, and cultural settings.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel coordinates product translation and adaptation for international markets. He needs to verify that applications function correctly across different languages, regions, and cultural settings.

## Key Requirements
1. **Internationalization validation**: Develop tools for ensuring all user-facing text is properly externalized. This is critical for Dr. Patel because hardcoded strings cannot be translated, and automated detection of non-externalized text helps identify content that would remain in the source language across all locales.

2. **Pseudo-localization testing**: Create a system for identifying potential layout and display issues before translation. This feature is essential because many visual and functional problems only become apparent when text length changes or special characters are introduced, and early detection prevents costly fixes after translation.

3. **Cultural appropriateness checking**: Implement validation for colors, symbols, and imagery across markets. This capability is vital because cultural meanings vary globally, and automated screening helps identify potentially offensive or inappropriate elements before they cause market-specific issues.

4. **Right-to-left language support verification**: Build testing tools for bidirectional text handling. This feature is crucial because languages like Arabic and Hebrew read right-to-left and require special layout considerations, and these tests ensure that the application correctly handles this fundamental directional change.

5. **Regional format testing**: Develop validation ensuring dates, numbers, and currencies display correctly by locale. This is important because format expectations vary significantly by region (date ordering, decimal separators, currency symbols), and these tests verify that the application adapts these elements appropriately for each target market.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Support for multiple languages and locales
  - Ability to simulate translation effects
  - Cultural context awareness
  - Bidirectional text testing capabilities
  - Regional format simulation

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Internationalization validation complete in under 10 minutes for typical applications
  - Pseudo-localization transformation apply in real-time during testing
  - Cultural appropriateness checks process visual assets efficiently
  - RTL testing with minimal configuration overhead
  - Regional format validation across dozens of locales within reasonable timeframes

- **Integration Points**:
  - Translation management systems
  - Resource bundle handling
  - String externalization frameworks
  - Regional formatting libraries
  - Cultural databases and references

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No UI/UX components, all functionality exposed as Python APIs
  - Support for all major language families and writing systems
  - Minimal false positives in internationalization issues
  - Must accommodate various resource formats (.properties, .resx, .po, etc.)
  - Support for both code and content analysis

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The framework must implement these core capabilities:

1. **String Externalization Analysis**:
   - Resource file completeness checking
   - Hardcoded string detection
   - Key consistency verification
   - Translation coverage assessment
   - String context preservation

2. **Pseudo-localization Engine**:
   - Text expansion simulation
   - Special character introduction
   - Bidirectional text emulation
   - Boundary testing for UI elements
   - Concatenation and interpolation detection

3. **Cultural Validation System**:
   - Color meaning analysis
   - Symbol appropriateness checking
   - Gesture and imagery validation
   - Numeric and date significance validation
   - Terminology appropriateness verification

4. **Bidirectional Text Framework**:
   - Layout direction verification
   - Text alignment validation
   - Mirroring assessment for UI elements
   - Mixed directional text handling
   - Directional override validation

5. **Regional Format Testing Engine**:
   - Date format validation
   - Number formatting verification
   - Currency representation testing
   - Address format checking
   - Unit conversion validation

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive tests that verify:

- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Internationalization validation correctly identifies non-externalized strings
  - Pseudo-localization testing accurately reveals UI issues before translation
  - Cultural appropriateness checking identifies potentially problematic elements
  - RTL language support testing verifies proper bidirectional text handling
  - Regional format testing confirms correct locale-specific formatting

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Localization manager verifies complete string externalization before translation
  - UI layout issues are detected through pseudo-localization before translation begins
  - Application elements are screened for cultural appropriateness across target markets
  - Right-to-left language support is validated for proper text and layout handling
  - Date, number, and currency formats are verified across multiple regional settings

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Internationalization validation processes 10,000+ strings in under 5 minutes
  - Pseudo-localization transforms application text in real-time during testing
  - Cultural appropriateness checking evaluates 1,000+ visual elements in under 10 minutes
  - RTL testing completes full application validation in under 15 minutes
  - Regional format testing verifies formatting across 50+ locales in under 5 minutes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of mixed language content
  - Proper analysis of dynamic text generation
  - Appropriate behavior with unusual or rare languages
  - Graceful handling of incomplete locale information
  - Recovery from malformed resource files

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of string externalization detection logic
  - 100% coverage of pseudo-localization transformation rules
  - 100% coverage of cultural validation rules
  - 100% coverage of RTL handling requirements
  - 100% coverage of regional format specifications

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Internationalization validation detects at least 95% of non-externalized strings
2. Pseudo-localization testing identifies at least 90% of potential layout issues
3. Cultural appropriateness checking flags at least 85% of culturally problematic elements
4. RTL language testing verifies proper bidirectional text handling with at least 95% accuracy
5. Regional format testing correctly validates formatting for at least 50 different locales
6. The framework can test applications built with at least 3 different technology stacks

8. Localization testing completes in less than 20% of the time required for manual assessment
9. All functionality is accessible programmatically through well-defined Python APIs
10. The framework can be integrated into development workflows for continuous internationalization verification
