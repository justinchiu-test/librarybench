# Security Testing Automation Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for security engineers who test applications for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security best practices. This framework provides security-focused testing capabilities for identifying potential security issues during the development process.

## Persona Description
Sophia tests applications for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security best practices. She needs testing tools that can identify potential security issues during the development process.

## Key Requirements
1. **Security assertion library with specialized checks for common vulnerability patterns**
   - Critical for systematically testing for known security weaknesses (OWASP Top 10, CWE, etc.)
   - Provides consistent verification of security controls and mitigations
   - Enables security testing without extensive security expertise for each test case

2. **API abuse testing automatically probing endpoints for security weaknesses**
   - Identifies vulnerabilities by simulating malicious API interactions
   - Tests boundary conditions and unexpected inputs that might expose security flaws
   - Verifies proper validation, authorization, and error handling under attack conditions

3. **Sensitive data leakage detection identifying exposed credentials or personal information**
   - Prevents accidental exposure of secrets, credentials, PII, and other sensitive data
   - Ensures that sensitive information isn't logged, cached, or transmitted insecurely
   - Validates data masking and protection mechanisms throughout the application

4. **Authentication flow validation ensuring proper implementation of security controls**
   - Verifies that authentication mechanisms follow security best practices
   - Tests for common authentication vulnerabilities (credential stuffing, brute force)
   - Ensures proper session management and access control after authentication

5. **Compliance validation checking alignment with security standards (OWASP, NIST, etc.)**
   - Measures adherence to industry-standard security frameworks and guidelines
   - Generates evidence of security control implementation for compliance reviews
   - Provides structured reporting mapped to specific security requirements

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Framework must support injection of malicious test payloads safely
  - Tests must verify proper implementation of security controls without triggering false positives
  - Framework must simulate sophisticated attack patterns
  - Tests must be executable in isolation to prevent security test side effects

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Security assertion checks must complete within 10ms per assertion
  - API abuse testing should test 100+ attack vectors per endpoint in < 5 minutes
  - Data leakage detection must scan 1GB of data in < 2 minutes
  - Authentication flow validation must complete all scenarios in < 1 minute

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must integrate with common security testing tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite)
  - Should work with standard vulnerability databases (CVE, CWE)
  - Must support export to security compliance reporting formats
  - Should integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Security tests must never create actual security incidents or data breaches
  - Implementation must not store sensitive test data in logs or reports
  - Framework must never deploy exploits that could damage production systems
  - Solution should minimize false positives while maintaining high detection rates

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this test automation framework includes:

1. **Security Assertion System**
   - Vulnerability pattern detection and verification
   - Security control implementation testing
   - Secure coding practice validation
   - Defense-in-depth verification

2. **API Security Testing Engine**
   - Automated attack vector generation and execution
   - Input validation and sanitization testing
   - Error handling and information disclosure analysis
   - Access control boundary testing

3. **Sensitive Data Scanner**
   - Pattern-based sensitive data detection
   - Data flow analysis for information leakage
   - Encryption and masking verification
   - Secret and credential exposure testing

4. **Authentication Security Validator**
   - Authentication mechanism security analysis
   - Multi-factor authentication verification
   - Session management security testing
   - Credential handling and storage validation

5. **Security Compliance Framework**
   - Security standard mapping and verification
   - Control implementation evidence collection
   - Gap analysis against security requirements
   - Compliance reporting and documentation

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified**:
  - Accuracy of security assertion library for detecting vulnerabilities
  - Effectiveness of API abuse testing in identifying security weaknesses
  - Precision of sensitive data leakage detection
  - Thoroughness of authentication flow validation
  - Completeness of compliance validation against security standards

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Security engineer testing an application for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
  - Probing API endpoints for security weaknesses and improper validation
  - Scanning application data flows for sensitive information leakage
  - Validating authentication, session management, and access control
  - Generating compliance reports for security standards and frameworks

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Security assertions must achieve 95%+ detection rate for known vulnerabilities
  - API abuse testing must execute 1000+ attack vectors in < 10 minutes
  - Data leakage detection must achieve 99%+ accuracy for known sensitive data patterns
  - Compliance validation must verify 100+ security controls in < 5 minutes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling deliberately obfuscated or encoded security vulnerabilities
  - Testing applications with custom or non-standard security mechanisms
  - Appropriate behavior when encountering novel attack vectors
  - Correct operation with encrypted or protected communications
  - Avoiding false positives in highly dynamic application environments

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Security assertion library: 100% coverage
  - API abuse testing engine: 95% coverage
  - Sensitive data detection: 100% coverage
  - Authentication validation: 100% coverage
  - Compliance framework: 95% coverage
  - Overall framework code coverage minimum: 95%

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The security assertion library can detect common vulnerability patterns with high accuracy
2. API abuse testing effectively identifies security weaknesses in application endpoints
3. Sensitive data leakage is reliably detected throughout the application
4. Authentication flows are thoroughly validated for security best practices
5. Compliance with security standards can be verified and documented

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up your development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file MUST be generated and included as it is a critical requirement for project completion and verification.
