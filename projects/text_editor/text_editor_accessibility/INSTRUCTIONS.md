# Accessible Text Editor Library for Vision-Impaired Developers

## Overview
A fully accessible text editing library designed specifically for developers with visual impairments. This implementation focuses on screen reader optimization, audio feedback, semantic navigation, customizable presentation, and keyboard-only workflows to create a powerful development environment that doesn't rely on visual interfaces.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen has limited vision and uses screen readers and other assistive technologies. She needs a text editor with excellent accessibility that works well with screen readers while still providing powerful editing capabilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Screen Reader Optimization**
   - Implement context-aware document structure announcements that convey code hierarchy and organization
   - Critical for Dr. Chen as it provides semantic understanding of code structure beyond just reading text sequentially
   - Must intelligently announce programming constructs (functions, classes, loops) with appropriate context and nesting level

2. **Audio Feedback for Operations**
   - Develop a comprehensive non-visual feedback system using distinctive sounds for different editing actions
   - Essential for providing immediate confirmation of operations without requiring visual verification
   - Must create an intuitive audio language that conveys operation success, failure, and impact through sound patterns

3. **Semantic Document Navigation**
   - Create a navigation system based on code structure rather than visual layout
   - Crucial for efficiently traversing code by jumping between functions, classes, loops, and other structural elements
   - Must provide intelligent navigation commands that understand programming language syntax and structure

4. **Customizable High-Contrast Themes**
   - Implement advanced color and presentation management with accessibility focus
   - Allows personalization for developers with different types of visual impairments to maximize remaining vision
   - Must support various color blindness profiles, contrast ratios, and font characteristics

5. **Keyboard-Only Workflow**
   - Design a complete workflow that eliminates any need for mouse positioning
   - Ensures all editing operations are accessible through keyboard shortcuts and commands
   - Must include discovery mechanisms and consistent patterns for keyboard operation across all functions

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Screen reader output must be capturable and verifiable for correctness
- Audio feedback must be testable for appropriate sound generation
- Navigation operations must be verifiable against document structure
- Theme customization must be testable for contrast ratios and accessibility standards
- Keyboard workflow must be completely testable without mouse or visual inputs

### Performance Expectations
- Screen reader content generation must occur in under 50ms
- Audio feedback must be immediate (<10ms delay) for operation confirmation
- Semantic navigation must complete within 100ms even in large codebases
- Theme switching and customization must apply within 200ms
- All keyboard operations must be responsive (<50ms latency)

### Integration Points
- Screen reader technologies and accessibility APIs
- Audio system for feedback generation
- Programming language parsers for semantic understanding
- Color management systems with accessibility standards
- Keyboard input handling and shortcut management

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be accessible programmatically with no UI dependencies
- The system must work with standard screen reader technologies
- Operations must be completely accessible without visual feedback
- All features must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AAA standards
- The architecture must separate content, structure, and presentation concerns

## Core Functionality

The implementation should provide a comprehensive accessible text editing library with:

1. **Accessible Document Model**
   - Semantic representation of document structure
   - Programming language-aware parsing
   - Hierarchical organization of content
   - Metadata for accessibility annotations

2. **Screen Reader Integration System**
   - Context-aware content announcements
   - Structural information conveying
   - Customizable verbosity levels
   - Language-specific pronunciation rules

3. **Audio Feedback Framework**
   - Sound pattern design for different operations
   - Spatial audio for positional feedback
   - Volume and tone customization
   - Pattern recognition for operation grouping

4. **Semantic Navigation Engine**
   - Structure-based movement operations
   - Language-specific navigation rules
   - Intelligent landmark identification
   - Search and filtering by code constructs

5. **Accessibility Presentation System**
   - High-contrast theme management
   - Font characteristic customization
   - Color blindness compensation
   - Layout optimization for screen readers

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate screen reader announcements for different code structures
- Appropriate audio feedback for all editing operations
- Efficient navigation through document based on semantic structure
- Compliance with accessibility standards for visual presentation
- Complete operability through keyboard-only commands

### Critical User Scenarios
- Navigating and understanding a complex codebase
- Editing code with immediate non-visual feedback
- Searching for specific code constructs by type
- Customizing presentation for specific visual impairment profiles
- Performing complex refactoring operations without visual guidance

### Performance Benchmarks
- Screen reader context generation must complete in <50ms for any document section
- Audio feedback must trigger within 10ms of the associated action
- Semantic navigation must process files at >10,000 lines per second
- Theme customization must maintain at least 7:1 contrast ratio for critical elements
- All keyboard operations must complete end-to-end in <100ms

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely large source files (>100,000 lines)
- Malformed or syntactically incorrect code
- Conflicting keyboard shortcut configurations
- Integration with different screen reader technologies
- Recovery from interrupted operations

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >95% code coverage for screen reader integration
- >90% coverage for audio feedback system
- >95% coverage for semantic navigation
- >90% coverage for theme customization
- >95% overall project coverage

## Success Criteria
- Screen reader announcements provide complete understanding of code structure
- Audio feedback creates an intuitive "sound language" for editing operations
- Navigation efficiency meets or exceeds that of visual navigation for experienced users
- Visual presentation accommodates a wide range of vision impairments
- All operations are accessible and efficient through keyboard-only workflows
- Dr. Chen can work with the same productivity as developers using visual editors

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed to integrate with existing screen readers and accessibility technologies.
