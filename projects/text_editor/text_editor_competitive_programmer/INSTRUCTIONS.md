# Competitive Programming Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editor library designed for competitive programmers, focusing on rapid code generation, testing, and optimization. This implementation prioritizes efficiency with templates, test case validation, timing-aware features, algorithm libraries, and keystroke optimization to maximize performance in time-constrained programming competitions.

## Persona Description
Miguel participates in programming competitions where editing speed directly impacts performance. He needs extremely efficient text manipulation with minimal keystrokes and specialized features for algorithmic problem-solving.

## Key Requirements
1. **Code Template System**: Implement a sophisticated template management system with parameterized snippets for common algorithmic patterns (graph algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.). This is critical for Miguel to quickly scaffold solutions during competitions where starting from a proven template can save precious minutes compared to writing from scratch.

2. **Test Case Runner and Validator**: Create a framework for defining, running, and validating test cases against solution code. This allows Miguel to quickly verify his solutions against sample inputs/outputs and custom test cases without leaving the editor, saving time during competitions where rapid iteration is essential.

3. **Competition Timer Integration**: Develop a timing system that tracks remaining competition time, problem-specific time investments, and estimated completion timelines. This helps Miguel manage his time effectively during competitions where strategic time allocation between problems can significantly impact overall performance.

4. **Algorithm Library with Search**: Build a searchable reference library of common competitive programming algorithms and data structures with complexity analysis. This enables Miguel to quickly lookup and adapt optimal solutions for standard algorithmic problems, which is crucial when facing familiar problem patterns under time pressure.

5. **Keystroke Efficiency Analyzer**: Create a system that monitors common editing patterns and suggests shorter command sequences or templates to improve efficiency. This addresses Miguel's need to continually optimize his coding speed, as even small efficiency improvements can compound into significant time savings across a competition.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Template instantiation must be testable with various parameter combinations
  - Test case validation must provide consistent results for identical inputs
  - Timer functionality must be testable with simulated competition scenarios
  - Algorithm search must be testable for accuracy and relevance of results
  - Keystroke efficiency suggestions must be measurable for improvement potential

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Template instantiation should complete in under 100ms
  - Test case execution should be bounded by user-defined time limits
  - All operations should prioritize responsiveness over completeness when approaching time limits
  - Search operations should return results in under 200ms
  - The system should startup in under 1 second to not waste competition time

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for multiple programming languages common in competitions
  - Integration with standard input/output for test case processing
  - Support for importing/exporting templates and algorithm libraries
  - Integration with execution environments for different languages
  - Compatibility with common competitive programming platforms' time limits

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must operate with minimal resource usage to leave processing power for solution execution
  - Must support extremely rapid text manipulations without latency
  - Must handle code templates for multiple languages with correct syntax
  - All features must be accessible without requiring mouse interaction
  - Must scale to accommodate large algorithm libraries without performance degradation

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Template Management System**: Components for defining, storing, retrieving, and instantiating code templates with parameter substitution.

2. **Code Execution Engine**: A system for running code against test cases and validating outputs.

3. **Competition Timer**: Mechanisms for tracking time constraints and usage patterns.

4. **Algorithm Reference Library**: A structured, searchable database of algorithms with metadata.

5. **Editing Pattern Analysis**: Tools for monitoring edit operations and suggesting optimizations.

6. **Language-Specific Support**: Handlers for syntax and execution requirements of different programming languages.

The library should use efficient data structures for rapid text manipulation and prioritize keyboard-driven operations. It should provide programmatic interfaces for all functions without requiring a graphical interface, allowing it to be used in various competition environments or integrated with preferred editors.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of template instantiation with various parameters
  - Correctness of test case validation across different languages
  - Precision of timing functionality under various constraints
  - Relevance and accuracy of algorithm library search results
  - Effectiveness of keystroke efficiency suggestions

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Solving time-constrained algorithmic problems from start to submission
  - Rapidly iterating through test cases to debug edge cases
  - Searching for and adapting algorithm implementations under pressure
  - Managing multiple competition problems with different time allocations
  - Improving coding speed through template usage and keystroke optimization

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Template system should handle at least 100 templates with retrieval in under 200ms
  - Test case execution should support at least 20 cases per second for simple problems
  - Algorithm search should return relevant results in under 300ms
  - Text operations should complete in under 50ms even for large files
  - Memory usage should remain under 200MB even with large algorithm libraries loaded

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling malformed templates or invalid parameters
  - Recovering from infinite loops or excessive resource usage in test execution
  - Dealing with ambiguous search queries in the algorithm library
  - Managing concurrent operations during intense coding sessions
  - Handling very large input/output test cases

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 95% line coverage for template management functionality
  - 90% coverage for test case execution and validation
  - 90% coverage for timing and competition management features
  - 85% coverage for algorithm library and search functions
  - 90% coverage for keystroke efficiency analysis

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Competitive programmers can significantly reduce solution development time using the template system.

2. Test case validation accurately identifies correct and incorrect solutions.

3. Time management features help optimize problem-solving strategy during competitions.

4. Algorithm library provides relevant, easily adaptable implementations for common problems.

5. Keystroke efficiency analysis leads to measurable improvements in coding speed.

6. The system remains responsive and low-overhead even during intense coding sessions.

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the implementation for competitive programming scenarios.
