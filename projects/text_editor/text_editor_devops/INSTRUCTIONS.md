# Infrastructure Code Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editor library designed for DevOps engineers, focusing on infrastructure-as-code validation, environment-aware configuration, security scanning, infrastructure drift detection, and visualization of infrastructure components. This implementation prioritizes the specific challenges of managing cloud resources through code.

## Persona Description
Sophia writes and maintains infrastructure-as-code across multiple cloud platforms. She needs specialized editing features for YAML, Terraform, and other configuration formats with awareness of deployment contexts.

## Key Requirements
1. **Cloud Resource Validation Engine**: Implement a system that validates infrastructure code against provider-specific schemas (AWS, Azure, GCP) and best practices. This is critical for Sophia to catch misconfigurations before deployment, preventing costly errors and potential outages in production environments.

2. **Environment Variable Contextualization**: Create a framework that shows different renderings of configuration files based on environment variables and deployment targets. This helps Sophia understand how configuration will be processed in different environments (dev, staging, production), preventing environment-specific bugs.

3. **Secret Detection and Management**: Develop a scanning system that identifies potential secrets, credentials, and sensitive information in infrastructure code. This addresses Sophia's need to prevent accidental exposure of credentials in version control, which could lead to security breaches.

4. **Infrastructure Drift Detection**: Build functionality to compare infrastructure code with actual deployed resources, identifying discrepancies. This allows Sophia to detect when manual changes have been made to infrastructure outside the code pipeline, ensuring infrastructure remains consistent with its definition.

5. **Infrastructure Visualization Generator**: Implement a system that renders visual representations of infrastructure components and relationships from code (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.). This enables Sophia to better understand complex infrastructure designs and communicate them with stakeholders who may not be familiar with the code syntax.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Resource validation must be testable against sample configuration files
  - Environment variable rendering must be testable with different variable sets
  - Secret detection must identify known patterns without false negatives
  - Drift detection must correctly identify differences between code and mock resources
  - Visualization output must be verifiable for accuracy and completeness

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Validation should complete within 3 seconds for complex infrastructure definitions
  - Environment rendering should update within 500ms when variables change
  - Secret scanning should process at least 1MB of code per second
  - Drift detection should scale linearly with infrastructure size
  - Visualization generation should complete within 5 seconds for typical infrastructure

- **Integration Points**:
  - Integration with cloud provider APIs for validation and drift detection
  - Support for standard environment variable conventions and substitution syntax
  - Compatibility with secret scanning tools and practices
  - Integration with infrastructure state representations (Terraform state, etc.)
  - Support for generating standardized infrastructure diagrams

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must support multiple infrastructure definition formats (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes YAML, etc.)
  - Must handle large infrastructure definitions with thousands of resources
  - Must never transmit sensitive information during validation or visualization
  - Must respect rate limits when interacting with cloud provider APIs
  - Must provide useful validation without requiring actual cloud access

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Infrastructure Code Parsing**: Components for parsing and understanding various infrastructure definition formats.

2. **Schema Validation**: A system for validating configurations against provider-specific schemas and best practices.

3. **Variable Substitution**: Tools for applying environment variables and context-specific values to configurations.

4. **Secret Detection**: Pattern-based and heuristic scanning for potential secrets and sensitive information.

5. **State Comparison**: Mechanisms for comparing code definitions with actual infrastructure state.

6. **Diagram Generation**: Tools for creating visual representations of infrastructure components and relationships.

7. **Provider Integration**: Interfaces for interacting with cloud provider APIs for validation and state information.

The library should use efficient parsing strategies optimized for infrastructure code formats. It should provide programmatic interfaces for all functions without requiring a graphical interface, allowing it to be integrated with various editors or used in CI/CD pipelines.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of validation against provider schemas
  - Correctness of variable substitution across different contexts
  - Effectiveness of secret detection for various credential formats
  - Precision of drift detection between code and simulated states
  - Accuracy of visualization generation from infrastructure code

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Validating complex multi-provider infrastructure definitions
  - Understanding how configuration will render in different environments
  - Identifying accidentally committed secrets before they reach repositories
  - Detecting and reconciling drift between code and deployed resources
  - Generating diagrams to communicate infrastructure design

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Validation should process at least 100 resources per second
  - Variable substitution should handle at least 1000 variables across a configuration
  - Secret scanning should have less than 5% false positives on standard code
  - Drift detection should process state comparison at a rate of 50 resources per second
  - Visualization should scale to handle infrastructures with up to 500 connected components

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling invalid or incomplete infrastructure definitions
  - Providing useful feedback when validation fails
  - Dealing with circular dependencies in infrastructure components
  - Managing very large infrastructure definitions (10,000+ resources)
  - Handling cloud provider API failures gracefully

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90% line coverage for parsing and validation logic
  - 95% coverage for secret detection algorithms
  - 90% coverage for drift detection comparison
  - 85% coverage for visualization generation
  - 95% coverage for environment variable substitution

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Infrastructure code validation catches common misconfigurations and errors before deployment.

2. Environment variable substitution accurately shows how configurations will render in different contexts.

3. Secret detection identifies credentials and sensitive information with high accuracy and low false positives.

4. Drift detection correctly identifies differences between infrastructure code and simulated deployed resources.

5. Visualization generation creates accurate and understandable representations of infrastructure components.

6. Performance remains responsive even with large, complex infrastructure definitions.

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the implementation for DevOps workflows.

To set up the virtual environment, use `uv venv` from within the project directory. The environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
