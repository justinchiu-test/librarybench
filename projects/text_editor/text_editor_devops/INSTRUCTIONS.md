# Infrastructure-as-Code Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editing library designed for DevOps engineers working with infrastructure-as-code. This implementation focuses on cloud resource validation, environment-aware configuration, security compliance, infrastructure drift detection, and visualization capabilities to ensure reliable and secure infrastructure deployments.

## Persona Description
Sophia writes and maintains infrastructure-as-code across multiple cloud platforms. She needs specialized editing features for YAML, Terraform, and other configuration formats with awareness of deployment contexts.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Resource Validation**
   - Implement schema validation for various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and IaC tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
   - Critical for Sophia as it prevents deployment failures by catching syntax and logical errors before applying changes
   - Must validate against provider-specific constraints and best practices to ensure deployments will succeed

2. **Environment Variable Awareness**
   - Develop a system that shows different renderings of configuration files based on deployment targets
   - Essential for maintaining consistent configurations across development, staging, and production environments
   - Must resolve variable substitutions and show the actual values that would be used in different deployment contexts

3. **Secret Detection**
   - Create sophisticated pattern matching for identifying secrets, credentials, and sensitive data in configuration files
   - Crucial for preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information in version control or logs
   - Must detect various types of secrets (API keys, passwords, certificates) with low false positive/negative rates

4. **Infrastructure Drift Detection**
   - Build functionality to compare configuration files with actual deployed resources
   - Allows identification of manual changes or unauthorized modifications to cloud infrastructure
   - Must connect to cloud provider APIs to retrieve current state and highlight differences from defined configurations

5. **Infrastructure Visualization**
   - Implement a system to generate graphical representations of infrastructure defined in code
   - Provides intuitive understanding of complex infrastructure relationships and dependencies
   - Must translate various IaC formats into consistent visual representations showing resource relationships

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Cloud resource validation must be testable with sample configuration files
- Environment variable rendering must be verifiable with different variable sets
- Secret detection must be testable against known patterns and edge cases
- Drift detection must be testable with mocked cloud provider responses
- Visualization output must be verifiable for correctness against defined infrastructure

### Performance Expectations
- Schema validation should complete in under 500ms for typical configuration files
- Environment rendering should process variables in under 100ms 
- Secret detection should scan at a rate of at least 1MB per second
- Drift detection should complete within 5 seconds for deployments with up to 100 resources
- Visualization generation should complete in under 2 seconds for typical infrastructure definitions

### Integration Points
- Cloud provider APIs for resource validation and drift detection
- IaC tool schemas (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Secret detection patterns and databases
- Environment variable management systems
- Graph visualization libraries and formats

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be accessible programmatically with no UI dependencies
- Cloud provider integrations must use secure authentication methods
- The system must not store or transmit sensitive information
- Visualization outputs must be in standard formats (SVG, PNG, or JSON)
- Operations should work offline when possible, with clear dependencies on cloud connectivity

## Core Functionality

The implementation should provide a comprehensive infrastructure-as-code editing library with:

1. **Multi-Provider Schema Validation System**
   - Provider-specific schema repositories
   - Syntax and semantic validation
   - Best practice enforcement
   - Cross-resource dependency validation

2. **Environment Context Engine**
   - Variable resolution across environments
   - Conditional resource rendering
   - Environment-specific validation rules
   - Differential environment comparison

3. **Security Compliance Framework**
   - Secret and credential detection
   - Compliance policy enforcement
   - Security best practice validation
   - Automated remediation suggestions

4. **Infrastructure State Management**
   - Cloud provider API integration
   - State difference calculation
   - Drift notification and reporting
   - Remediation planning

5. **Resource Visualization System**
   - Resource dependency graphing
   - Multi-format parser adapters
   - Visual output generation
   - Interactive data structures for exploration

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate validation of cloud resource configurations
- Correct rendering of configurations with different environment variables
- Reliable detection of secrets and sensitive information
- Precise identification of infrastructure drift
- Accurate visualization of resource relationships

### Critical User Scenarios
- Validating a complex Terraform configuration for AWS resources
- Comparing the same configuration file across development, staging, and production
- Scanning configuration files for accidentally committed secrets
- Identifying unauthorized changes to deployed cloud infrastructure
- Visualizing the architecture defined in infrastructure code

### Performance Benchmarks
- Validation should process >500 lines of configuration per second
- Environment variable rendering should handle >100 substitutions per second
- Secret scanning should process >1MB of configuration text per second
- Drift detection should handle >20 resources per second
- Visualization should generate output in <2 seconds for 50 resources

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely large infrastructure definitions (>10,000 lines)
- Configurations with complex variable dependencies
- Partial cloud provider API failures during drift detection
- Custom or extension resource types not in standard schemas
- Rate limiting from cloud provider APIs

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >90% code coverage for validation logic
- >95% coverage for secret detection patterns
- >85% coverage for environment variable processing
- >90% coverage for drift detection
- >85% overall project coverage

## Success Criteria
- Configuration validation catches all syntax errors and common logical mistakes
- Environment variable rendering correctly shows effective configuration for each target
- Secret detection identifies all common credential patterns with minimal false positives
- Drift detection accurately reports differences between code and deployed resources
- Visualization provides clear understanding of infrastructure relationships
- Sophia can confidently manage infrastructure across multiple cloud platforms with reduced error rates

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed for testing with sample infrastructure-as-code files.
