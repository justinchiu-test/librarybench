# Technical Documentation Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editing library designed for technical documentation writers working with mixed content formats. This implementation focuses on code sample validation, documentation-specific linting, multi-format preview, API reference integration, and screenshot automation to ensure technical accuracy and consistency in software documentation.

## Persona Description
Carlos creates software documentation combining code examples, command sequences, and explanatory text. He needs specialized features for working with mixed content while ensuring technical accuracy.

## Key Requirements

1. **Code Sample Validation**
   - Implement an automated testing system for embedded code examples
   - Critical for Carlos as it ensures code snippets in documentation actually work, preventing outdated or incorrect examples
   - Must support multiple programming languages, validate syntax, and execute code in isolated environments to verify functionality

2. **Documentation-Specific Linting**
   - Develop comprehensive linting tools for documentation content
   - Essential for maintaining clarity, completeness, and terminology consistency across technical documents
   - Must check for technical accuracy, style guide compliance, terminology consistency, and readability metrics

3. **Multi-Format Preview**
   - Create a system to render documentation content in different output formats
   - Crucial for ensuring content displays correctly across various documentation systems and formats
   - Must support common documentation formats (Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, etc.) with accurate rendering simulation

4. **API Reference Integration**
   - Build functionality to automatically update examples when underlying APIs change
   - Allows documentation to stay synchronized with code changes, reducing maintenance burden
   - Must connect to code repositories, extract API definitions, and identify affected documentation sections

5. **Screenshot Automation**
   - Implement tools for generating terminal captures from command sequences
   - Provides consistent and accurate visual examples of command-line operations
   - Must execute commands in controlled environments and capture formatted output for inclusion in documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Code validation must be testable across multiple programming languages
- Linting rules must be verifiable with sample documentation content
- Format rendering must be testable against reference outputs
- API synchronization must be verifiable with sample code changes
- Screenshot generation must produce consistent outputs for testing

### Performance Expectations
- Code validation should complete within 2 seconds per example
- Linting should process at least 1000 words per second
- Format conversion should render within 500ms per page
- API synchronization should identify affected sections within 5 seconds
- Screenshot generation should complete within 3 seconds per command

### Integration Points
- Code execution environments for various languages
- Style guide and terminology databases
- Documentation format renderers
- Source code repositories and API definitions
- Virtual terminal environments for command execution

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be accessible programmatically with no UI dependencies
- Code execution must occur in isolated, secure environments
- API integration must be configurable for different project structures
- The system must work with various documentation formats and styles
- Operations should be automatable for integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Core Functionality

The implementation should provide a comprehensive technical documentation editing library with:

1. **Code Validation Engine**
   - Multi-language syntax checking
   - Isolated execution environments
   - Output validation against expected results
   - Dependency resolution for execution contexts

2. **Documentation Quality Framework**
   - Technical accuracy verification
   - Style guide enforcement
   - Terminology consistency checking
   - Readability and clarity analysis

3. **Format Transformation System**
   - Multi-format parsing and rendering
   - Style preservation across formats
   - Layout simulation for various outputs
   - Cross-reference and link validation

4. **API Synchronization Module**
   - Code repository connectors
   - API definition extraction
   - Change detection algorithms
   - Automated example updating

5. **Command Visualization Tools**
   - Virtual terminal environment
   - Command execution sandbox
   - Output formatting and capture
   - Image generation and optimization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate validation of code samples in multiple languages
- Proper identification of documentation style and terminology issues
- Correct rendering of content in various documentation formats
- Appropriate updating of examples when APIs change
- Reliable generation of terminal screenshots from commands

### Critical User Scenarios
- Validating a technical documentation set with embedded code examples
- Checking documentation against company style guidelines
- Converting content between documentation systems
- Updating documentation after a major API version change
- Generating a series of command-line examples for a tutorial

### Performance Benchmarks
- Code validation should handle >50 examples per minute
- Linting should process >30,000 words per minute
- Format conversion should handle >100 pages per minute
- API synchronization should process >1,000 API endpoints per minute
- Screenshot generation should produce >30 images per minute

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Code examples with external dependencies
- Complex multi-language documentation
- API changes that fundamentally alter behavior
- Commands requiring interactive input
- Extremely large documentation sets (>1000 pages)

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >90% code coverage for code validation system
- >95% coverage for linting rules
- >90% coverage for format transformation
- >85% coverage for API synchronization
- >90% overall project coverage

## Success Criteria
- Code samples in documentation are consistently valid and functional
- Documentation meets style guide requirements with consistent terminology
- Content displays correctly across all target documentation systems
- Examples stay synchronized with API changes with minimal manual intervention
- Command line screenshot generation is consistent and accurate
- Carlos can produce high-quality technical documentation with improved efficiency and accuracy

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed for testing with sample documentation content.
