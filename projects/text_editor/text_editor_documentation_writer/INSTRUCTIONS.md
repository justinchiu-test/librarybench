# Technical Documentation Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editor library designed for technical documentation writers, focusing on code sample validation, documentation-specific linting, multi-format preview, API reference integration, and automated screenshot generation. This implementation prioritizes maintaining technical accuracy while supporting the unique needs of documentation that combines code, commands, and explanatory text.

## Persona Description
Carlos creates software documentation combining code examples, command sequences, and explanatory text. He needs specialized features for working with mixed content while ensuring technical accuracy.

## Key Requirements
1. **Code Sample Validation Engine**: Implement a system that automatically tests embedded code examples for correctness, syntax errors, and compatibility with referenced library versions. This is critical for Carlos to ensure that all code examples in documentation actually work as described, preventing frustration for users who rely on the documentation.

2. **Documentation-Specific Linting**: Create a comprehensive linting framework that checks for clarity, completeness, terminology consistency, and documentation best practices. This helps Carlos maintain high-quality documentation that follows style guides and avoids common technical writing pitfalls.

3. **Multi-Format Preview Generator**: Develop a system that shows how documentation content will appear when rendered in different documentation systems (Markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, PDF, etc.). This addresses Carlos's need to write content that will display correctly across multiple output formats used by different documentation platforms.

4. **API Reference Integration**: Build functionality that connects to API definitions and automatically updates examples when APIs change. This ensures that Carlos's documentation stays synchronized with the latest API signatures, preventing documentation drift as software evolves.

5. **Command Sequence Capture**: Implement a tool that automates generating terminal captures and screenshots from written command sequences. This allows Carlos to efficiently create visual examples that accurately represent the commands described in the documentation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Code sample validation must be verifiable against known working and broken examples
  - Linting rules must provide consistent results for identical inputs
  - Format preview generation must be testable for rendering accuracy
  - API reference synchronization must be testable with versioned API definitions
  - Command sequence capture must produce consistent outputs for identical inputs

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Code validation should complete within 3 seconds for typical examples
  - Linting should process documentation at a rate of at least 1MB per minute
  - Format preview generation should complete within 5 seconds per format
  - API reference checking should complete within 10 seconds for documentation referencing 100+ APIs
  - Command sequence capture should process instructions within timeframes appropriate to the commands

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for multiple programming language interpreters and compilers
  - Integration with documentation style guides and linting rules
  - Compatibility with common documentation rendering engines
  - Connectivity with API definition formats (OpenAPI, GraphQL, etc.)
  - Integration with terminal emulation for command capture

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must validate code in multiple programming languages
  - Must handle mixed content (text, code, commands, images) seamlessly
  - Must support documentation formats used by major documentation systems
  - Must operate without requiring access to production systems for API validation
  - Must isolate command execution for safety and reproducibility

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Mixed Content Document Model**: A representation system for documents containing text, code blocks, command sequences, and embedded media.

2. **Code Execution Environment**: A secure sandbox for testing code samples in various programming languages.

3. **Documentation Style Checking**: A comprehensive framework for validating documentation against style guides and best practices.

4. **Format Conversion Engine**: Tools for generating previews in different documentation formats.

5. **API Definition Parser**: Components for reading and understanding API specifications from various formats.

6. **Command Execution Capture**: A secure environment for running and capturing output from command sequences.

7. **Documentation Analytics**: Tools for measuring documentation completeness, accuracy, and quality.

The library should use specialized parsing strategies optimized for mixed-content documents. It should provide programmatic interfaces for all functions without requiring a graphical interface, allowing it to be integrated with various documentation workflows and continuous integration systems.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of code sample validation across different languages
  - Correctness of linting against documentation standards
  - Fidelity of format previews compared to actual rendered output
  - Accuracy of API reference synchronization with changing definitions
  - Quality of command sequence captures for documentation

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Writing multilingual API documentation with code examples
  - Checking documentation against organizational style guides
  - Preparing documentation for publication in multiple formats
  - Updating documentation when underlying APIs change
  - Creating visual tutorials with command sequences and screenshots

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Code validation should support at least 10 different programming languages
  - Linting should check at least 50 documentation best practices
  - Format preview should support at least 5 common documentation formats
  - API synchronization should handle definitions with 1000+ endpoints
  - Command capture should support sequences of at least 20 consecutive commands

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling code samples that require complex dependencies
  - Providing useful feedback for subtle documentation issues
  - Managing inconsistencies between different output formats
  - Dealing with API changes that break backward compatibility
  - Safely handling potentially destructive command sequences

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90% line coverage for code validation functionality
  - 95% coverage for documentation linting rules
  - 85% coverage for format conversion engines
  - 90% coverage for API reference handling
  - 95% coverage for command execution and capture

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Code samples in documentation can be automatically validated for correctness across multiple programming languages.

2. Documentation consistently meets style guidelines and best practices through automated linting.

3. Content appears correctly when rendered in different documentation systems and formats.

4. Examples and references stay synchronized with changing API definitions.

5. Terminal captures and screenshots can be automatically generated from written command sequences.

6. Documentation quality and accuracy can be measured and tracked over time.

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the implementation for technical documentation workflows.
