# Secure Malware Analysis Text Editor

## Overview
A highly specialized text editing library designed for security researchers analyzing suspicious code and malware samples. This implementation focuses on sandbox isolation, binary visualization, pattern matching, safe execution environments, and obfuscation analysis to enable deep investigation of potentially malicious code while maintaining system security.

## Persona Description
Priya analyzes suspicious code and malware samples as part of security investigations. She needs specialized editor features for safely handling potentially malicious files while performing deep analysis.

## Key Requirements

1. **Sandbox Mode**
   - Implement a secure isolation system that prevents executed or evaluated code from accessing system resources
   - Critical for Priya as it allows safe examination and testing of potentially malicious code without risking system compromise
   - Must provide complete isolation while still allowing controlled observation of code behavior

2. **Binary Visualization Tools**
   - Develop advanced visualization for hexadecimal, binary, and various encoded data formats
   - Essential for identifying patterns in binary data and understanding non-textual components of malware
   - Must provide side-by-side views of multiple representations (hex, ASCII, decoded formats) with pattern highlighting

3. **Pattern Matching for Security Signatures**
   - Create specialized search capabilities for identifying potential malware signatures across large codebases
   - Crucial for finding known malicious patterns and revealing relationships between different code samples
   - Must support complex pattern definitions, including byte sequences, regular expressions, and semantic patterns

4. **Safe Execution Environment**
   - Build a contained execution system for running selected code in isolated containers
   - Allows observation of runtime behavior while preventing any impact on the host system
   - Must track system calls, network activity, file operations, and other behaviors that reveal malicious intent

5. **Obfuscation Analysis Tools**
   - Implement detection and unwrapping mechanisms for common code hiding techniques
   - Provides capabilities to reveal the true functionality of intentionally obscured malicious code
   - Must identify and decode common obfuscation techniques like string encoding, control flow obfuscation, and packing

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Sandbox isolation must be verifiable for security boundaries
- Binary visualization must be testable with known binary patterns
- Pattern matching must be testable against signature databases
- Execution environment must be tested for proper isolation
- Obfuscation analysis must be verifiable against known techniques

### Performance Expectations
- Binary visualization should handle files up to 100MB with interactive responsiveness
- Pattern matching should scan at least 10MB per second
- Sandbox operations should initialize within 3 seconds
- Safe execution should maintain performance within 20% of native execution
- Obfuscation analysis should process common techniques in under 30 seconds

### Integration Points
- Containerization or virtualization technologies
- Binary analysis frameworks
- Signature databases and threat intelligence sources
- System call monitoring interfaces
- Disassembly and decompilation tools

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must maintain strict security isolation
- The system must not expose sensitive data to external services
- Operations must be traceable and auditable for compliance requirements
- The architecture must allow for air-gapped operation
- Performance overhead must be reasonable for working with large malware collections

## Core Functionality

The implementation should provide a comprehensive security research editing library with:

1. **Secure Containment System**
   - Isolation architecture for malicious code
   - Resource access monitoring and control
   - Policy enforcement for execution boundaries
   - Audit logging for all containment events

2. **Multi-Format Data Visualization**
   - Hexadecimal editor with pattern highlighting
   - Multiple encoding views (Base64, various ciphers)
   - Structure recognition (PE files, shellcode patterns)
   - Visual pattern analysis tools

3. **Security Pattern Detection**
   - Signature matching against threat databases
   - Heuristic pattern recognition
   - Cross-file similarity analysis
   - Custom pattern definition language

4. **Isolated Execution Framework**
   - Containerized runtime environments
   - Behavior monitoring and recording
   - Network activity simulation
   - System call tracking and analysis

5. **Code Deobfuscation Tools**
   - String decoding and reconstruction
   - Control flow normalization
   - Unpacking and de-minification
   - Layer-by-layer obfuscation removal

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Complete isolation of potentially malicious code
- Accurate visualization of binary and encoded data
- Effective detection of security signature patterns
- Safe execution with comprehensive monitoring
- Successful analysis of obfuscated code samples

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing a sophisticated malware sample with multiple obfuscation layers
- Searching a large codebase for signs of a particular attack pattern
- Executing suspicious code to observe its behavior without risk
- Comparing binary structures across multiple related samples
- Deobfuscating heavily disguised malicious code

### Performance Benchmarks
- Binary visualization should maintain interactivity for files up to 100MB
- Pattern matching should scan >10MB of code per second
- Sandbox initialization should complete in <3 seconds
- Safe execution should maintain at least 80% of native performance
- Obfuscation analysis should handle common techniques in <30 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Sandbox escape attempts by sophisticated malware
- Extremely large binary files (>1GB)
- Custom or previously unseen obfuscation techniques
- Resource exhaustion attacks within the sandbox
- Polymorphic code that changes its signature

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >95% code coverage for sandbox isolation mechanisms
- >90% coverage for binary visualization
- >90% coverage for pattern matching
- >95% coverage for execution environment
- >90% overall project coverage

## Success Criteria
- Malicious code is completely contained without risk to the host system
- Binary data patterns are clearly visualized for analysis
- Security signatures are effectively matched across large codebases
- Code execution behavior is accurately monitored in isolation
- Obfuscation techniques are successfully detected and unwrapped
- Priya can safely analyze malware samples with comprehensive tools and protection

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed for testing with sample security analysis scenarios.
