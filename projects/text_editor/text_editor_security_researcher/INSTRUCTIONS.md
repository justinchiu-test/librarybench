# Secure Code Analysis Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editor library designed for security researchers, focusing on safe handling of malicious code, binary visualization, pattern matching, isolated execution, and obfuscation analysis. This implementation prioritizes security while providing powerful tools for analyzing suspicious code and malware samples.

## Persona Description
Priya analyzes suspicious code and malware samples as part of security investigations. She needs specialized editor features for safely handling potentially malicious files while performing deep analysis.

## Key Requirements
1. **Execution Sandbox Environment**: Implement a secure containment system that prevents executed or evaluated code from accessing system resources while still allowing analysis of runtime behavior. This is critical for Priya to observe how suspicious code behaves without risking compromise of her analysis environment or connected systems.

2. **Multi-representation Binary Visualization**: Create a sophisticated visualization system showing file content simultaneously in multiple representations (hexadecimal, ASCII, various encodings, disassembly). This helps Priya identify patterns, hidden data, and obfuscated code that might not be apparent in a single representation.

3. **Advanced Pattern Detection Engine**: Develop a powerful pattern matching system that can identify potential malware signatures, known exploit techniques, and suspicious coding patterns across large codebases. This enables Priya to quickly pinpoint areas of concern in large files or across multiple files during security investigations.

4. **Isolated Execution Framework**: Build a secure execution environment capable of running selected code segments in instrumented, isolated containers with monitoring and resource limitations. This allows Priya to safely observe actual code behavior with controlled inputs while capturing detailed execution metrics without risk to host systems.

5. **Obfuscation Analysis Toolkit**: Implement specialized tools for detecting and unwrapping common code hiding techniques including encoding, encryption, packing, and polymorphism. This addresses Priya's need to reveal the true functionality of deliberately obscured malicious code that uses obfuscation to evade detection.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Sandbox isolation must be verifiable with escape attempt tests
  - Binary visualization must be testable for accuracy across file types
  - Pattern detection must be benchmarkable against known malware databases
  - Execution environment must demonstrate complete isolation from host
  - Obfuscation unwrapping must be testable with known techniques

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Binary visualization should render changes in real-time for files up to 10MB
  - Pattern matching should process at least 1MB per second
  - Isolated execution should add minimal overhead to normal execution time
  - The system should efficiently handle large suspicious files (100MB+)
  - Obfuscation analysis should process common techniques in under 30 seconds

- **Integration Points**:
  - Integration with malware signature databases
  - Support for common disassembly and binary analysis tools
  - Compatibility with containerization technologies for isolation
  - Integration with dynamic analysis frameworks
  - Support for exporting findings to standard security report formats

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must prevent any unauthorized system access from analyzed code
  - Must maintain analysis integrity when dealing with anti-analysis techniques
  - Must never automatically execute suspicious code without explicit permission
  - Must preserve chain of custody for forensic investigations
  - Must operate effectively without internet access (air-gapped environments)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Secure Content Handling**: Components for safely storing, displaying, and manipulating potentially malicious content.

2. **Multi-format Binary Viewer**: A system for visualizing file contents in multiple representations simultaneously.

3. **Pattern Matching Engine**: Tools for identifying suspicious patterns, signatures, and code constructs.

4. **Execution Containment**: A secure framework for running code in isolated environments with monitoring.

5. **Obfuscation Detection**: Algorithms for identifying and unwrapping obfuscated code.

6. **Analysis Reporting**: Mechanisms for documenting findings and generating security reports.

7. **File Forensics**: Utilities for extracting metadata and hidden information from files.

The library should use advanced security practices throughout its implementation. It should provide programmatic interfaces for all functions without requiring a graphical interface, allowing it to be integrated with various security workflows and analysis pipelines.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Effectiveness of sandbox isolation against various escape attempts
  - Accuracy of binary visualization across different file types and encodings
  - Precision of pattern matching against known malicious signatures
  - Security of isolated execution environment under various attack vectors
  - Success rate of obfuscation analysis against common hiding techniques

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Analyzing suspicious email attachments for malicious code
  - Investigating potential zero-day exploits in compiled binaries
  - Detecting hidden payloads in seemingly innocent files
  - Safely observing the behavior of ransomware or other malware
  - Unwrapping multiple layers of obfuscation to reveal core functionality

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Sandbox initialization should complete within 5 seconds
  - Binary visualization should render at least 20 views per second during scrolling
  - Pattern matching should support at least 10,000 signatures with minimal performance impact
  - Isolated execution should add no more than 20% overhead to normal execution time
  - Obfuscation analysis should process at least 1MB of obfuscated code per minute

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling files specifically designed to crash analysis tools
  - Managing extremely large malware samples or binary files
  - Dealing with sophisticated anti-analysis techniques
  - Recovering from containment failures safely
  - Processing files with deliberately corrupted structures

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 100% line coverage for sandbox isolation mechanisms
  - 95% coverage for binary visualization engines
  - 90% coverage for pattern matching algorithms
  - 100% coverage for execution containment security barriers
  - 90% coverage for obfuscation analysis tools

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It provides a secure environment for analyzing malicious code without risk to host systems.

2. Binary visualization effectively reveals patterns and anomalies in suspicious files.

3. Pattern matching accurately identifies known malicious signatures and suspicious code constructs.

4. Isolated execution safely allows observation of runtime behavior with detailed monitoring.

5. Obfuscation analysis successfully reveals hidden functionality in deliberately obscured code.

6. Security researchers can perform comprehensive analysis without requiring additional specialized tools.

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the security, reliability, and effectiveness of the implementation for malware analysis.
