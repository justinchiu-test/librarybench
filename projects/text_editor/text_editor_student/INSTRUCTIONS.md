# Programming Learning Editor Library

## Overview
A text editor library specifically designed for computer science students, focusing on progressive skill development, educational features, customization capabilities, and tools that support the learning journey. This implementation prioritizes features that help students understand editor internals while providing functionality that grows with their programming skills.

## Persona Description
Jamal is learning about software development and text editor implementation. He wants to understand the inner workings of editors while having a tool that grows with his programming capabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **Progressive Interface System**: Implement a framework that reveals features and complexity gradually based on user skill level and preferences. This is critical for Jamal to avoid being overwhelmed by advanced functionality while still having access to more sophisticated features as his skills develop, creating a learning path that parallels his educational journey.

2. **Annotated Implementation Explorer**: Create a system that provides access to the editor's own source code with educational annotations, documentation, and guided exploration paths. This enables Jamal to understand how the editor itself is implemented, serving as a practical learning resource for software development concepts.

3. **Customization Laboratory**: Develop a safe, sandboxed environment where different editor behaviors, algorithms, and features can be modified and tested without breaking the core functionality. This allows Jamal to experiment with different implementation approaches and understand their implications for performance and user experience.

4. **Programming Interview Preparation System**: Build a framework for practicing common programming challenges with integrated timing, constraints, and evaluation. This helps Jamal prepare for technical interviews by simulating the environment and providing immediate feedback on his solutions.

5. **Study Session Tracker**: Implement a comprehensive tracking system for coding sessions that monitors time spent, concepts practiced, and progress toward learning goals. This addresses Jamal's need to maintain consistent study habits and review periodically to reinforce learning.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Progressive interface transitions must be testable for feature availability at different levels
  - Source code annotation access must be verifiable for educational content
  - Customization experiments must be isolatable and testable without affecting core functionality
  - Interview preparation exercises must verify solution correctness and performance
  - Study tracking metrics must be consistently measurable and reportable

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Interface complexity adjustments should be instantaneous (under 100ms)
  - Source code access and annotation rendering should complete within 1 second
  - Customization experiments should provide immediate feedback on changes
  - Interview preparation environment should simulate realistic constraints
  - Study tracking should have negligible performance impact during coding sessions

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for integrating educational resources and documentation
  - Compatibility with common programming exercise formats and evaluation criteria
  - Integration with version control systems for tracking experimental changes
  - Support for exporting study data in standard formats for analysis
  - Integration with code evaluation and testing frameworks

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must maintain editor stability even when experimental features are being tested
  - Must provide accurate educational content about editor internals
  - Must enforce safety boundaries to prevent experimental code from causing crashes
  - Must support a wide range of programming languages for exercises
  - Must balance guidance with discovery to promote learning

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Skill-Based Feature Management**: A system for organizing and revealing features based on user progress and skill development.

2. **Self-Documentation System**: Components for accessing, displaying, and navigating the editor's own source code with educational annotations.

3. **Experimental Sandbox**: A framework for safely testing modifications to editor behavior and algorithms.

4. **Programming Challenge Engine**: Tools for defining, attempting, and evaluating common programming exercises.

5. **Learning Analytics**: Mechanisms for tracking and reporting on coding activity and learning progress.

6. **Customizable Editor Core**: A modular, well-documented implementation of core text editing functionality that can be understood and modified.

The library should use clear, educational implementation patterns that serve as good examples for learning programmers. It should provide programmatic interfaces for all functions without requiring a graphical interface, allowing it to be used as a learning tool even while studying the implementation itself.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct progression of feature availability across different skill levels
  - Accuracy and educational value of source code annotations
  - Safety and effectiveness of the experimental sandbox
  - Correctness of programming challenge evaluation
  - Accuracy of study session tracking and reporting

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - A beginner using basic editing features while learning fundamentals
  - An intermediate student exploring the editor's implementation to understand concepts
  - An advanced student experimenting with alternative algorithms in the sandbox
  - A job-seeking student practicing common interview questions
  - A dedicated learner tracking progress toward mastery of programming concepts

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Feature management should add no more than 50ms overhead to operations
  - Source code access should render annotations at a rate of at least 1000 lines per second
  - Experimental modifications should be isolated with no impact on core performance
  - Programming challenges should execute and evaluate within timeframes appropriate to their complexity
  - Study tracking should consume less than 5MB of memory during extended sessions

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling invalid or unsafe experimental code modifications
  - Providing useful feedback when programming challenges have subtle errors
  - Maintaining data integrity when study sessions are interrupted
  - Recovering gracefully from failures in experimental features
  - Handling transitions between skill levels without disrupting work in progress

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90% line coverage for progressive interface management
  - 85% coverage for educational annotation systems
  - 95% coverage for sandbox isolation mechanisms
  - 90% coverage for programming challenge evaluation
  - 85% coverage for study session tracking

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It provides a clear progression path from basic editing to advanced features that aligns with typical computer science education.

2. The self-documentation system effectively teaches editor implementation concepts through annotated source code.

3. The experimental sandbox allows safe modification and testing of editor components without breaking core functionality.

4. The programming challenge system effectively prepares students for technical interviews through realistic exercises.

5. The study tracking system provides meaningful insights into learning progress and habits.

6. The editor itself serves as an educational example of good software design and implementation.

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and educational effectiveness of the implementation.

To set up the virtual environment, use `uv venv` from within the project directory. The environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
