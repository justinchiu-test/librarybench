# Educational Text Editor Library for Computer Science Students

## Overview
A learning-focused text editing library designed specifically for computer science students to understand editor implementation while developing their programming skills. This implementation focuses on progressive feature complexity, annotated source code, customization experimentation, interview preparation, and study session management to create an educational tool that grows with the student's capabilities.

## Persona Description
Jamal is learning about software development and text editor implementation. He wants to understand the inner workings of editors while having a tool that grows with his programming capabilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Progressive Complexity Interface**
   - Implement a layered API with gradually increasing feature complexity
   - Critical for Jamal as it allows him to start with basic functionality and progressively access advanced features as his skills develop
   - Must include clear documentation and learning paths explaining how each layer builds upon previous concepts

2. **Implementation Learning Mode**
   - Develop an annotated codebase with detailed explanations of core algorithms and design patterns
   - Essential for understanding the inner workings of text editors by exploring well-documented implementation details
   - Must include guided extension projects that encourage exploration and modification of the editor's core functionality

3. **Customization Playground**
   - Create a sandbox environment for safely experimenting with different behaviors and algorithms
   - Crucial for hands-on learning through experimentation with different implementation approaches
   - Must provide immediate feedback on the effects of modifications and performance implications

4. **Interview Preparation Tools**
   - Build functionality for practicing common programming challenges relevant to technical interviews
   - Helps Jamal prepare for software engineering interviews by combining editor learning with coding practice
   - Must include problem sets, timing functions, and evaluation metrics for solution quality

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed for educational purposes with clear code organization and documentation.
