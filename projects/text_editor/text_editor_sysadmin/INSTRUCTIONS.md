# Remote Configuration File Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editor library for system administrators that focuses on secure, reliable remote file editing, configuration validation, and change tracking. This implementation prioritizes handling network interruptions, validating configuration syntax, managing privileges for system files, and synchronizing changes across multiple servers.

## Persona Description
Raj manages hundreds of servers and needs to edit configuration files directly on remote systems. He requires a lightweight yet powerful editor that works well over SSH connections with minimal latency and resource usage.

## Key Requirements
1. **Resilient Remote File Access System**: Implement a robust remote file editing mechanism over SSH/SFTP that can detect network interruptions, automatically reconnect, and resume editing sessions without data loss. This is critical for Raj's work in environments with unstable connections or when managing servers in different geographic locations.

2. **Configuration Syntax Validation Engine**: Create a validation system for common server configuration files (nginx, Apache, systemd, etc.) that checks syntax before saving changes. This helps Raj prevent configuration errors that could take servers offline or cause service disruptions.

3. **Privilege Escalation Management**: Develop a secure mechanism to handle editing of protected system files, including credential management, sudo/su operations, and tracking of privileged changes. This allows Raj to safely modify critical system files without compromising security practices.

4. **Multi-Server Synchronization**: Build functionality for synchronized editing across multiple identical servers, allowing changes to be tested on one system before being deployed to others. This addresses Raj's need to maintain configuration consistency across server farms.

5. **Change Tracking and Backup System**: Implement an automatic backup and change tracking system that preserves original files before modifications and maintains an audit log of all changes. This provides Raj with rollback capabilities and documentation of all configuration changes for compliance and troubleshooting.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All remote operations must be testable with mock SSH/SFTP servers
  - Configuration validation must be testable with sample configuration files
  - Privilege escalation must be testable without actual root access
  - Multi-server synchronization must be testable with simulated server environments
  - Change tracking must maintain verifiable history of all modifications

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Remote file operations should maintain responsiveness over connections with up to 500ms latency
  - Background synchronization should not interfere with active editing
  - Configuration validation should complete within 1 second for files up to 1MB
  - The system should operate with minimal memory footprint (under 100MB)
  - Operations should be optimized to minimize data transfer over network connections

- **Integration Points**:
  - Integration with standard SSH/SFTP libraries (paramiko, asyncssh)
  - Support for common authentication methods (password, key-based, certificates)
  - Integration with configuration file parsers for major server technologies
  - Support for standard Unix privilege escalation mechanisms
  - Compatibility with version control systems for change tracking

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must operate effectively over high-latency connections (up to 1 second)
  - Must handle intermittent connection failures gracefully
  - All operations must be logged for audit purposes
  - Must never store credentials in plaintext
  - Must prevent concurrent editing conflicts across multiple servers

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Secure Remote Connection Management**: A system for establishing, maintaining, and recovering SSH/SFTP connections to remote servers.

2. **Remote File Operations**: Methods for reading, writing, and tracking changes to files on remote systems.

3. **Configuration Validation**: Parsers and validators for common configuration file formats.

4. **Privilege Management**: Secure handling of elevated privileges for accessing protected files.

5. **Change Tracking**: A system for preserving original files and tracking modifications.

6. **Multi-Server Operations**: Tools for coordinating edits across multiple servers.

7. **Failure Recovery**: Mechanisms to handle network interruptions and recover editing sessions.

The library should use asynchronous operations where appropriate to maintain responsiveness over network connections. File operations should be atomic whenever possible to prevent corruption during network failures. The system should maintain local caches of remote files to enable offline editing with later synchronization.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of remote file operations (read, write, delete)
  - Reliability of connection recovery after interruptions
  - Correctness of configuration syntax validation
  - Security of privilege escalation mechanisms
  - Integrity of change tracking and backup system
  - Consistency of multi-server synchronization

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Editing configuration files over unstable network connections
  - Validating and correcting syntax errors in server configurations
  - Safely editing files requiring root access
  - Deploying consistent changes across multiple servers
  - Tracking and reverting changes when problems arise
  - Handling concurrent edit conflicts across servers

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Remote file operations should complete within 2 seconds over connections with 500ms latency
  - Configuration validation should complete within 1 second for typical files
  - Multi-server synchronization should scale linearly with number of servers
  - Recovery from network interruption should take no more than 5 seconds
  - Memory usage should remain under 100MB even when editing multiple files

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Network failure during write operations
  - Invalid credentials or permission issues
  - Corrupted configuration files
  - Disk space limitations on remote systems
  - Simultaneous edits by multiple users
  - Server reboots during editing sessions

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90% line coverage for core remote operations
  - 100% coverage for credential handling and security-critical code
  - 95% coverage for configuration validation logic
  - 90% coverage for multi-server synchronization
  - Comprehensive tests for all error recovery scenarios

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Remote file editing works reliably over connections with varying levels of latency and stability.

2. Configuration validation correctly identifies syntax errors in common server configuration formats.

3. Privileged file operations are performed securely without exposing credentials.

4. Changes can be synchronized across multiple servers with conflict detection and resolution.

5. Original files are preserved and all changes are properly tracked for audit and rollback purposes.

6. The system recovers gracefully from network failures and server interruptions.

7. Performance remains acceptable even over high-latency connections or when working with large configuration files.

8. All tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and security of the implementation.

To set up the virtual environment, use `uv venv` from within the project directory. The environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
