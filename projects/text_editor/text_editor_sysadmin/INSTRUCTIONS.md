# Remote Configuration Text Editor

A specialized text editor library for system administrators that focuses on remote file editing and configuration management.

## Overview

This project implements a text editor library specifically designed for system administrators who need to edit configuration files across multiple remote systems. It provides secure remote editing capabilities, configuration file validation, privilege escalation support, distributed editing synchronization, and change tracking with automatic backups.

## Persona Description

Raj manages hundreds of servers and needs to edit configuration files directly on remote systems. He requires a lightweight yet powerful editor that works well over SSH connections with minimal latency and resource usage.

## Key Requirements

1. **SSH/SFTP Direct Editing**: Implement a remote file access system that can securely connect to servers via SSH/SFTP, edit files remotely, and automatically reconnect after network interruptions. This is essential for Raj who constantly works with remote servers and needs reliable connections that maintain state even when network issues occur.

2. **Configuration File Syntax Validation**: Develop a validation system for common server technology configuration files (nginx, Apache, etc.) that can verify syntax correctness before saving changes. This prevents Raj from introducing configuration errors that could take servers offline or cause security vulnerabilities.

3. **Privilege Escalation Integration**: Create a secure mechanism to edit protected system files through appropriate privilege escalation methods (sudo, etc.). This allows Raj to edit restricted configuration files without compromising security practices or requiring constant password re-entry.

4. **Distributed Editing Synchronization**: Implement functionality to synchronize identical configuration changes across multiple servers simultaneously. This is critical for Raj to maintain consistency across server clusters and reduce the time spent making repetitive changes to similar systems.

5. **Change Tracking with Backups**: Develop an automatic backup system that preserves original files before modifications and tracks changes over time. This provides Raj with safeguards against configuration errors and allows quick rollback to previous working states when problems arise.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All remote file operations must be mockable for testing without actual remote servers
- Configuration validation must be testable with sample configuration files
- Privilege escalation mechanisms must be tested without requiring actual elevated privileges
- Synchronization operations must be verifiable across simulated server environments
- Change tracking must be testable with reproducible file history scenarios

### Performance Expectations
- Remote editing should maintain responsiveness with network latency up to 500ms
- Validation of configuration files should complete in under 1 second for files up to 1MB
- Parallel synchronization should scale efficiently up to 50 simultaneous servers
- File operations should use minimal memory overhead suitable for constrained environments
- Automatic reconnection should occur within 5 seconds of network restoration

### Integration Points
- SSH/SFTP libraries for secure remote connections
- Privileged command execution via sudo/su/etc.
- Configuration parsers for various server technologies
- Version control or diff tools for change tracking
- Server inventory management for multiple target systems

### Key Constraints
- No UI/UX components; all functionality should be implemented as library code
- Secure handling of authentication credentials with no plain-text storage
- Minimal dependencies to ensure deployment in restricted environments
- Efficient operation over high-latency connections
- Compatible with Python 3.8+ ecosystem

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The library should implement a text editor core with the following functionality:

1. A remote file access system that:
   - Establishes secure SSH/SFTP connections to remote servers
   - Handles authentication including key-based and password methods
   - Provides file read/write operations with proper locking
   - Automatically reconnects and resumes operations after connection loss

2. A configuration validation system that:
   - Parses and validates syntax for common server configurations
   - Provides detailed error information for invalid configurations
   - Supports extensible validation rules for different technologies
   - Offers suggestions for fixing common configuration errors

3. A privilege management system that:
   - Securely elevates privileges for editing protected files
   - Manages authentication for privileged operations
   - Maintains audit logging of privileged actions
   - Supports different escalation mechanisms (sudo, su, etc.)

4. A synchronization system that:
   - Applies identical changes to multiple remote targets
   - Verifies successful application across all systems
   - Handles failures with appropriate rollback mechanisms
   - Reports detailed synchronization status

5. A change tracking system that:
   - Automatically creates backups before modifications
   - Maintains a history of changes to each file
   - Provides diff capabilities between versions
   - Supports rollback to previous versions

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Remote file operations (read, write, etc.) work correctly with proper error handling
- Configuration validation correctly identifies valid and invalid configurations
- Privilege escalation properly manages elevated permissions for protected files
- Synchronization successfully applies changes across multiple target systems
- Change tracking creates accurate backups and maintains proper history

### Critical User Scenarios
- Editing a configuration file on a remote server with intermittent network connectivity
- Validating and fixing syntax errors in different types of configuration files
- Editing system files requiring elevated privileges
- Synchronizing configuration changes across a cluster of servers
- Tracking changes over time and rolling back to previous versions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Remote file operations should complete within 2x the time of local operations plus network latency
- Configuration validation should process at least 1MB of configuration data per second
- Synchronization should scale linearly with the number of target servers up to 50 servers
- Change tracking overhead should not exceed 10% of file operation time
- Memory usage should not exceed 100MB during normal operations

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling network interruptions during file operations
- Managing conflicting changes when synchronizing across multiple servers
- Dealing with permission denied scenarios during privilege escalation
- Recovering from partial failures during multi-server synchronization
- Handling extremely large configuration files (10MB+)

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all core modules
- 100% coverage of error handling paths
- Complete coverage of all public API methods
- All supported configuration formats must have validation tests
- All privilege escalation methods must have coverage

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Remote file editing works reliably even with intermittent network connectivity
2. Configuration validation correctly identifies issues in all supported formats
3. Privilege escalation securely enables editing of protected files
4. Synchronization successfully applies changes across multiple servers
5. Change tracking provides reliable backup and restoration capabilities

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. CRITICAL: For running tests and generating the required json report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a critical requirement for project completion.
