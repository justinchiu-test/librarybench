# Remote Configuration Text Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editing library designed for system administrators who need to manage configuration files across multiple remote servers. This implementation focuses on secure remote file operations, configuration validation, privilege management, distributed editing, and change tracking to provide robust tools for server administration.

## Persona Description
Raj manages hundreds of servers and needs to edit configuration files directly on remote systems. He requires a lightweight yet powerful editor that works well over SSH connections with minimal latency and resource usage.

## Key Requirements

1. **SSH/SFTP Direct Editing**
   - Implement secure remote file access with automatic reconnection after network interruptions
   - Critical for Raj as he needs to edit files on hundreds of remote systems without establishing new connections for each edit
   - Must maintain session state even when connections are temporarily lost, ensuring no work is lost during network fluctuations

2. **Configuration File Syntax Validation**
   - Develop validation tools for common server technologies (nginx, Apache, systemd, etc.)
   - Essential for preventing configuration errors that could take servers offline or create security vulnerabilities
   - Must provide immediate feedback on syntax errors, semantic issues, and potential security misconfigurations

3. **Privilege Escalation Integration**
   - Create a secure mechanism for editing protected system files requiring elevated permissions
   - Crucial for editing root-owned configuration files while maintaining the principle of least privilege
   - Must provide audit logging of all privileged operations for security compliance

4. **Distributed Editing Synchronization**
   - Build functionality to synchronize changes across multiple identical servers
   - Allows Raj to efficiently manage configuration across server clusters, ensuring consistency
   - Must include conflict detection and resolution when configurations have diverged

5. **Change Tracking with Automatic Backup**
   - Implement version control-like functionality that automatically backs up original files before modification
   - Provides safety net for recovering from problematic configuration changes that impact service availability
   - Must maintain an audit trail of all changes with the ability to revert to previous versions

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Remote file operations must be mockable for testing without actual remote servers
- Configuration validators must be testable with sample configuration files
- Privilege escalation mechanisms must be testable in non-privileged environments
- Synchronization operations must be verifiable with simulated server clusters
- Change tracking must be testable for correctness and data integrity

### Performance Expectations
- Remote file operations should complete within 200ms over typical network connections
- Syntax validation should run in under 100ms for files up to 1MB
- Distributed synchronization should scale linearly with the number of servers
- Operations must use minimal memory (<50MB) to function on resource-constrained management servers
- File diff and change tracking operations should complete in under 500ms

### Integration Points
- SSH/SFTP libraries for remote connectivity
- Authentication systems including key management and sudo/su mechanisms
- Configuration parsers for various server technologies
- Version control concepts for change tracking
- Logging systems for audit trails

### Key Constraints
- All operations must be secure by default with no cleartext credential storage
- The system must be usable over high-latency connections (up to 500ms ping)
- All functionality must be accessible programmatically with no UI dependencies
- Operations should be atomic where possible to prevent partial configurations
- Must operate with minimal dependencies on remote systems

## Core Functionality

The implementation should provide a comprehensive server configuration editing library with:

1. **Remote File Management System**
   - Secure connection handling for SSH/SFTP
   - Automatic session persistence and reconnection
   - Efficient file transfer minimizing data usage
   - Concurrent connection management

2. **Configuration Validation Framework**
   - Parsers for common configuration formats (YAML, TOML, INI, custom syntaxes)
   - Syntax and semantic validation
   - Best practice analysis
   - Security vulnerability detection

3. **Privilege Management System**
   - Secure credential handling
   - Just-in-time privilege escalation
   - Audit logging of privileged operations
   - Principle of least privilege enforcement

4. **Multi-Server Synchronization**
   - Server group management
   - Differential synchronization algorithms
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Verification of successful deployment

5. **Change Management System**
   - Automatic pre-change backups
   - Version history maintenance
   - Change annotation and documentation
   - Rollback capabilities

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Secure and reliable remote file operations
- Accurate configuration validation for various formats
- Proper privilege handling and security practices
- Consistent synchronization across multiple servers
- Reliable change tracking and version history

### Critical User Scenarios
- Editing mission-critical configuration files with validation
- Recovering from network interruptions during edit sessions
- Deploying configuration changes to multiple servers simultaneously
- Rolling back problematic configuration changes
- Managing files requiring different privilege levels

### Performance Benchmarks
- Remote file operations must complete in <200ms on a network with 100ms latency
- Validation of configuration files must complete in <100ms for 1MB files
- Synchronization to 10 servers should complete in <5 seconds
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB during normal operations
- CPU usage should remain below 10% on a modern server

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Network partitions during critical operations
- Partial failures during multi-server deployments
- Corrupted configuration files
- Permission denied scenarios
- Concurrent editing of the same file
- Server unavailability during synchronization

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >90% code coverage for core remote operations
- >95% coverage for privilege escalation mechanisms
- >85% coverage for configuration validators
- >90% coverage for synchronization logic
- >90% overall project coverage

## Success Criteria
- All remote file operations are secure, reliable, and resilient to network issues
- Configuration validation correctly identifies syntax errors and security issues
- Privilege escalation works seamlessly while maintaining security best practices
- Changes can be synchronized across server clusters with conflict resolution
- Complete change history is maintained with the ability to roll back to any previous state
- Raj can efficiently manage hundreds of servers with minimal manual intervention

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed for testing with mocked remote systems.
