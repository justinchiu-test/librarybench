# Accessible Text Editing Library

## Overview
A highly accessible text editor library designed specifically for vision-impaired developers, focusing on screen reader optimization, audio feedback, semantic document navigation, and keyboard-only workflows. This implementation prioritizes accessibility without compromising on powerful editing capabilities.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen has limited vision and uses screen readers and other assistive technologies. She needs a text editor with excellent accessibility that works well with screen readers while still providing powerful editing capabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **Screen Reader Optimization**: Implement a context-aware announcement system that provides meaningful information about document structure, code elements, and editing operations. This is critical for Dr. Chen to understand the structure and content of code without visual cues, enabling efficient navigation and comprehension through audio feedback.

2. **Audio Feedback System**: Create a comprehensive audio cue system that provides non-visual indicators for operations, states, and events within the editor. This helps Dr. Chen confirm actions, understand operation outcomes, and recognize state changes without requiring visual confirmation.

3. **Semantic Document Navigation**: Develop a navigation framework that allows movement through documents based on semantic structure (functions, classes, blocks) rather than visual layout. This addresses Dr. Chen's need to navigate efficiently through code by logical structure rather than by lines or visual positioning.

4. **Customizable Accessibility Theming**: Implement a system for defining high-contrast themes with customizable font characteristics and rendering options. This allows Dr. Chen to tailor the visual presentation to her specific vision needs, maximizing the usability of any residual vision.

5. **Keyboard-Only Workflow**: Build a comprehensive keyboard command system that eliminates any requirements for precise mouse positioning. This ensures Dr. Chen can perform all editing operations efficiently through keyboard shortcuts, maintaining her productivity without relying on visual targeting.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Screen reader announcements must be capturable and verifiable in tests
  - Audio feedback must be testable without requiring actual sound output
  - Navigation operations must be testable for expected document positioning
  - Theme customization must be verifiable for contrast ratios and accessibility standards
  - Keyboard workflow completeness must be testable for feature coverage

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Screen reader announcements must be generated within 50ms of context changes
  - Audio feedback must be synchronized with corresponding operations
  - Navigation operations should complete within 100ms even for large documents
  - Theme changes should apply immediately without processing delays
  - Keyboard commands should be responsive with no perceptible latency

- **Integration Points**:
  - Compatibility with standard screen reader technologies (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
  - Support for standard accessibility APIs (e.g., Windows UI Automation, macOS Accessibility)
  - Integration with text-to-speech engines for custom announcements
  - Support for standard keyboard input libraries for consistent command handling
  - Compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AAA guidelines where applicable

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must function effectively without requiring visual feedback
  - Must provide equivalent functionality accessible through non-visual means
  - Must never rely on color alone to convey information
  - Must support variable text scaling without layout breakdown
  - Must minimize cognitive load through consistent interaction patterns

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Accessible Text Buffer**: A text storage and manipulation system that maintains semantic information about content structure.

2. **Screen Reader Integration**: Components for generating appropriate announcements based on context and operations.

3. **Audio Feedback Framework**: A system for generating consistent audio cues for different operations and states.

4. **Semantic Document Model**: A representation of document structure that enables navigation by meaning rather than position.

5. **Accessibility Theme Engine**: Tools for defining and applying high-contrast visual representations.

6. **Keyboard Command System**: A comprehensive framework for keyboard-driven operation without mouse dependencies.

7. **Document Analysis**: Tools for extracting and representing semantic structure from various file types.

The library should use semantic data structures that preserve meaning alongside content. It should prioritize non-visual information representation and provide multiple redundant ways to access functionality. The implementation should follow universal design principles while specifically optimizing for screen reader users.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy and usefulness of screen reader announcements
  - Consistency and informativeness of audio feedback
  - Correctness of semantic navigation operations
  - Compliance of themes with accessibility standards
  - Completeness of keyboard command coverage

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Navigating and editing code files without visual feedback
  - Understanding document structure through screen reader announcements
  - Performing complex editing operations using keyboard shortcuts
  - Customizing the environment for specific visual needs
  - Receiving appropriate feedback for operations and state changes

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Screen reader announcements should be generated within 50ms
  - Command response time should be under 100ms for all operations
  - Document analysis should process at least 1000 lines per second
  - Theme switching should complete in under 200ms
  - Memory usage should remain under 150MB even for large documents

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling documents with complex or unusual structures
  - Providing useful feedback for unexpected errors
  - Maintaining accessibility during performance-intensive operations
  - Supporting extremely large font sizes without layout issues
  - Handling malformed documents while providing useful feedback

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 95% line coverage for screen reader announcement logic
  - 90% coverage for audio feedback systems
  - 95% coverage for navigation and document structure analysis
  - 90% coverage for theme management
  - 100% coverage for keyboard command handling

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Vision-impaired users can effectively navigate and edit documents using screen readers without requiring visual feedback.

2. Audio cues provide clear, consistent feedback for all editor operations and state changes.

3. Semantic navigation allows efficient movement through documents based on structure rather than visual layout.

4. Customizable themes meet WCAG 2.1 Level AAA standards for contrast and readability.

5. All functionality is accessible through keyboard commands without requiring mouse interaction.

6. Performance remains responsive even with accessibility features fully enabled.

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the implementation for vision-impaired users.
