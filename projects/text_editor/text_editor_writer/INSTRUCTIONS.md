# Creative Writing Assistant Library

## Overview
A text editor library specifically designed for fiction writers, focusing on distraction-free writing, narrative element tracking, non-linear document navigation, and draft management. The implementation prioritizes creative writing workflows and provides analytical tools that help authors manage and improve their content.

## Persona Description
Elena writes novels and short stories, focusing on creative writing rather than programming. She needs a distraction-free environment that helps manage narrative elements while providing powerful text manipulation capabilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **Focus Mode Text Management**: Implement a system that isolates and emphasizes the current paragraph or sentence while maintaining context, allowing the writer to concentrate on immediate content. This is critical for Elena to maintain creative flow by reducing distractions while preserving the ability to reference nearby text.

2. **Writing Analytics Engine**: Create a comprehensive text analysis system that tracks word count, reading level metrics (like Flesch-Kincaid), writing pace over time, and other statistical measures. This enables Elena to monitor her productivity, set and track goals, and assess the reading difficulty of her work.

3. **Narrative Element Tracking**: Develop a system that identifies, indexes, and cross-references character names, locations, plot elements, and other narrative components throughout a manuscript. This helps Elena maintain consistency in characters and plot elements across long works.

4. **Non-linear Document Navigation**: Implement a document navigation framework organized around narrative elements (scenes, chapters, character arcs) rather than linear line numbers. This allows Elena to move through her manuscript based on story structure rather than text positioning.

5. **Revision Management System**: Build functionality for tracking multiple drafts, marking revisions, comparing different versions, and selectively merging changes between drafts. This addresses Elena's need to manage the iterative writing process while maintaining the ability to experiment with different approaches.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All text analysis functions must provide consistent results for identical inputs
  - Navigation functions must maintain document integrity during transitions
  - Narrative element tracking must correctly identify references even with naming variations
  - Revision tracking must accurately identify and represent differences between versions
  - Performance metrics must be measurable with simulated writing sessions

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Focus mode transitions should be instantaneous (under 100ms)
  - Text analysis should run in the background without impacting writing experience
  - Element tracking should handle manuscripts up to novel length (>100,000 words)
  - Document navigation should be responsive even for very large documents
  - Draft comparison operations should complete within 3 seconds for full manuscripts

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for common manuscript formats (plain text, Markdown, RTF)
  - Export capabilities for industry-standard submission formats
  - Integration with natural language processing libraries for advanced analysis
  - Support for external backup and synchronization
  - Compatibility with standard diffing algorithms for revision comparison

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must operate effectively with minimal memory footprint for long writing sessions
  - Text analysis must not interrupt the writing flow
  - Narrative element tracking must balance accuracy with performance
  - Must preserve document structure during mode transitions
  - Must handle large documents (>100,000 words) without performance degradation

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The text editor library should implement:

1. **Text Buffer Management**: A system for storing and manipulating manuscript text with support for isolation and focus on specific segments.

2. **Text Analysis Engine**: Components for analyzing writing style, complexity, pace, and other metrics relevant to fiction writing.

3. **Narrative Element Detection**: Algorithms for identifying, tracking, and cross-referencing characters, locations, and other narrative elements.

4. **Document Structure Representation**: A system for representing and navigating documents based on narrative structure rather than just lines of text.

5. **Version Control for Drafts**: Mechanisms for tracking multiple drafts, identifying changes, and supporting selective merging.

6. **Writing Session Analytics**: Tools for capturing and analyzing writing sessions to track productivity and patterns.

The library should use advanced text data structures (piece tables or ropes) optimized for the operations most common in creative writing. It should provide programmatic interfaces for all functions without requiring a graphical interface, allowing it to be integrated with various front-ends or used headlessly for automation.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of text manipulation operations in different focus modes
  - Correctness of writing analytics and statistical measurements
  - Precision of narrative element detection and cross-referencing
  - Integrity of document navigation based on narrative structures
  - Reliability of revision tracking and draft management

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Extended writing sessions with frequent mode switches
  - Managing a full-length novel with numerous characters and locations
  - Comparing and selectively merging multiple draft versions
  - Analyzing writing patterns and productivity over time
  - Navigating complex narrative structures non-linearly

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Focus mode transitions should complete in under 100ms
  - Full manuscript analysis should complete in under 10 seconds for 100,000 words
  - Element detection should identify >95% of character references
  - Document navigation operations should respond in under 200ms
  - Draft comparison should process at least 10,000 words per second

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling extremely long paragraphs or sentences
  - Managing documents with complex nested structures
  - Processing unusual writing styles or experimental formats
  - Recovering from corrupted draft versions
  - Dealing with ambiguous narrative element references

- **Required Test Coverage**:
  - 90% line coverage for core text manipulation functions
  - 95% coverage for analytics and metrics calculations
  - 90% coverage for narrative element detection
  - 95% coverage for draft comparison and merging
  - Comprehensive tests for all public API functions

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Writers can effectively isolate and focus on specific portions of text while maintaining context.

2. Writing analytics provide accurate and useful metrics on document statistics and writing patterns.

3. Narrative element tracking correctly identifies and cross-references characters and locations throughout a manuscript.

4. Document navigation allows efficient movement through manuscripts based on narrative structure.

5. Revision management accurately tracks changes between drafts and supports selective merging.

6. Performance remains responsive even with novel-length documents (>100,000 words).

7. All tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of the implementation for creative writing workflows.

To set up the virtual environment, use `uv venv` from within the project directory. The environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
