# Narrative-Focused Text Editor Library

## Overview
A specialized text editing library designed for creative writers that focuses on narrative structure, writing analytics, and revision management. This implementation prioritizes features for managing long-form creative writing projects while providing sophisticated text analysis capabilities tailored to fiction writers.

## Persona Description
Elena writes novels and short stories, focusing on creative writing rather than programming. She needs a distraction-free environment that helps manage narrative elements while providing powerful text manipulation capabilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Focus Mode**
   - Implement an API for isolating and working with specific text segments (paragraphs, sentences)
   - Critical for Elena as it allows her to concentrate on perfecting individual sections of text without distractions from surrounding content
   - Must provide dynamic methods to isolate, highlight, and navigate between different narrative units

2. **Writing Statistics Tracking**
   - Develop comprehensive text analysis tools for tracking word count, reading level, and writing pace over time
   - Essential for monitoring productivity, maintaining consistent writing style, and ensuring appropriate complexity for target audiences
   - Must generate detailed reports on writing patterns, vocabulary diversity, and readability metrics

3. **Character and Plot Element Tracking**
   - Create a system for identifying, categorizing, and cross-referencing narrative elements across a manuscript
   - Crucial for maintaining consistency in character traits, plot details, and thematic elements throughout long-form writing
   - Must automatically detect names, locations, and key terms while allowing manual tagging and relationship mapping

4. **Non-linear Document Navigation**
   - Design an organizational system that enables navigation by narrative elements rather than sequential lines
   - Allows Elena to work with her document in terms of scenes, chapters, and narrative arcs instead of linear text
   - Must provide flexible document structure with intelligent grouping and reorganization capabilities

5. **Revision Marking with Multiple Draft Comparison**
   - Implement sophisticated version control specifically designed for creative writing workflows
   - Provides ability to track changes across multiple drafts and selectively merge revisions based on creative decisions
   - Must maintain complete revision history with visualization of how the text has evolved over time

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Text analysis algorithms must be testable with various writing samples and styles
- Focus mode functionality must be verifiable for different text segment types
- Character/plot tracking must be testable with prepared narrative texts
- Navigation and organizational features must be testable with structured document samples
- Revision tracking must be verifiable for correctness and data integrity

### Performance Expectations
- Text analysis should process at least 1,000 words per second
- Response time for focus mode transitions should be under 50ms
- Character and plot element detection should scale linearly with document size
- Navigation operations should complete in under 100ms even for documents over 100,000 words
- Revision comparisons should complete in under 2 seconds for full-length novels

### Integration Points
- Natural language processing libraries for text analysis
- Document model framework for representing narrative structures
- Statistical analysis for writing metrics
- Diff algorithms for revision tracking
- Entity recognition systems for character/plot detection

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be accessible via API with no UI dependencies
- The system must maintain document integrity during all operations
- Operations should be optimized for large documents (novels up to 200,000 words)
- The architecture should support offline operation for writing without internet connectivity
- Storage formats should be open and non-proprietary for long-term accessibility

## Core Functionality

The implementation should provide a comprehensive creative writing library with:

1. **Advanced Document Model**
   - Hierarchical representation of narrative elements (scenes, chapters, acts)
   - Sophisticated text segmentation (paragraphs, sentences, dialogue)
   - Metadata association with text elements
   - Customizable document structure

2. **Text Analysis Engine**
   - Word, sentence, and paragraph statistics
   - Reading level assessment (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
   - Style analysis (passive voice, adverb usage, etc.)
   - Pacing and rhythm detection

3. **Narrative Element Tracker**
   - Character detection and relationship mapping
   - Location and setting recognition
   - Timeline management
   - Thematic element tracking

4. **Organizational Navigation System**
   - Scene/chapter navigation and reordering
   - Tagging and categorization
   - Search and filtering by narrative elements
   - Outlining and structure visualization

5. **Revision Management System**
   - Multi-version document management
   - Change tracking and annotation
   - Selective merge and comparison
   - Revision history visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of text analysis and statistics
- Correct identification and tracking of narrative elements
- Proper functioning of non-linear navigation
- Integrity of document structure during reorganization
- Reliability of revision tracking and comparison

### Critical User Scenarios
- Working on a full-length novel manuscript (>100,000 words)
- Tracking characters and their development across multiple chapters
- Reorganizing scenes and chapters for improved narrative flow
- Comparing and merging different revision approaches
- Analyzing writing patterns across a series of works

### Performance Benchmarks
- Complete manuscript analysis should process >1,000 words per second
- Character and plot element detection should identify >90% of key elements
- Navigation operations should complete in <100ms for any document size
- Revision comparisons should handle documents with up to 50 revisions
- Memory usage should remain under 200MB even for novel-length documents

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Extremely long documents (>500,000 words)
- Unusual narrative structures (non-linear storytelling, multiple POVs)
- Documents with heavy use of specialized terminology
- Merge conflicts in revision comparison
- Recovery from interrupted operations

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- >90% code coverage for text analysis algorithms
- >85% coverage for narrative element detection
- >90% coverage for document structure management
- >95% coverage for revision tracking systems
- >85% overall project coverage

## Success Criteria
- Writers can efficiently isolate and focus on specific sections of their manuscript
- Statistical analysis provides meaningful insights into writing patterns and style
- Character and plot elements are accurately tracked throughout the document
- Navigation by narrative structure is intuitive and efficient
- Revision history provides clear visualization of how the manuscript has evolved
- Elena can manage complete novels with improved productivity and creative control

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies
uv init --lib

# Run a Python script
uv run python your_script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Focus on implementing the core functionality as library components with well-defined APIs. Remember that this implementation should have NO UI components and should be designed for testing with sample creative texts.
