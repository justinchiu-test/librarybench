# Virtual Machine Emulator Unification Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a unified library that serves both the parallel computing emulator (`vm_emulator`) and security research emulator (`secure_vm`) implementations. The goal is to identify common components, create a shared core library, and refactor each implementation to use these shared components.

## Common Components Analysis

After analyzing both implementations, we've identified the following common components:

### Core Abstractions

1. **Instruction Representation**
   - Both implementations have concepts of instructions with opcodes, operands, and types
   - Both track latency or cycles for performance measurement

2. **Memory System**
   - Both implement memory access (read/write operations)
   - Both track memory access events for analysis
   - Both have memory protection concepts (though with different complexity)

3. **Processor/CPU**
   - Both have register sets and processor states
   - Both implement instruction execution cycles
   - Both have privilege/security concepts (though with different focus)

4. **Virtual Machine**
   - Both coordinate execution of instructions using the processor and memory
   - Both track execution events and maintain execution traces
   - Both implement a step-based execution model

5. **Execution Tracing**
   - Both record detailed logs of operations for later analysis
   - Both implement forensic/diagnostic functionality

## Unified Architecture

### Core Library (`common`)

The unified library will be organized into the following components:

#### 1. `common.core.instruction`
- `InstructionType` (Enum): Categories of instructions (COMPUTE, MEMORY, BRANCH, SYNC, SYSTEM, SPECIAL)
- `Instruction` (Class): Base class for instruction representation with opcode, type, operands, and latency
- `InstructionSet` (Class): Collection of available instructions with metadata

#### 2. `common.core.memory`
- `MemoryAccessType` (Enum): Types of memory accesses (READ, WRITE, READ_MODIFY_WRITE)
- `MemoryAccess` (Class): Record of a memory access with address, type, and metadata
- `MemoryProtection` (Interface): Abstract protection mechanism
- `MemorySystem` (Class): Base memory system with read/write operations and access tracking

#### 3. `common.core.processor`
- `ProcessorState` (Enum): States of the processor (IDLE, RUNNING, WAITING, BLOCKED, TERMINATED)
- `Processor` (Class): Base processor with registers, program counter, and instruction execution
- `RegisterSet` (Class): Manages processor registers

#### 4. `common.core.vm`
- `VMState` (Enum): States of the VM (IDLE, RUNNING, PAUSED, FINISHED)
- `VirtualMachine` (Abstract Class): Base VM implementation with memory, processor, and execution control
- `ExecutionTrace` (Class): Records execution events for analysis

#### 5. `common.core.program`
- `Program` (Class): Representation of a program with instructions and data

#### 6. `common.core.exceptions`
- Common exception types for VM operations

### Extension Points

The unified architecture will provide clear extension points for specialized functionality:

1. **Security Extensions**
   - Memory protection mechanisms
   - Privilege enforcement
   - Control flow integrity
   - Attack simulation

2. **Parallelism Extensions**
   - Thread management
   - Synchronization primitives
   - Race detection
   - Memory coherence

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Create Base Classes and Interfaces

Start by implementing the core abstractions as base classes and interfaces that can be extended by the specialized implementations:

- `BaseMemorySystem`: Basic memory operations without specialized features
- `BaseProcessor`: Core instruction execution without specialized features
- `BaseVirtualMachine`: Framework for coordinating processors and memory

### 2. Extract Common Functionality

Move shared functionality from both implementations into the unified library:

- Common enums and data structures
- Shared instruction set definitions
- Basic memory read/write operations
- Basic processor execution logic
- Event logging and tracing

### 3. Implement Extension Mechanism

Design a plugin/extension system that allows each implementation to:

- Register custom instruction handlers
- Add specialized memory protection
- Implement thread synchronization
- Create custom execution tracers

### 4. Refactor Existing Implementations

Refactor each implementation to use the unified library:

#### vm_emulator Refactoring

1. Update imports to use common base classes
2. Extend base classes with parallel-specific functionality
3. Implement thread management and synchronization as extensions
4. Move race detection into specialized memory monitor
5. Ensure all tests pass with refactored implementation

#### secure_vm Refactoring

1. Update imports to use common base classes
2. Extend base classes with security-specific functionality
3. Implement protection mechanisms as extensions
4. Move control flow integrity into specialized processor extension
5. Ensure all tests pass with refactored implementation

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Create and Test Core Library

1. Implement core abstractions in `common` package
2. Write unit tests for common components
3. Validate basic functionality of common components separately

### Phase 2: Migrating vm_emulator

1. Create adapter classes where needed to bridge gaps
2. Refactor vm_emulator components one by one:
   - Replace memory implementation with common version
   - Replace processor implementation with common version
   - Replace VM implementation with common version
3. Run tests after each component migration to ensure functionality

### Phase 3: Migrating secure_vm

1. Create adapter classes where needed to bridge gaps
2. Refactor secure_vm components one by one:
   - Replace memory implementation with common version
   - Replace CPU implementation with common version
   - Replace emulator implementation with common version
3. Run tests after each component migration to ensure functionality

### Phase 4: Final Integration and Testing

1. Run tests for both implementations
2. Measure performance impact
3. Document any specialized behavior
4. Update README with unified architecture description

| `vm_emulator.core.memory` | `common.core.memory` |
| `vm_emulator.core.processor` | `common.core.processor` |
| `vm_emulator.core.vm` | `common.core.vm` |
| `vm_emulator.core.race` | `common.extensions.parallel.race` |
| `vm_emulator.synchronization` | `common.extensions.parallel.synchronization` |
| `vm_emulator.threading` | `common.extensions.parallel.threading` |

### secure_vm → common

| secure_vm Component | common Component |
|---------------------|------------------|
| `secure_vm.cpu` | `common.core.processor` + `common.extensions.security.cpu` |

| `secure_vm.emulator` | `common.core.vm` + `common.extensions.security.emulator` |
| `secure_vm.attacks` | `common.extensions.security.attacks` |

## Testing Strategy

- Create a common test suite for core components
- Maintain original test suites for specialized features
- Add integration tests for the unified system
- Run all original test cases to ensure backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Implement core library components
2. Create extension mechanisms
3. Refactor vm_emulator to use common library
4. Refactor secure_vm to use common library
5. Validate all tests passing
6. Document the unified architecture
