# Educational Pipeline-Visualization Virtual Machine

## Overview
A transparent virtual machine implementation designed specifically for teaching computer architecture fundamentals that clearly demonstrates the fetch-decode-execute cycle, memory management, and processor operation without the complexity of modern CPU designs.

## Persona Description
Dr. Rodriguez teaches undergraduate computer architecture courses and needs to help students understand CPU operation principles without the complexity of modern processor designs. She wants a transparent virtual machine that clearly demonstrates fundamental concepts like fetch-decode-execute cycles and memory management.

## Key Requirements
1. **Pipeline visualization showing each instruction passing through fetch-decode-execute stages**: Critical for Dr. Rodriguez to visually demonstrate the instruction lifecycle to students, making abstract concepts tangible and observable. The visualization must clearly show how instructions flow through each stage and how pipeline hazards are resolved.

2. **Microarchitecture simulation revealing how high-level instructions decompose into micro-operations**: This feature allows students to understand how complex instructions are broken down into simpler operations, providing insights into instruction-level parallelism and the internal workings of a CPU.

3. **Cycle-accurate timing model demonstrating performance impacts of different instruction sequences**: Essential for teaching students about performance optimization and helping them understand why certain code sequences execute faster than others, with precise cycle counting and timing visualization.

4. **Customizable architecture allowing modification of instruction set and memory model for comparison**: Enables Dr. Rodriguez to demonstrate different architecture designs in the classroom, comparing RISC vs. CISC approaches, or showing how different memory hierarchies impact performance.

5. **Lecture mode with annotation capabilities for highlighting specific concepts during classroom demonstrations**: Allows the professor to dynamically annotate the execution process during lectures, highlighting important concepts, potential bottlenecks, or interesting execution patterns to enhance student understanding.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All components must be unit-testable in isolation (pipeline stages, memory system, instruction execution)
  - Integration tests must verify correct pipeline operation and cycle timing
  - Architecture modifications must be testable through configuration files rather than code changes
  - Annotation system must be testable programmatically

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Must execute simple programs at a speed suitable for real-time classroom demonstration
  - Visualization generation should not significantly impact execution performance
  - Should support at least 10,000 instructions per second on standard hardware
  - Pipeline visualization must update in real-time during execution

- **Integration Points**:
  - Clean API for integrating custom instruction sets
  - Export interface for pipeline state and execution metrics
  - Integration with standard instruction set definitions (RISC-V, custom educational ISA)
  - Logging system for detailed analysis of execution flow

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must prioritize clarity and educational value over performance
  - Implementation must be transparent and well-documented for educational purposes
  - All internal states must be observable and explainable
  - Must not require specialized hardware to run

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
1. **Stack-based Virtual Machine**: Implement a complete stack-based virtual machine with a well-defined instruction set, featuring clear separation between fetch, decode, and execute phases that can be visualized and inspected.

2. **Pipeline Implementation**: Create a pipeline architecture that models realistic CPU stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back) with visibility into stalls, hazards, and forwarding.

3. **Execution Tracing**: Provide comprehensive execution tracing with cycle-accurate timing information, recording the state of each pipeline stage at each clock cycle.

4. **Microarchitecture Modeling**: Implement the decomposition of complex instructions into micro-operations, showing how each high-level instruction maps to fundamental operations.

5. **Architecture Customization**: Develop a configuration system for modifying key architectural elements, including instruction set definitions, pipeline depth, memory hierarchy, and timing parameters.

6. **Annotation System**: Create an annotation mechanism that allows attaching explanatory notes to specific instructions, pipeline stages, or execution events for educational purposes.

7. **Memory Hierarchy**: Implement a configurable memory system with multiple levels (registers, cache, main memory) and visualizable access patterns and timing effects.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct execution of all instructions in the instruction set
  - Accurate pipeline visualization with proper stage progression
  - Precise cycle counting and timing model accuracy
  - Correct implementation of pipeline hazard detection and resolution
  - Functional architecture customization and configuration loading

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Executing example programs that demonstrate key computer architecture concepts
  - Modifying the architecture configuration to compare different design approaches
  - Tracing the execution of programs with complex control flow and data dependencies
  - Annotating execution for classroom demonstrations
  - Analyzing performance characteristics of different instruction sequences

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Execute a standard test program in under 100ms (excluding visualization generation)
  - Generate pipeline visualization with less than 50ms of additional overhead per instruction
  - Support at least 10 simultaneous pipeline stage visualizations
  - Load architecture configurations in under 500ms

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handle invalid instructions gracefully with clear error messages
  - Manage pipeline hazards correctly, including data dependencies and control hazards
  - Recover from illegal memory accesses with appropriate exception handling
  - Provide clear diagnostics for misconfigurations of the architecture
  - Handle extremely long-running programs without performance degradation

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for the core execution engine
  - 100% coverage of the instruction set implementation
  - 90% coverage for the pipeline and hazard detection logic
  - 90% coverage for the architecture configuration system

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
1. Computer architecture students can observe and understand the complete instruction lifecycle through the pipeline.
2. Performance impacts of different instruction sequences are clearly measurable and analyzable.
3. The microarchitecture simulation accurately demonstrates how complex instructions decompose into simpler operations.
4. Architecture configurations can be easily modified to demonstrate different design tradeoffs.
5. The annotation system effectively highlights important concepts during classroom demonstrations.
6. Programs written for the virtual machine execute correctly and with predictable timing.
7. Students can correlate theoretical concepts from lectures with observed behavior in the emulator.
