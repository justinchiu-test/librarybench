# Educational Pipeline-Visualizing Virtual Machine

## Overview
An educational stack-based virtual machine implementation designed specifically for computer architecture education, featuring detailed pipeline visualization, microarchitecture simulation, and customizable components that clearly demonstrate fundamental CPU concepts without the complexity of modern processor designs.

## Persona Description
Dr. Rodriguez teaches undergraduate computer architecture courses and needs to help students understand CPU operation principles without the complexity of modern processor designs. She wants a transparent virtual machine that clearly demonstrates fundamental concepts like fetch-decode-execute cycles and memory management.

## Key Requirements

1. **Pipeline Visualization System**
   - Implementation of a detailed visualization system showing each instruction passing through fetch-decode-execute stages
   - Critical for Dr. Rodriguez as it makes abstract pipeline concepts tangible for students and shows exactly how instructions flow through the CPU stages, visually exposing concepts like pipeline stalls and forwarding
   - Must provide a programmatic interface that education tools can consume to render the pipeline state

2. **Microarchitecture Simulation**
   - System for revealing how high-level instructions decompose into micro-operations
   - Essential because it helps students understand that even simple assembly instructions often translate to multiple low-level operations in modern CPUs, bridging the gap between ISA and hardware implementation
   - Must model control signals and data paths between microarchitectural components

3. **Cycle-Accurate Timing Model**
   - Implementation of precise cycle-counting mechanisms demonstrating performance impacts of different instruction sequences
   - Critical for teaching performance optimization concepts and demonstrating how different code patterns affect execution speed, helping students understand concepts like instruction latency and throughput
   - Must accurately model branch prediction, cache effects, and other timing-relevant CPU features

4. **Customizable Architecture Framework**
   - Systems allowing modification of instruction set and memory model for comparison
   - Important for demonstrating architectural tradeoffs between different design decisions and allowing students to experiment with creating their own instruction sets to understand design principles
   - Must provide interfaces for defining new instructions and memory models programmatically

5. **Annotation System for Instruction Analysis**
   - Implementation of annotation capabilities for highlighting specific concepts during classroom demonstrations
   - Necessary for effective teaching as it allows Dr. Rodriguez to emphasize particular aspects of execution during lectures and create reusable, annotated demonstrations of important concepts
   - Must support attaching metadata to instructions, memory regions, and pipeline stages

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests covering normal operation and edge cases
- Pipeline states must be serializable and comparable to enable verification of correct execution paths
- Microarchitecture execution must be deterministic and reproducible for consistent test results
- Performance timing model must be verifiable against theoretical cycle counts
- Architecture modifications must be testable with parameterized test fixtures

### Performance Expectations
- The simulation must execute basic programs in near real-time to maintain student engagement during demonstrations
- Pipeline visualization data must be generated with minimal overhead (<5% of execution time)
- Must efficiently handle programs of at least 1000 instructions without significant slowdown
- Architecture customization should not require VM recompilationâ€”runtime reconfiguration is expected
- Should be optimized to run well on standard education lab hardware configurations

### Integration Points
- Must provide clean Python APIs for all core functionality to enable integration with other educational tools
- Should export pipeline state data in a structured format (JSON/YAML) for external visualization tools
- Should offer hooks for curriculum integration that allow programmatic control of execution and visualization
- Must include logging interfaces for capturing execution data for later analysis
- Should provide serialization/deserialization of machine state for saving and restoring demonstration points

### Key Constraints
- Must strictly adhere to an educational focus, prioritizing clarity over performance
- Cannot use external dependencies beyond the Python standard library to ensure portability in educational environments
- Implementation must maintain clear separation between the core VM and visualization components
- Code organization must reflect the actual CPU architecture to reinforce learning
- Memory footprint must remain reasonable to allow concurrent use in lab environments

## Core Functionality

The Educational Pipeline-Visualizing Virtual Machine must implement:

1. A stack-based virtual machine with a simple yet comprehensive instruction set that includes:
   - Basic arithmetic and logical operations
   - Memory access operations (load, store)
   - Control flow operations (jumps, conditionals)
   - Stack manipulation operations

2. A detailed pipeline implementation that:
   - Models a classic 5-stage RISC pipeline (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback)
   - Handles pipeline hazards (structural, data, control)
   - Provides methods to extract the state of each stage during execution
   - Demonstrates concepts like forwarding and stalling

3. A microarchitecture simulation system that:
   - Decomposes each instruction into micro-operations
   - Tracks data movement between registers, ALU, and memory
   - Models control signals that orchestrate execution
   - Represents the hardware elements involved in instruction execution

4. A cycle-accurate timing model that:
   - Counts clock cycles for each instruction based on microarchitecture
   - Models pipelining effects on throughput
   - Accounts for hazards and their performance impact
   - Provides statistics on cycle count breakdown

5. A customizable architecture framework that:
   - Allows modification of the instruction set
   - Supports different memory addressing modes
   - Enables adjustment of pipeline characteristics
   - Facilitates comparison between architectural choices

6. An annotation system that:
   - Attaches metadata to instructions and memory locations
