# Programming Language Target Virtual Machine

## Overview
A well-documented virtual machine implementation designed as a target platform for student-created programming languages, providing visualization of intermediate code transformations, optimization frameworks, and performance analysis tools to support compiler backend design.

## Persona Description
Miguel is creating his own programming language as a capstone project and needs a target virtual machine to generate code for. He requires a well-documented runtime that helps him understand compiler backend design and code generation strategies.

## Key Requirements
1. **Intermediate representation visualization showing the transformation from high-level code to bytecode**: Essential for Miguel to understand and debug the compilation process, allowing him to trace how source language constructs are translated into executable instructions and identify potential improvements in his code generation strategies.

2. **Optimization framework for implementing and testing various code improvement techniques**: Critical for Miguel to experiment with different optimization strategies like constant folding, dead code elimination, or register allocation, allowing him to improve the performance of his generated code and understand the tradeoffs of different approaches.

3. **Custom instruction extension mechanism for adding language-specific operations**: Enables Miguel to extend the virtual machine with specialized instructions that directly support unique features of his programming language, improving performance and expressiveness without having to implement complex operations using basic primitives.

4. **Symbol table management for implementing variable scoping and name resolution**: Provides infrastructure for tracking variables, functions, and types, crucial for language features like closures, namespaces, or object-oriented programming, helping Miguel implement proper scoping rules in his language.

5. **Runtime performance metrics identifying bottlenecks in generated code**: Allows Miguel to analyze the efficiency of his compiler's output, pinpointing slow operations or suboptimal code generation patterns so he can iteratively improve his compiler implementation based on real performance data.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All VM components must have comprehensive unit tests 
  - Tests must verify correct execution of both standard and custom instructions
  - Code optimization transformations must be independently testable
  - Symbol table operations must be verifiable through automated tests
  - Performance metrics collection should be testable without affecting execution

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - VM should execute simple programs at a rate of at least 100,000 instructions per second
  - Symbol table operations should have O(1) complexity for common lookups
  - Optimization passes should complete in under 1 second for programs up to 10,000 instructions
  - IR visualization generation should not significantly impact performance
  - Memory footprint should remain stable during extended execution sessions

- **Integration Points**:
  - Clean API for programmatically emitting bytecode and custom instructions
  - Standardized format for intermediate representation data
  - Hooks for optimization passes to transform code
  - External metrics collection interface
  - Serialization/deserialization of program state and symbol information

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must be implementable using only Python standard library
  - All operations must be deterministic and reproducible
  - Implementation must be educational and well-documented rather than focused on maximum performance
  - Must support mainstream programming paradigms (imperative, functional, object-oriented)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
1. **Virtual Machine Engine**: Implement a stack-based virtual machine with a comprehensive instruction set capable of efficiently executing compiled programs, with clear internal state representation and execution model.

2. **Intermediate Representation System**: Create a well-defined intermediate representation format that bridges high-level language constructs and low-level bytecode, with APIs for inspection, transformation, and visualization.

3. **Optimization Framework**: Provide a pluggable system for implementing and applying code transformations, with before/after comparison capabilities and performance impact measurements.

4. **Symbol Management**: Implement comprehensive symbol table functionality supporting nested scopes, type information, visibility rules, and efficient lookup operations for supporting language semantics.

5. **Instruction Extension**: Create a flexible mechanism for defining and registering custom instruction handlers, including validation, documentation, and integration with the core VM.

6. **Performance Analysis**: Implement instrumentation for collecting detailed metrics on instruction execution frequency, timing, memory usage, and call patterns to identify optimization opportunities.

7. **Bytecode Serialization**: Provide facilities for saving and loading compiled programs, including associated symbol information and debugging metadata.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct execution of all standard VM instructions
  - Proper implementation of custom instruction extensions
  - Accurate intermediate representation transformations
  - Effective application of optimization techniques
  - Precise symbol table management across nested scopes
  - Reliable performance metrics collection

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Compiling and executing programs with various language constructs
  - Extending the VM with custom instructions for language-specific features
  - Applying and measuring the impact of different optimization strategies
  - Analyzing execution performance to identify bottlenecks
  - Managing symbol information across complex program structures

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Execute standard test programs at rates exceeding 100,000 instructions per second
  - Compile test programs to IR in under 100ms
  - Apply standard optimization passes in under 500ms for moderate-sized programs
  - Symbol table operations should complete in under 10Î¼s per operation
  - Memory usage should not exceed 100MB for standard test cases

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handle invalid bytecode sequences with clear error reporting
  - Manage stack overflow/underflow conditions appropriately
  - Properly detect and report type mismatches or invalid operations
  - Handle circular references in symbol resolution
  - Recover gracefully from optimization errors without corrupting program state

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of the core instruction set
  - 95% coverage of the optimization framework
  - 90% coverage of custom instruction extension mechanisms
  - 95% coverage of symbol table management functionality
  - 90% coverage of performance metrics collection

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

2. The intermediate representation visualization clearly shows the transformation process
3. At least three optimization techniques can be implemented and measured for performance impact
4. Custom instructions can be defined to efficiently support language-specific features
5. Symbol table management correctly handles complex scoping rules and name resolution
6. Performance metrics accurately identify execution bottlenecks in generated code
7. The system is well-documented enough that Miguel can understand all aspects of the virtual machine's operation

To set up your environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
