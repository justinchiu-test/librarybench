# Historical Computer Architecture Emulator

## Overview
A highly configurable virtual machine framework designed to accurately emulate historical computer architectures, capturing the unique characteristics, limitations, and quirks of vintage computing systems for both educational and preservation purposes.

## Persona Description
Marcus has a passion for historical computing systems and wants to understand and recreate vintage computer architectures. He needs a flexible emulator framework that can be configured to match the behavior of classic machines.

## Key Requirements
1. **Historical architecture modeling with period-accurate limitations and quirks**: Essential for Marcus to create authentic emulations of vintage computers, faithfully reproducing peculiarities like the 6502's zero page addressing or the PDP-11's octal orientation, ensuring historically accurate behavior rather than idealized implementations.

2. **Vintage programming environment emulating historical development tools**: Critical for experiencing the full historical context of early computing, allowing Marcus to write code using period-appropriate assemblers, compilers, and development paradigms to understand the constraints and techniques of the era.

3. **Cycle-accurate timing reproducing the exact behavior of original hardware**: Vital for perfect emulation of timing-sensitive operations like video generation or sound synthesis, ensuring that programs dependent on precise cycle counts (common in demo scene productions or games) behave exactly as they would on original hardware.

4. **Visual representation of blinkenlights and front panel interfaces**: Important for recreating the tangible, physical elements of historical computers, allowing Marcus to observe the iconic front panel displays of machines like the PDP-8 or Altair 8800 that provided visual feedback about system state and memory contents.

5. **Media conversion tools for working with historical file and storage formats**: Necessary for interacting with archived software and data, providing capabilities to work with formats like paper tape, punch cards, magnetic tape, or obsolete disk formats, making historical software accessible in the emulated environment.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All emulated CPU instructions must be individually testable against known correct behavior
  - Timing-dependent operations must be verifiable down to the cycle level
  - Historical quirks and bugs must be reproducible and testable
  - Media format conversions must be validated against reference implementations
  - Front panel operations must be testable through programmatic interfaces

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Cycle-accurate mode should run at least 10% of original speed on modern hardware
  - Support for accelerated mode running 100x original speed for non-timing-critical operations
  - Debugger operations should not affect timing in observation mode
  - Media conversion operations should complete within reasonable timeframes (<10s)
  - Front panel visualization should update at visually appropriate rates (minimum 24Hz)

- **Integration Points**:
  - Architecture definition framework for specifying different historical CPUs
  - Memory and I/O system configuration interface
  - Historical media format importers and exporters
  - Debugging and monitoring hooks
  - Peripheral device simulation API

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must prioritize historical accuracy over performance
  - Should support multiple historically significant architectures
  - Must include proper documentation of architectural peculiarities
  - Should be extensible to accommodate additional historical systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
1. **Configurable CPU Emulation**: Implement a framework for defining and emulating different historical CPU architectures with their unique instruction sets, addressing modes, and timing characteristics.

2. **Historical Memory Systems**: Create accurate models of vintage memory architectures, including limitations, banking schemes, read/write timing, and special-purpose memory regions.

3. **Cycle-Exact Timing**: Provide precise cycle counting and timing for all operations, ensuring that instruction execution, memory access, and I/O operations take exactly the correct number of cycles.

4. **Front Panel Simulation**: Implement a system for representing the front panel interfaces of historical computers, including switches, lights, and display elements with accurate behavior.

5. **Period-Appropriate Development Tools**: Create emulations of historical programming environments, assemblers, and basic compilers that match the capabilities and limitations of the era.

6. **Media Format Handling**: Develop tools for reading, writing, and converting historical media formats, allowing interchange between modern storage and emulated vintage formats.

7. **Hardware Peculiarity Simulation**: Accurately reproduce the unique behaviors, bugs, and undocumented features of historical systems that software often relied upon.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct implementation of all CPU instructions for each emulated architecture
  - Accurate cycle counting for all operations
  - Proper emulation of documented and undocumented hardware behaviors
  - Correct operation of front panel controls and displays
  - Accurate conversion of media formats

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Running well-known historical software with correct behavior
  - Programming using period-appropriate development tools
  - Debugging programs using front panel controls
  - Converting between modern and historical media formats
  - Exploring and understanding architectural peculiarities

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Execute standard test programs with cycle-perfect accuracy
  - Support emulation of systems with clock speeds up to 10MHz with cycle accuracy
  - Handle systems with up to 64KB of addressable memory (standard for 8-bit era)
  - Process at least 1MB of media conversion per second
  - Update front panel displays at minimum 24Hz

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handle undocumented opcodes and CPU behaviors correctly
  - Properly simulate hardware failures common to the era
  - Manage invalid front panel operations appropriately
  - Handle corrupted or non-standard media formats gracefully
  - Properly detect and report configuration inconsistencies

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of all CPU instruction implementations
  - 95% coverage of timing-sensitive operations
  - 90% coverage of front panel simulation
  - 95% coverage of media format conversion
  - 90% coverage of peripheral device emulation

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

1. Successfully runs period-appropriate software with behavior indistinguishable from original hardware
2. Accurately reproduces cycle-exact timing required for timing-sensitive operations
3. Correctly implements historically accurate quirks and limitations of original architectures
4. Provides authentic reproduction of front panel operations for appropriate systems
