# Historical Computing Systems Emulator

## Overview
A specialized virtual machine framework designed to accurately recreate vintage computer architectures, allowing retrocomputing enthusiasts to explore, understand, and interact with historical computing systems through faithful emulation of their unique characteristics, limitations, and programming environments.

## Persona Description
Marcus has a passion for historical computing systems and wants to understand and recreate vintage computer architectures. He needs a flexible emulator framework that can be configured to match the behavior of classic machines.

## Key Requirements
1. **Historical Architecture Modeling**: Implement a configurable system capable of accurately modeling period-specific CPU architectures with their unique limitations, instruction sets, and quirks. This feature is critical for Marcus to authentically experience the constraints and design decisions that shaped early computing, providing insight into how historical machines actually operated and why certain programming techniques evolved.

2. **Vintage Programming Environment**: Create a simulation of historical development tools, including assemblers, monitors, and primitive debugging capabilities from different computing eras. This capability allows Marcus to experience the authentic workflow of early programmers, understanding how software was developed without modern tools and how programming methodologies evolved in response to these constraints.

3. **Cycle-Accurate Timing**: Develop precise timing simulations that reproduce the exact behavior and performance characteristics of original hardware down to the clock cycle. This accuracy is essential for Marcus to explore timing-dependent code, understand performance bottlenecks in historical systems, and appreciate how programmers optimized within specific hardware limitations.

4. **Visual Panel Interfaces**: Design representations of blinkenlights, front panel switches, and vintage display technologies that mirror the physical interfaces of historical computers. These visualizations help Marcus comprehend how early computer operators interacted with machines before monitors became standard, providing insight into the physical nature of early computing.

5. **Media Conversion Tools**: Implement utilities for working with historical file formats, storage media representations, and data encoding schemes from different computing eras. This tooling is vital for Marcus to work with authentic software artifacts, study historical data storage approaches, and preserve vintage programs in their original formats.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All architecture components must be independently testable
  - Instruction execution must be deterministic and reproducible
  - Timing simulations must be verifiable against historical documentation
  - Media conversion operations must be reversible for validation
  - System behavior must match documented quirks of original hardware
  
- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Modern systems should emulate vintage hardware at speeds at least 10x faster than original
  - Cycle-accurate mode must maintain exact timing ratios between operations
  - Media conversion tools should process vintage formats in seconds regardless of original speed
  - Configuration changes should apply without requiring system rebuilding
  - Complete machine state must be serializable and deserializable for testing

- **Integration Points**:
  - Standard interface for loading period-appropriate software
  - Export formats for machine state and execution traces
  - Compatible storage format for vintage media images
  - Conversion utilities for modern-to-vintage data translation
  - Extension mechanism for adding new architecture definitions

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in pure Python for portability and accessibility
  - No dependencies beyond standard library to ensure easy deployment
  - Architecture definitions must be data-driven rather than hard-coded
  - All behaviors should be documented with historical references
  - System must be usable without knowledge of original hardware

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

4. Cycle-accurate timing simulations for instruction execution and I/O operations

5. Data structures representing front panel controls, switches, and indicators

6. Vintage development tool simulations including assemblers and monitors

7. Historical media format handling for various storage types and encoding schemes

8. Configuration system for defining different machine architectures from historical specifications

9. State serialization for saving and restoring complete machine state

  - Proper emulation of known hardware bugs and limitations
  - Correct behavior with edge case inputs that would challenge original hardware
  - Appropriate responses to operations that would damage physical machines
  - Graceful handling of incomplete or ambiguous historical documentation

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:

  - 100% coverage for instruction set implementations
  - At least 95% branch coverage for timing-sensitive code
  - Complete coverage of media conversion utilities
  - At least 85% coverage for vintage development tool simulations

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

1. Accurately recreates the behavior of at least three distinct historical computing architectures

2. Provides cycle-accurate timing that matches documented specifications

3. Successfully runs period-appropriate software with correct results

4. Includes authentic simulations of vintage development environments

5. Properly handles historical media formats and conversion between modern formats

6. Represents front panel interfaces and indicators for appropriate machine types

7. Correctly implements documented quirks and limitations of historical systems

8. Provides extensibility for adding new machine definitions

9. Enables exploration of architectural differences between vintage systems

10. Successfully passes all test cases demonstrating the required functionality

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest

## Environment Setup
To set up the development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. CRITICAL: For test execution and reporting:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion. This file must be included as proof that all tests pass successfully.
