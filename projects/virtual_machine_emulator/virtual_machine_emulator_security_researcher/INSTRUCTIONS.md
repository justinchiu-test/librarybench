# Security Vulnerability Demonstration Virtual Machine

## Overview
A specialized virtual machine designed to safely demonstrate and analyze low-level security vulnerabilities, providing controlled environments for memory corruption, code injection, access control, and other attack vectors without real-world consequences.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen studies low-level security vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques. He needs a controlled environment to demonstrate memory corruption, code injection, and other attack vectors without real-world consequences.

## Key Requirements
1. **Memory protection simulation with configurable enforcement**: Critical for Dr. Chen to demonstrate how memory protection mechanisms work and how they can be bypassed under certain conditions, allowing him to show both the importance of these protections and their potential weaknesses in a controlled environment.

2. **Exploitation playground for safely demonstrating buffer overflows and code injection**: Essential for teaching and researching common attack vectors without risking actual systems, enabling Dr. Chen to develop and test proof-of-concept exploits that illustrate vulnerability patterns while containing their effects within the virtual environment.

3. **Permission and privilege level modeling to illustrate access control mechanisms**: Necessary for showing how privilege escalation attacks work and how proper access controls can prevent them, allowing demonstration of how attackers can move from limited to elevated privileges by exploiting weaknesses in permission systems.

4. **Control flow integrity visualization showing normal and compromised execution paths**: Vital for illustrating how attacks like return-oriented programming alter a program's intended execution flow, making abstract concepts tangible by visually contrasting normal control flow with malicious redirections caused by exploits.

5. **Isolation breach detection identifying when virtualization boundaries are compromised**: Important for researching advanced attacks that attempt to escape sandboxed environments, helping Dr. Chen understand and demonstrate techniques that might compromise isolation between virtualized components or between the virtual machine and the host.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All security mechanisms must be individually testable for both correct operation and expected failure modes
  - Exploitation techniques must be reproducible with deterministic outcomes
  - Memory corruption scenarios must be precisely controllable and measurable
  - Control flow integrity checks must verify both valid and invalid execution paths
  - Isolation mechanisms must be testable for effectiveness against known escape vectors

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Must execute standard test exploits without significant performance degradation
  - Memory protection checks should add minimal overhead to normal execution
  - Should support detailed instruction-level tracing with less than 10x execution slowdown
  - Must handle programs with at least 100,000 instructions for realistic vulnerability demonstration
  - Control flow visualization must remain responsive during exploit execution

- **Integration Points**:
  - Exploit definition API for creating reproducible security scenarios
  - Memory layout and protection configuration interface
  - Hooks for security monitoring and breach detection
  - Inspection API for analyzing system state during exploit attempts
  - Export mechanism for analysis results and execution traces

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must contain all exploit effects within the virtual environment
  - Should never risk the security of the host system
  - Must accurately represent real-world security mechanisms and vulnerabilities
  - Should be usable for both educational demonstrations and serious security research

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
1. **Memory Protection System**: Implement a configurable memory protection mechanism supporting read/write/execute permissions, address space layout randomization, stack canaries, and non-executable memory regions.

2. **Exploitation Framework**: Create a framework for defining, executing, and analyzing different types of security exploits, including buffer overflows, format string attacks, use-after-free scenarios, and return-oriented programming.

3. **Privilege Management**: Implement a multi-level privilege system with clear boundaries between execution contexts, controlled transition mechanisms, and proper validation of cross-privilege operations.

4. **Control Flow Monitoring**: Provide detailed tracking and visualization of program execution paths, highlighting deviations from expected control flow and identifying gadget chains in return-oriented programming attacks.

5. **Isolation Enforcement**: Create a strong isolation architecture between different components of the virtual machine, with monitoring for potential escape attempts and boundary violations.

6. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Implement tools for analyzing and categorizing observed vulnerabilities, tracking exploitation methods, and measuring the effectiveness of different protection mechanisms.

7. **State Inspection**: Provide comprehensive inspection capabilities for examining memory contents, register values, stack state, and execution history before, during, and after exploitation attempts.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct implementation of memory protection mechanisms
  - Successful demonstration of common exploitation techniques
  - Proper enforcement of privilege boundaries and access controls
  - Accurate detection of control flow integrity violations
  - Reliable containment of all exploit effects within the virtual environment

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Demonstrating a buffer overflow attack with and without various protections
  - Showing privilege escalation through confused deputy problems
  - Illustrating return-oriented programming techniques
  - Analyzing format string vulnerability exploitation
  - Testing the effectiveness of different memory protection configurations

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Execute standard test programs at normal speed with protection mechanisms disabled
  - Limited overhead (less than 2x slowdown) with basic protection mechanisms enabled
  - Support detailed tracing with acceptable performance degradation (less than 10x)
  - Handle at least 100MB of virtual memory with protection checks
  - Process security violation events within 10ms for responsive feedback

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handle extremely large buffer overflow attempts without crashing the emulator
  - Properly contain exploits that attempt to corrupt the VM's own state
  - Detect and report attempted isolation breaches with clear diagnostics
  - Manage malformed instructions and deliberate CPU state corruption
  - Recover from intentional resource exhaustion attacks

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of all memory protection implementations
  - 95% coverage of privilege enforcement mechanisms
  - 90% coverage of control flow integrity monitoring
  - 95% coverage of isolation boundary enforcement
  - 90% coverage of the exploitation framework

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully demonstrates common memory corruption vulnerabilities with predictable, controlled outcomes
2. Clearly illustrates the effectiveness of different protection mechanisms against specific attack vectors
3. Provides accurate visualization of control flow during both normal execution and exploit attempts
4. Maintains complete isolation of exploit effects within the virtual environment
5. Offers detailed analysis of the exploitation process for educational and research purposes
6. Supports development and testing of novel protection mechanisms
7. Generates reproducible results that can be used in security research publications

To set up your environment, use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment. From within the project directory, the environment can be activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
