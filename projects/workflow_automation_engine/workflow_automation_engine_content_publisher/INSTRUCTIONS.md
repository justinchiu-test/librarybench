# Content Publishing Workflow Automation Engine

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for content publishers, enabling automated content transformation across formats, structured approval workflows, coordinated multi-channel publishing, comprehensive asset management, and sophisticated localization processing. This system provides reliable automation for complex content publishing operations while ensuring consistency and quality across platforms.

## Persona Description
Amara manages digital content publication across multiple platforms and formats. She needs workflow automation to streamline content transformation, approval processes, and coordinated publishing.

## Key Requirements
1. **Content Transformation**: Implement automatic conversion between different formats and platforms. This feature is critical for Amara because her team creates content that must appear consistently across websites, mobile apps, social media, and print materials, and manual reformatting is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.

2. **Approval Workflow Implementation**: Create role-based review steps and notifications. Amara requires this capability because her organization has strict content governance requiring multiple stakeholders (editorial, legal, brand) to review and approve content before publication, and tracking these approvals manually leads to bottlenecks and missed steps.

3. **Publishing Schedule Coordination**: Develop timing releases across different channels. This feature is vital for Amara as her content strategy requires synchronized publication across channels for maximum impact, with precise timing often needed for promotional campaigns, product launches, and coordinated announcements.

4. **Asset Management**: Build proper organization and referencing of all associated files. Amara needs this functionality because her content includes numerous digital assets (images, videos, documents) that must be properly versioned, transformed for different platforms, and consistently referenced across multiple content pieces.

5. **Localization Workflow**: Implement handling of translations and regional content variations. This capability is essential for Amara because her organization publishes globally, requiring content to be accurately translated, culturally adapted, and appropriately formatted for different regions while maintaining content governance and synchronization.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Content transformation must be testable with diverse content types and formats
  - Approval workflows must be verifiable with simulated multi-role review processes
  - Publishing coordination must be testable with complex scheduling scenarios
  - Asset management must be testable with mock digital asset collections
  - Localization workflows must be verifiable with simulated translation processes

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Content transformation should process standard articles in under 5 seconds
  - Approval workflow should support at least 20 concurrent review processes
  - Publishing coordination should handle at least 100 scheduled releases
  - Asset management should efficiently handle collections of 10,000+ assets
  - Localization workflow should support at least 10 languages with region-specific variations

- **Integration Points**:
  - Content management systems (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)
  - Digital asset management systems
  - Social media platforms
  - Email marketing systems
  - Translation management services
  - Website publishing systems
  - Mobile app content APIs
  - Print publication workflows

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All functionality must be implemented as libraries and APIs, not as applications with UIs
  - Must handle large media files efficiently
  - Must maintain content version history and audit trails
  - Must respect platform-specific content restrictions and formats
  - Must operate with appropriate security controls for pre-release content
  - Should support both batch and real-time publishing workflows

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this Content Publishing Workflow Automation Engine centers around efficient content management and distribution:

1. **Workflow Definition System**: A Python API and YAML/JSON parser for defining content publishing workflows with transformation steps, approval sequences, scheduling directives, and localization processes.

2. **Content Transformation Framework**: Components that convert content between various formats (HTML, Markdown, social media formats, print layouts) while preserving semantic structure, styling, and asset references.

3. **Approval Process Engine**: Modules that manage multi-stage, role-based review workflows with appropriate state tracking, notifications, and audit trails.

4. **Publication Scheduler**: A system for defining, managing, and executing precisely timed content releases across multiple channels with dependencies and coordination.

5. **Asset Manager**: Components for tracking, transforming, and delivering digital assets across publishing channels with proper versioning and reference management.

6. **Localization Coordinator**: Modules that manage the translation and cultural adaptation of content, including text, assets, and metadata, while maintaining synchronization with source material.

7. **Execution Engine**: The core orchestrator that manages workflow execution, handles dependencies between steps, and coordinates the various components while maintaining workflow state.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accurate content transformation across multiple formats
  - Proper implementation of multi-stage approval processes
  - Precise timing coordination for multi-channel publishing
  - Comprehensive asset tracking and reference management
  - Effective localization workflow with content synchronization

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - End-to-end content lifecycle from creation through approval to multi-channel publication
  - Complex approval workflow with conditional review paths based on content attributes
  - Coordinated product launch with synchronized content across platforms
  - Asset usage tracking across multiple content pieces
  - Multi-language publication with region-specific variations
  - Content update propagation across published instances

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Content transformation in under 5 seconds for standard articles
  - Support for 20+ concurrent approval workflows
  - Management of 100+ scheduled content releases
  - Efficient handling of 10,000+ digital assets
  - Support for 10+ language variations with region-specific content

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Content with complex formatting and embedded media
  - Approval process exceptions and escalations
  - Last-minute publishing schedule changes
  - Missing or corrupt digital assets
  - Partial translation availability
  - Platform-specific publishing failures
  - Content size exceeding platform limits
  - Version conflicts during concurrent editing
  - Regulatory compliance issues in specific regions

- **Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all core modules
  - 100% coverage for content transformation logic
  - 100% coverage for approval workflow state transitions
  - 100% coverage for publishing schedule coordination
  - All error handling paths must be tested

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
