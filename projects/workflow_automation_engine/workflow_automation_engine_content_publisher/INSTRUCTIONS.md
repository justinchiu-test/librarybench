# Content Publication Orchestration System

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for content publishers to streamline digital content publication across multiple platforms and formats. This system enables sophisticated content transformation, structured approval processes, coordinated publishing schedules, and comprehensive asset management.

## Persona Description
Amara manages digital content publication across multiple platforms and formats. She needs workflow automation to streamline content transformation, approval processes, and coordinated publishing.

## Key Requirements

1. **Content Transformation**
   - Automatically convert between different formats and platforms
   - Critical for Amara to efficiently prepare content for various publishing channels without manual reformatting
   - Must include format conversion, responsive adaptation, metadata extraction, and platform-specific optimization

2. **Approval Workflow Implementation**
   - Implement role-based review steps and notifications
   - Essential for Amara to ensure content meets quality standards and organizational guidelines
   - Must support reviewer assignment, sequential and parallel reviews, feedback collection, and approval tracking

3. **Publishing Schedule Coordination**
   - Time releases across different channels
   - Vital for Amara to execute coordinated content strategies across platforms
   - Must include schedule management, release timing optimization, dependency handling, and embargo support

4. **Asset Management**
   - Ensure all associated files are properly organized and referenced
   - Important for Amara to maintain consistency and prevent broken references
   - Must include asset tracking, relationship management, usage analysis, and reference integrity checking

5. **Localization Workflow**
   - Handle translations and regional content variations
   - Critical for Amara to efficiently manage multi-language content across markets
   - Must support translation process management, regional adaptation, consistency verification, and variant synchronization

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Content transformation must be verifiable with standard content types
- Approval workflows must be testable with simulated reviewer interactions
- Scheduling must be verifiable with mocked time systems
- Asset relationships must be testable with predefined content structures
- Localization processes must be verifiable with multi-language test content

### Performance Expectations
- Transform standard content types in under 30 seconds per format
- Process approval workflows with at least 10 steps without performance degradation
- Handle scheduling coordination for at least 100 simultaneous campaigns
- Manage relationship tracking for at least 10,000 interconnected assets
- Support at least 20 different localization targets per content piece

### Integration Points
- Content management systems (WordPress, Drupal, custom CMSes)
- Digital asset management systems
- Social media platforms and scheduling tools
- Email marketing systems
- Analytics platforms for content performance tracking

### Key Constraints
- Must work with existing content repositories and structures
- Must maintain content integrity during transformations
- Must preserve metadata across publishing channels
- Must operate within organizational permission boundaries
- Must respect platform-specific publishing limitations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Content Publication Orchestration System should provide:

1. **Content Transformation Engine**
   - Format conversion library
   - Template-based rendering
   - Platform-specific optimization
   - Metadata management
   
2. **Approval System**
   - Workflow definition framework
   - Reviewer assignment and notification
   - Feedback collection and management
   - Status tracking and reporting
   
3. **Publication Scheduling Framework**
   - Calendar and timing management
   - Cross-channel coordination
   - Dependency resolution
   - Embargo and timed release management
   
4. **Asset Relationship Management**
   - Asset indexing and cataloging
   - Reference tracking and validation
   - Usage analysis and reporting
   - Orphaned asset detection
   
5. **Localization Management System**
   - Translation process orchestration
   - Regional variant tracking
   - Consistency verification
   - Synchronized updates across variants

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Content transformation correctly converts between formats while preserving intent
- Approval workflows properly route content through review processes
- Publication scheduling correctly times releases across platforms
- Asset management accurately tracks relationships between content elements
- Localization workflows handle translations and variants appropriately

### Critical User Scenarios
- Publishing a complex content piece across multiple platforms with format-specific adaptations
- Routing content through multi-stage approval with various stakeholders
- Coordinating a global content release across time zones and platforms
- Managing a content update that affects multiple interconnected assets
- Publishing content in multiple languages with region-specific adaptations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Transform a 20-page document to 5 different formats in under 2 minutes
- Complete a 5-step approval process with notifications in under 1 minute
- Generate optimized schedules for 50 content pieces across 10 platforms in under 30 seconds
- Analyze and validate relationships for 1,000 assets in under 1 minute
- Process localization variants for 10 languages for a standard content piece in under 3 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling unsupported content formats or elements
- Managing rejected content and approval rollbacks
- Dealing with scheduling conflicts and priority resolution
- Resolving broken references and missing assets
- Handling translation discrepancies and regional restrictions
- Responding to platform API changes or publishing failures

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for content transformation logic
- All approval workflow paths must have dedicated test cases
- All scheduling algorithms must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end publishing flows with simulated platforms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It enables efficient transformation of content between different formats and platforms
2. It correctly implements structured approval workflows with appropriate notifications
3. It effectively coordinates publication timing across multiple channels
4. It reliably manages relationships between content assets to maintain integrity
5. It properly handles localization with consistent translations and regional adaptations
