# Data Pipeline Workflow Automation Engine

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for data engineers, enabling the orchestration of complex data processing pipelines with robust data quality validation, incremental processing capabilities, comprehensive lineage tracking, and optimized storage management. This system provides reliable automation for multi-stage data transformations while ensuring data integrity and compliance.

## Persona Description
Priya processes data from multiple sources through complex transformation and validation pipelines. She needs reliable orchestration of data workflows with dependencies, error handling, and quality verification steps.

## Key Requirements
1. **Data Quality Gate Implementation**: Create an enforcement system for validation rules between processing stages. This feature is critical for Priya because data quality issues that propagate through the pipeline can lead to corrupted analytics, incorrect business decisions, and costly rework; catching quality issues early is essential for maintaining reliable data products.

2. **Incremental Processing Detection**: Develop a mechanism for avoiding redundant work on previously processed data. Priya requires this capability because her data pipelines process large volumes of information, and reprocessing unchanged data wastes computational resources, increases costs, and extends processing times unnecessarily.

3. **Data Lineage Tracking**: Implement comprehensive documentation of the full transformation history for compliance. This feature is vital for Priya as her organization needs to demonstrate regulatory compliance by showing exactly how data was transformed from raw sources to final outputs, facilitating audits and problem diagnosis.

4. **Processing Window Management**: Create a system for handling late-arriving data and temporal dependencies. Priya needs this functionality because real-world data often arrives late or out of sequence, and her pipelines must be able to incorporate late data appropriately without compromising the integrity of time-sensitive analytics.

5. **Storage Format Optimization**: Build automatic selection of appropriate compression and partitioning schemes. This capability is essential for Priya because optimized storage reduces costs, improves query performance, and enables more efficient data management across her organization's growing data ecosystem.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All data quality gate logic must be independently testable with synthetic data
  - Incremental processing detection must be verifiable with simulated data change patterns
  - Lineage tracking must be testable without requiring actual data transformations
  - Processing window management must be testable with synthetic temporal data patterns
  - Storage optimization decisions must be verifiable with different data volume scenarios

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Data quality validation should process at least 100,000 records per second on standard hardware
  - Incremental detection overhead should be less than 5% of total processing time
  - Lineage tracking should add no more than 3% overhead to processing operations
  - Late-arriving data handling should maintain throughput within 10% of normal processing
  - Storage optimization should reduce storage requirements by at least 30% compared to unoptimized formats

- **Integration Points**:
  - Data storage systems (S3, HDFS, cloud object storage)
  - Database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  - Stream processing platforms (Kafka, Kinesis)
  - Analytics engines (Spark, Pandas)
  - Metadata repositories for lineage tracking
  - Scheduler systems for workflow timing

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All functionality must be implemented as libraries and APIs, not as applications with UIs
  - System must operate efficiently with limited computational resources
  - Must support both batch and streaming data processing paradigms
  - Must handle datasets too large to fit in memory
  - All data access must respect defined security and privacy policies
  - Must operate in environments with potential network limitations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this Data Pipeline Workflow Automation Engine centers around reliable data transformation orchestration with quality assurance:

1. **Pipeline Definition System**: A Python API and YAML/JSON parser for defining multi-stage data processing workflows with validation rules, dependencies, and transformation logic.

2. **Data Quality Framework**: Components that implement and enforce data validation rules at each stage of processing, with configurable actions for handling quality violations.

3. **Incremental Processing Engine**: Modules that track data changes and intelligently process only new or modified data, maintaining state between pipeline runs.

4. **Lineage Tracking System**: A comprehensive metadata management system that records all transformations, sources, and processing steps for complete data provenance.

5. **Temporal Processing Manager**: Components for handling time-based windows, late-arriving data, and time-dependent aggregations with appropriate backfill capabilities.

6. **Storage Optimizer**: Modules that analyze data characteristics and automatically select optimal storage formats, compression, and partitioning strategies.

7. **Workflow Orchestrator**: The core engine that coordinates the execution of pipeline steps, manages dependencies, handles failures, and tracks overall processing state.

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
