# Data Pipeline Orchestration Engine

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for data engineers to orchestrate complex data transformation pipelines with sophisticated data quality controls, incremental processing capabilities, and comprehensive lineage tracking. This system enables reliable handling of data workflows with robust error management and quality verification at each stage.

## Persona Description
Priya processes data from multiple sources through complex transformation and validation pipelines. She needs reliable orchestration of data workflows with dependencies, error handling, and quality verification steps.

## Key Requirements

1. **Data Quality Gate Implementation**
   - Enforce validation rules between processing stages
   - Critical for Priya because data quality issues caught early prevent costly downstream errors and reprocessing
   - Must include configurable validation rules, threshold-based quality checks, and conditional workflow paths based on quality metrics

2. **Incremental Processing Detection**
   - Avoid redundant work on previously processed data
   - Essential for Priya to optimize pipeline performance and reduce processing costs on large datasets
   - Must track processed data boundaries, detect new/modified data, and selectively process only required records

3. **Data Lineage Tracking**
   - Document the full transformation history for compliance
   - Vital for Priya to meet regulatory requirements and support audit processes in data-sensitive industries
   - Must capture metadata about data sources, transformations applied, quality check results, and destination systems

4. **Processing Window Management**
   - Handle late-arriving data and temporal dependencies
   - Important for Priya when dealing with time-series data that may arrive out of sequence or after processing windows
   - Must support time-based windowing, late arrival policies, and reprocessing strategies

5. **Storage Format Optimization**
   - Automatically select appropriate compression and partitioning
   - Critical for Priya to optimize storage costs and query performance across varied data processing needs
   - Must analyze data characteristics to determine optimal storage strategies including compression, partitioning, and indexing

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Pipeline definitions must be testable with synthetic data sources
- Data quality gates must support validation with predefined test datasets
- Lineage tracking must provide verifiable transformation paths
- Incremental processing logic must be testable with simulated data changes
- Storage optimization strategies must have measurable performance metrics

### Performance Expectations
- Support data pipelines processing at least 100GB per execution
- Metadata operations must complete within 500ms
- Lineage queries must return results in under 2 seconds
- Incremental detection overhead should not exceed 5% of total processing time
- Quality checks should process at minimum 10MB/second per CPU core

### Integration Points
- Data source connectors (databases, APIs, file systems, streams)
- Data storage systems (object storage, data warehouses, data lakes)
- Metadata repositories for lineage information
- Monitoring systems for pipeline metrics
- Scheduling systems for recurring executions

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without requiring schema modifications to source systems
- Must maintain consistent state if processing is interrupted
- Must not duplicate data unnecessarily during transformation
- Must provide secure handling of sensitive data elements
- Must scale horizontally for large dataset processing

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Data Pipeline Orchestration Engine should provide:

1. **Workflow Definition System**
   - YAML/JSON-based directed acyclic graph workflow definition
   - Support for data-specific operators and transformations
   - Pipeline parameter configuration capability
   
2. **Data Quality System**
   - Rule-based validation framework
   - Statistical quality measurement tools
   - Conditional branching based on quality metrics
   - Quality metric history and trending
   
3. **Incremental Processing System**
   - Source data change detection mechanisms
   - Checkpoint management for tracking progress
   - Optimized differential processing strategies
   
4. **Lineage Tracking System**
   - Metadata collection for all transformations
   - Source-to-destination path reconstruction
   - Data transformation documentation
   
5. **Temporal Processing Framework**
   - Time window definition and management
   - Late arrival handling policies
   - Time-based partitioning strategies
   
6. **Storage Optimization Engine**
   - Data characteristic analysis
   - Compression strategy selection
   - Partitioning scheme recommendation and implementation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Workflows correctly execute the defined sequence of data transformations
- Data quality gates properly validate data according to defined rules
- Incremental processing correctly identifies and processes only new/changed data
- Lineage tracking accurately records all transformation steps and metadata
- Processing windows correctly handle data within defined time boundaries
- Storage optimization selects appropriate strategies based on data characteristics

### Critical User Scenarios
- Processing a new batch of data through a multi-stage transformation pipeline
- Handling a dataset that partially fails quality validation
- Reprocessing historical data with maintained lineage
- Processing late-arriving data within closed time windows
- Executing a pipeline with optimal storage format selection

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process 50GB of structured data through a standard pipeline in under 30 minutes
- Complete incremental processing detection for 1TB dataset in under 5 minutes
- Generate lineage report for complex pipeline within 10 seconds
- Apply quality validation rules at minimum 20MB/second
- Achieve at least 30% storage reduction through optimized format selection

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling source system unavailability during processing
- Recovering from partial pipeline failures
- Managing pipeline execution when storage systems are near capacity
- Handling schema evolution in source or destination systems
- Dealing with corrupt data records within larger valid datasets
- Processing extremely skewed data distributions

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for data quality validation logic
- All incremental processing scenarios must have dedicated test cases
- All data lineage paths must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end data flow with actual transformations

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
