# DevOps Workflow Automation Engine

A lightweight workflow automation engine specifically designed for DevOps deployment pipelines and infrastructure management at growing startups.

## Overview

This project implements a Python library for defining, executing, and monitoring complex deployment workflows across multiple environments without the overhead of enterprise orchestration tools. The system provides infrastructure-aware automation with sophisticated deployment strategies, robust error handling, and comprehensive auditing capabilities tailored to DevOps workflows.

## Persona Description

Alex manages deployment pipelines and infrastructure automation for a rapidly scaling startup. He needs to automate complex workflows across multiple environments without the overhead of enterprise orchestration tools or the limitations of simple CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Requirements

1. **Infrastructure State Awareness**: Implement functionality to dynamically adjust workflows based on current environment conditions.
   - Critical for Alex because deployment strategies must adapt to the current state of infrastructure components to avoid disruptions and ensure proper resource utilization.
   - System should be able to query infrastructure components (via APIs or command execution) and alter workflow paths based on their state.

2. **Deployment Strategy Implementation**: Support blue-green, canary, and progressive rollout deployment patterns.
   - Essential for Alex's startup to minimize downtime and mitigate risks during deployments as they scale their services.
   - System must orchestrate the complex sequence of steps for each deployment strategy, including traffic shifting, health monitoring, and automatic rollbacks.

3. **Notification Integration**: Connect with team collaboration tools to provide contextual deployment information.
   - Vital for Alex to keep all stakeholders informed about deployment status without manual reporting.
   - Must deliver relevant information to the right channels at appropriate stages of the workflow.

4. **Audit Trail Generation**: Document all infrastructure changes for compliance and troubleshooting.
   - Necessary for Alex to maintain accountability and diagnostic capability in a rapidly evolving infrastructure environment.
   - Should capture who initiated what changes, when, and with what parameters, along with the outcomes.

5. **Failure Recovery Orchestration**: Automatically implement rollback procedures when deployments fail.
   - Critical for Alex to minimize service disruptions and maintain system reliability during failed deployments.
   - Must detect failures at various stages, determine the appropriate recovery actions, and execute them automatically.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be fully testable with pytest without requiring actual infrastructure
- Mock objects must be available for all external services and infrastructure components
- State transitions in workflows must be explicitly testable
- Test fixtures should provide sample workflow definitions for all supported deployment strategies
- Asynchronous operations must be testable without timeline distortions

### Performance Expectations
- Workflow engine overhead should not exceed 100ms per task transition
- Support for parallel execution of independent workflow branches
- Ability to handle workflows with at least 100 discrete tasks
- State polling operations must implement backoff strategies to minimize API load
- Engine should support execution of at least 10 concurrent workflow instances

### Integration Points
- Infrastructure APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises systems)
- CI/CD pipeline triggers (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Monitoring and observability tools for state awareness
- Chat platforms and notification services (Slack, Teams, email)
- Version control systems for workflow definitions and audit trails

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - all functionality must be accessible via Python API
- Minimal external dependencies beyond Python standard library
- Stateless operation for workflow engine components where possible
- All sensitive information must be handled securely
- Execution environment must be isolated from definition environment

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library that enables:

1. **Workflow Definition**: A programmatic interface for defining complex deployment workflows as directed acyclic graphs with support for:
   - Task dependencies and execution order
   - Conditional branching based on task outcomes
   - Environment-specific parameters
   - Deployment strategy templates (blue-green, canary, progressive)
   - Infrastructure state checks and conditional paths

2. **Workflow Execution**: An execution engine that:
   - Resolves dependencies and executes tasks in the correct order
   - Implements deployment strategy logic with proper sequencing
   - Performs infrastructure state checks and dynamically adjusts paths
   - Manages parallel execution where appropriate
   - Implements proper error handling and failure recovery
   - Collects and reports task execution metrics

3. **Notification System**: A flexible notification mechanism that:
   - Integrates with multiple communication channels
   - Provides contextual information about deployment progress
   - Filters and routes notifications based on workflow state
   - Supports customizable message templates

4. **Audit System**: A comprehensive audit trail that:
   - Records all workflow executions with timestamps
   - Documents infrastructure changes with before/after states
   - Captures all parameters and environment conditions
   - Provides queryable history of deployment activities

5. **Recovery Orchestration**: An intelligent recovery system that:
   - Detects failures at various stages of deployment
   - Determines appropriate recovery strategies
   - Executes rollback procedures automatically
   - Reports on recovery actions and final state

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct execution of workflow tasks in dependency order
- Proper implementation of all deployment strategies
- Accurate infrastructure state detection and response
- Reliable notification delivery with correct content
- Complete audit trail generation with all required fields
- Successful rollback procedures under various failure conditions

### Critical User Scenarios
- Blue-green deployment with automatic rollback on failure
- Canary deployment with progressive traffic shifting
- Multi-environment deployment with different configurations
- Infrastructure-aware workflow with path changes based on state
- Complex workflow with parallel branches and conditional logic

### Performance Benchmarks
- Workflow execution overhead less than 100ms per task
- Support for workflows with 100+ tasks without memory issues
- Ability to run at least 10 concurrent workflow instances
- Efficient state polling with backoff strategy implementation
- Low latency notification delivery (under 1 second)

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of partial failures in multi-step deployments
- Proper cleanup after interrupted workflow execution
- Correct behavior when infrastructure state is ambiguous
- Graceful degradation when notification services are unavailable
- Proper handling of concurrent modifications to the same infrastructure

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core workflow engine
- 100% coverage of deployment strategy implementations
- 100% coverage of failure recovery paths
- All public APIs must have both positive and negative test cases
- Test parametrization for all supported deployment strategies

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if it demonstrates:

1. The ability to define and execute complex deployment workflows using all specified deployment strategies
2. Reliable detection of infrastructure state and dynamic workflow adaptation
3. Proper execution of rollback procedures under various failure conditions
4. Accurate and complete audit trail generation for all workflow activities
5. Timely and relevant notifications through team collaboration tools

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. Initialize the project with `uv init --lib`
2. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Run tests with `uv run pytest`
4. Run a single test with `uv run pytest path/to/test.py::test_function_name`
5. Format code with `uv run ruff format`
6. Lint code with `uv run ruff check .`
7. Type check with `uv run pyright`

To execute sample workflows during development:

```python
import pyflow

# Define a workflow
workflow = pyflow.Workflow("deployment")

# Add tasks and dependencies
workflow.add_task("check_infrastructure", infrastructure_check_function)
workflow.add_task("deploy_canary", deploy_canary_function, depends_on=["check_infrastructure"])
workflow.add_task("monitor_canary", monitor_canary_function, depends_on=["deploy_canary"])
workflow.add_task("shift_traffic", traffic_shift_function, depends_on=["monitor_canary"])
workflow.add_task("cleanup", cleanup_function, depends_on=["shift_traffic"])

# Add failure recovery
workflow.add_recovery("deploy_canary", rollback_canary_function)
workflow.add_recovery("shift_traffic", restore_traffic_function)

# Execute workflow
engine = pyflow.Engine()
result = engine.execute(workflow)

# Inspect results
print(result.status)
print(result.audit_trail)
```
