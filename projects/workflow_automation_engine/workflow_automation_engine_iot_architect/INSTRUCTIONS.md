# IoT Workflow Automation Engine

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for IoT solution architects, enabling high-volume event stream processing, coordinated device command orchestration, edge computing integration, sophisticated telemetry aggregation, and digital twin synchronization. This system provides reliable automation for complex IoT workflows managing thousands of connected devices with real-time responsiveness.

## Persona Description
Raj designs systems that process data from thousands of connected devices and need to respond to events in real-time. He requires workflow automation that can handle high-volume event processing with conditional logic and device control.

## Key Requirements
1. **Event Stream Processing**: Implement handling of high-volume device data with pattern recognition. This feature is critical for Raj because his IoT solutions generate thousands of events per second from diverse devices, and real-time pattern detection enables timely responses to important conditions while filtering out noise.

2. **Device Command Orchestration**: Create coordination of actions across multiple connected systems. Raj requires this capability because his solutions often need to orchestrate synchronized or sequenced commands across heterogeneous device types to implement complex system behaviors and responses to detected conditions.

3. **Edge Computing Integration**: Develop execution of portions of workflows on local gateways. This feature is vital for Raj as many of his deployments operate in environments with unreliable connectivity, and pushing appropriate workflow components to edge devices ensures critical operations continue even during central system disconnection.

4. **Telemetry Aggregation**: Implement statistical processing across device groups. Raj needs this functionality because individual device telemetry often has limited value, while aggregated analysis across device categories or geographical clusters reveals meaningful patterns and anomalies that drive system intelligence.

5. **Digital Twin Synchronization**: Build maintenance of virtual representations of physical devices. This capability is essential for Raj because digital twins enable advanced simulation, prediction, and optimization capabilities that are foundational to his IoT solutions' value proposition for operational technology environments.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Event processing must be testable with high-volume simulated device event streams
  - Command orchestration must be verifiable without requiring actual physical devices
  - Edge computing integration must be testable with simulated edge environments
  - Telemetry aggregation must be verifiable with synthetic device data patterns
  - Digital twin synchronization must be testable with simulated physical-virtual state changes

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Event stream processing should handle at least 10,000 events per second
  - Command orchestration should support coordinated actions across 1,000+ devices
  - Edge integration should enable workflow execution with up to 5-minute connectivity gaps
  - Telemetry aggregation should process data from 10,000+ devices within 1-minute windows
  - Digital twin synchronization should maintain consistency with < 5-second lag for critical states

- **Integration Points**:
  - IoT communication protocols (MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, etc.)
  - Device management platforms
  - Time-series databases
  - Edge computing frameworks
  - Digital twin platforms and services
  - Stream processing engines
  - Cloud IoT services (AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, etc.)

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All functionality must be implemented as libraries and APIs, not as applications with UIs
  - Must operate efficiently with limited computational resources
  - Must handle unreliable network connectivity scenarios
  - Must scale horizontally for large device deployments
  - Must maintain security boundaries between devices and systems
  - Should support both cloud and on-premises deployment models

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this IoT Workflow Automation Engine centers around high-volume device data processing and control:

1. **Workflow Definition System**: A Python API and YAML/JSON parser for defining IoT workflows with event triggers, device commands, edge execution directives, and digital twin interactions.

2. **Event Stream Processor**: Components for high-throughput ingestion, filtering, and pattern recognition across massive volumes of device-generated events, with support for complex event processing techniques.

3. **Command Orchestration Framework**: Modules for defining, validating, and executing coordinated command sequences across heterogeneous device types with appropriate timing, dependencies, and error handling.

4. **Edge Execution Manager**: Components that partition workflow execution between cloud and edge environments, synchronize state, and manage transitions between connected and disconnected operation.

5. **Telemetry Analytics Engine**: A system for defining and computing statistical aggregations, trends, and anomaly detection across device groups with time-window processing capabilities.

6. **Digital Twin Manager**: Modules for maintaining virtual device representations, keeping them synchronized with physical state, and enabling simulation and prediction capabilities.

7. **Execution Engine**: The core orchestrator that manages IoT workflow execution, handles event-driven processes, and coordinates the various components while maintaining workflow state.

- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
