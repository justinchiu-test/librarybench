# IoT Device Orchestration Framework

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for IoT solution architects to process high-volume data from connected devices, coordinate actions across distributed systems, and implement edge computing strategies. This system enables real-time event handling with sophisticated pattern recognition and device command orchestration.

## Persona Description
Raj designs systems that process data from thousands of connected devices and need to respond to events in real-time. He requires workflow automation that can handle high-volume event processing with conditional logic and device control.

## Key Requirements

1. **Event Stream Processing**
   - Handle high-volume device data with pattern recognition
   - Critical for Raj to detect meaningful patterns and anomalies in continuous IoT data streams
   - Must include stream ingestion, real-time analytics, pattern matching, and stateful processing

2. **Device Command Orchestration**
   - Coordinate actions across multiple connected systems
   - Essential for Raj to implement coordinated responses to events across distributed IoT devices
   - Must support command generation, delivery sequencing, acknowledgment handling, and failure recovery

3. **Edge Computing Integration**
   - Execute portions of workflows on local gateways
   - Vital for Raj to optimize performance and resilience in bandwidth-constrained environments
   - Must include workflow partitioning, edge deployment, offline operation, and synchronization mechanisms

4. **Telemetry Aggregation**
   - Implement statistical processing across device groups
   - Important for Raj to derive actionable insights from distributed sensor networks
   - Must support various aggregation functions, rolling windows, cross-device correlation, and composite metrics

5. **Digital Twin Synchronization**
   - Maintain virtual representations of physical devices
   - Critical for Raj to enable simulation, prediction, and virtual testing of IoT systems
   - Must include state modeling, bidirectional updates, historical data access, and simulation capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Stream processing must be testable with synthetic event generators
- Command orchestration must be verifiable with virtual device simulators
- Edge integration must be testable without physical edge devices
- Telemetry aggregation must be verifiable with predefined datasets
- Digital twin models must support testing through simulation interfaces

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 10,000 events per second per stream
- Coordinate commands across at least 1,000 devices simultaneously
- Support deployment to edge devices with at least 1GB RAM / 1GHz CPU
- Perform telemetry aggregation across 10,000 devices in under 5 seconds
- Synchronize digital twin states within 100ms of physical updates

### Integration Points
- MQTT, AMQP, and other IoT messaging protocols
- IoT platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Google IoT, etc.)
- Edge computing frameworks and gateways
- Time-series databases for telemetry storage
- Visualization and monitoring systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with minimal network bandwidth consumption
- Must function in environments with intermittent connectivity
- Must scale horizontally for large device fleets
- Must respect resource limitations of edge computing devices
- Must maintain security across distributed system boundaries

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Store-and-forward capabilities
   - Synchronization protocols
   
4. **Telemetry Processing System**

- Digital twin synchronization maintains consistent virtual representations

### Critical User Scenarios

- Deploying and executing workflows at the edge during network outages
- Aggregating and analyzing telemetry data from a large sensor network
- Using digital twins to predict and prevent potential device failures

### Performance Benchmarks
- Sustain event processing at 5,000 events per second with sub-100ms latency
- Execute coordinated command sequences across 500 devices in under 3 seconds
- Deploy and initialize edge workflows within 10 seconds on target devices

- Synchronize 1,000 digital twins with sub-second consistency

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling device connectivity interruptions during command execution
- Managing conflicting commands to the same device
- Recovering from edge device failures mid-workflow
- Processing corrupted or malformed telemetry data
- Handling time synchronization issues across distributed systems
- Recovering from partial failures in multi-device orchestration

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for command orchestration and security-critical paths
- All stream processing patterns must have dedicated test cases
- All edge deployment scenarios must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end workflows with simulated devices

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
