# IT Support Workflow Automation Engine

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for IT support specialists, enabling ticket-driven automation, user permission verification, guided troubleshooting with decision trees, self-service workflow publishing, and automated resolution documentation. This system provides reliable automation for common support tasks while ensuring consistent service quality and reducing manual effort.

## Persona Description
Elena handles user support requests and routine IT operations for a mid-sized company. She needs to automate common support workflows and repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and ensure consistent service quality.

## Key Requirements
1. **Ticket-Driven Workflow Triggers**: Implement automation initiation from help desk system events. This feature is critical for Elena because it eliminates the manual monitoring of support tickets and allows automatic routing and initial response to common issues, significantly reducing response time and ensuring no tickets are missed.

2. **User Permission Verification**: Create a system ensuring appropriate authorization before system changes. Elena requires this capability because many support tasks involve sensitive operations that must only be performed for users with proper permissions, and manual verification is both time-consuming and error-prone.

3. **Guided Troubleshooting**: Develop implementation of decision trees for common support issues. This feature is vital for Elena as it allows consistent problem diagnosis across her support team, ensuring that even junior team members follow best practices and standard procedures when resolving common technical problems.

4. **Self-Service Workflow Publishing**: Build functionality allowing end users to trigger pre-approved automations. Elena needs this functionality because it empowers users to resolve simple issues themselves without waiting for IT assistance, reducing both support ticket volume and resolution time for routine requests.

5. **Resolution Documentation**: Implement automatic recording of actions taken and outcomes. This capability is essential for Elena because comprehensive documentation is required for compliance and knowledge sharing, but manual documentation is often inconsistent or incomplete due to time constraints during busy support periods.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Ticket-driven triggers must be testable with simulated help desk events
  - User permission verification must be verifiable without requiring actual directory services
  - Guided troubleshooting logic must be testable with various decision paths
  - Self-service workflow mechanisms must be testable with mock user interactions
  - Resolution documentation must be verifiable for completeness and accuracy

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Ticket trigger response time should be under 5 seconds
  - Permission verification should complete within 3 seconds
  - Decision tree navigation should support trees with at least 50 nodes
  - Self-service portal should handle at least 100 concurrent user requests
  - Documentation generation should complete within 10 seconds per resolved ticket

- **Integration Points**:
  - Help desk and ticket management systems (ServiceNow, Jira Service Desk, etc.)
  - Directory services and identity providers (Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)
  - IT asset management systems
  - Remote management tools for endpoint systems
  - Knowledge base and documentation systems
  - Email and communication platforms
  - Monitoring and alerting systems

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All functionality must be implemented as libraries and APIs, not as applications with UIs
  - Must operate securely within corporate network environments
  - Must respect data privacy regulations for user information
  - Must maintain detailed audit logs of all automated actions
  - Must be resilient to network interruptions and system outages
  - Should operate with minimal performance impact on target systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this IT Support Workflow Automation Engine centers around efficient support task automation:

1. **Ticket Integration System**: Components that connect with help desk systems, monitor for relevant events, and trigger appropriate workflows based on ticket attributes.

2. **Permission Management Framework**: Modules that interface with directory services and access control systems to verify user permissions and authorization for requested actions.

3. **Decision Tree Engine**: A system for defining, executing, and managing troubleshooting decision trees that guide support processes through logical sequences of diagnostics and remediation steps.

4. **Self-Service Automation Portal**: Backend components that enable secure user-initiated execution of pre-approved support workflows with appropriate guardrails and validation.

5. **Documentation Generator**: Modules that automatically capture detailed records of all actions performed, system changes made, and outcomes achieved during automated support processes.

6. **Support Workflow Definition**: A Python API and YAML/JSON parser for defining IT support workflows with conditional logic, integration points, and appropriate error handling.

7. **Execution Engine**: The core orchestrator that manages workflow execution, handles dependencies between steps, and coordinates the various components while maintaining workflow state.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accurate triggering of workflows from ticket events
  - Proper verification of user permissions before actions
  - Correct navigation of troubleshooting decision trees
  - Secure execution of self-service automation workflows
  - Complete and accurate resolution documentation generation

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Password reset workflow triggered by help desk ticket
  - Software installation request with permission verification
  - Multi-step troubleshooting process for network connectivity issues
  - User-initiated disk cleanup workflow via self-service portal
  - Automated new employee onboarding with system provisioning
  - Complex incident resolution with complete audit trail generation

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Ticket event processing within 5 seconds
  - Permission verification within 3 seconds
  - Decision tree processing with 50+ nodes without significant delay
  - Handling of 100+ concurrent self-service requests
  - Documentation generation within 10 seconds per ticket

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Malformed ticket data from help desk system
  - Directory service outages during permission checks
  - Ambiguous decision paths in troubleshooting trees
  - Conflicting self-service requests from the same user
  - Failed actions requiring rollback and recovery
  - Incomplete data for documentation generation
  - Permission elevation attempts through self-service
  - System state changes during workflow execution

- **Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all core modules
  - 100% coverage for permission verification logic
  - 100% coverage for decision tree navigation
  - 100% coverage for self-service security controls
  - All error handling paths must be tested

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
