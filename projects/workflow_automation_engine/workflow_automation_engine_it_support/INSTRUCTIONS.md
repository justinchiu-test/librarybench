# IT Support Workflow Automation Engine

A specialized workflow automation engine for handling user support requests, automating common IT tasks, and ensuring consistent service quality.

## Overview

This project implements a Python library for defining, executing, and monitoring IT support workflows triggered by help desk tickets. The system provides ticket-driven workflow triggers, user permission verification, guided troubleshooting with decision trees, self-service workflow publishing, and automatic resolution documentation tailored specifically to IT support operations.

## Persona Description

Elena handles user support requests and routine IT operations for a mid-sized company. She needs to automate common support workflows and repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and ensure consistent service quality.

## Key Requirements

1. **Ticket-Driven Workflow Triggers**: Implement functionality to initiate automation from help desk system events.
   - Critical for Elena because it allows automation to begin immediately when tickets are submitted, reducing response time and eliminating manual monitoring.
   - System should integrate with help desk systems to detect new tickets, updates, and status changes, then launch appropriate workflows based on ticket properties.

2. **User Permission Verification**: Develop ensuring appropriate authorization before system changes.
   - Essential for Elena to maintain security and compliance when automation acts on behalf of users or modifies sensitive systems.
   - Must validate user permissions against directory services or access control systems before executing privileged operations.

3. **Guided Troubleshooting**: Create implementation of decision trees for common support issues.
   - Vital for Elena to standardize troubleshooting approaches and capture expert knowledge for consistent problem resolution.
   - Should execute step-by-step diagnostic procedures with conditional paths based on intermediate results.

4. **Self-Service Workflow Publishing**: Implement allowing end users to trigger pre-approved automations.
   - Necessary for Elena to reduce ticket volume by enabling users to resolve common issues without IT intervention.
   - Must provide a secure mechanism for non-technical users to execute pre-approved workflows with appropriate guardrails.

5. **Resolution Documentation**: Develop automatically recording actions taken and outcomes.
   - Critical for Elena to maintain complete records of all support activities without manual documentation.
   - Should capture all steps executed, their outcomes, any errors encountered, and the final resolution status.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be fully testable with pytest without requiring actual help desk systems
- Mock objects must be available for all external systems and directory services
- Decision tree logic must be testable with simulated troubleshooting scenarios
- Permission verification must be verifiable with sample user and permission data
- Documentation generation must produce predictable outputs for verification

### Performance Expectations
- Support for processing at least 100 concurrent support workflows
- Ticket trigger response time under 5 seconds
- Permission verification completed in under 2 seconds
- Decision tree traversal with minimal latency between steps
- Resolution documentation generation in under 3 seconds

### Integration Points
- Help desk and ticket management systems
- Directory services and identity providers
- System and application management APIs
- Knowledge base and documentation systems
- Communication platforms for user notifications

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - all functionality must be accessible via Python API
- Must handle sensitive credentials and permissions securely
- Support workflows must be interruptible and resumable
- System should operate with least privilege principles
- All actions must be fully auditable and traceable

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library that enables:

1. **Ticket Integration System**: A robust integration mechanism that:
   - Connects to help desk systems through APIs or webhooks
   - Detects relevant ticket events and properties
   - Maps ticket attributes to appropriate workflow templates
   - Initiates workflow execution based on ticket triggers
   - Updates ticket status based on workflow progress and outcomes

2. **Permission Management System**: A secure verification system that:
   - Validates user identities against directory services
   - Checks authorization for specific actions and resources
   - Implements role-based and attribute-based access control
   - Handles delegation and elevation of privileges when appropriate
   - Maintains comprehensive audit trails of all authorization decisions

3. **Troubleshooting Engine**: An intelligent diagnostic system that:
   - Executes decision tree-based troubleshooting procedures
   - Evaluates conditions and selects appropriate paths
   - Collects diagnostic information from various systems
   - Implements remediation actions based on diagnostic results
   - Adapts procedures based on environmental factors

4. **Self-Service Platform**: A secure execution platform that:
   - Publishes pre-approved workflows for end-user execution
   - Implements appropriate guardrails and limitations
   - Validates prerequisites before execution
   - Provides clear status updates and instructions
   - Ensures proper logging and oversight of user-initiated actions

5. **Documentation System**: A comprehensive recording system that:
   - Captures all actions performed during workflow execution
   - Records system states before and after changes
   - Documents troubleshooting paths and decision points
   - Generates standardized resolution reports
   - Integrates findings with knowledge management systems

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Proper integration with ticket systems and event handling
- Accurate permission validation against directory services
- Correct execution of decision tree-based troubleshooting
- Secure operation of self-service workflow execution
- Comprehensive documentation of all support activities

### Critical User Scenarios
- Password reset workflow triggered by help desk ticket
- Software installation request with permission verification
- Network connectivity troubleshooting with guided diagnostics
- User-initiated device enrollment through self-service portal
- Complex multi-step issue resolution with full documentation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Ticket event processing within 5 seconds of occurrence
- Permission verification completed in under 2 seconds
- Decision tree navigation with less than 1 second between steps
- Self-service workflow initiation response time under 3 seconds
- Documentation generation completed in under 3 seconds per workflow

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of ticket system outages or API failures
- Proper behavior when directory services are unavailable
- Recovery from interrupted troubleshooting procedures
- Appropriate action when self-service prerequisites aren't met
- Graceful degradation when documentation systems are unavailable

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for core workflow engine
- 100% coverage of ticket integration logic
- 100% coverage of permission verification paths
- All decision tree branches must be tested
- Complete verification of documentation generation accuracy

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if it demonstrates:

1. The ability to automatically trigger workflows from help desk ticket events
2. Reliable permission verification before executing privileged operations
3. Effective execution of decision tree-based troubleshooting procedures
4. Secure self-service workflow execution for end users
