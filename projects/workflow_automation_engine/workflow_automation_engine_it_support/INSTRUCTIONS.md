# IT Support Automation Platform

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for IT support specialists to streamline common support workflows and repetitive tasks. This system enables ticket-driven automation, guided troubleshooting, and self-service capabilities to increase efficiency and ensure consistent service quality.

## Persona Description
Elena handles user support requests and routine IT operations for a mid-sized company. She needs to automate common support workflows and repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and ensure consistent service quality.

## Key Requirements

1. **Ticket-Driven Workflow Triggers**
   - Initiate automation from help desk system events
   - Critical for Elena to automate responses to common support requests without manual intervention
   - Must include ticket monitoring, event detection, field extraction, and context-aware workflow selection

2. **User Permission Verification**
   - Ensure appropriate authorization before system changes
   - Essential for Elena to maintain security while automating privileged operations
   - Must include identity verification, role-based permission checking, approval workflows, and audit logging

3. **Guided Troubleshooting**
   - Implement decision trees for common support issues
   - Vital for Elena to standardize troubleshooting approaches and capture institutional knowledge
   - Must support branching logic, diagnostic step sequences, condition evaluation, and adaptive path selection

4. **Self-Service Workflow Publishing**
   - Allow end users to trigger pre-approved automations
   - Important for Elena to reduce ticket volume by enabling users to solve simple issues themselves
   - Must include workflow cataloging, simplified interfaces, guardrails for safe execution, and usage tracking

5. **Resolution Documentation**
   - Automatically record actions taken and outcomes
   - Critical for Elena to maintain consistent records and build knowledge base of solutions
   - Must capture detailed execution logs, generate human-readable summaries, and update knowledge management systems

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Ticket monitoring must be testable with simulated help desk events
- Permission verification must be verifiable with mock identity providers
- Troubleshooting logic must be testable with predetermined scenario paths
- Self-service workflows must be testable without actual user interfaces
- Documentation generation must produce verifiable and consistent outputs

### Performance Expectations
- Process ticket events and initiate workflows within 5 seconds
- Complete permission verification checks in under 1 second
- Support decision trees with at least 50 nodes and 100 branches
- Handle at least 100 concurrent self-service workflow executions
- Generate and store documentation in under 3 seconds per resolution

### Integration Points
- Help desk and ticket management systems (ServiceNow, Jira Service Desk, etc.)
- Identity and access management systems (Active Directory, Okta, etc.)
- Knowledge management and documentation systems
- Communication platforms for notifications (email, Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Monitoring and asset management systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without requiring schema changes to integrated systems
- Must preserve security boundaries and access controls
- Must gracefully handle disconnected operations for on-site support
- Must respect user privacy and data protection requirements
- Must operate within change management practices and policies

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The IT Support Automation Platform should provide:

1. **Ticket Integration System**
   - Event monitoring and detection
   - Field and context extraction
   - Classification and routing logic
   - Workflow triggering mechanisms
   
2. **Permission Management Framework**
   - Identity verification
   - Role and entitlement checking
   - Approval workflow management
   - Audit and compliance tracking
   
3. **Troubleshooting Engine**
   - Decision tree definition and storage
   - Conditional branching evaluation
   - Diagnostic step sequencing
   - Results collection and analysis
   
4. **Self-Service System**
   - Workflow catalogue and metadata
   - Parameter definition and validation
   - Execution boundary enforcement
   - Usage analytics collection
   
5. **Documentation Generator**
   - Activity logging and collection
   - Narrative summary creation
   - Knowledge base integration
   - Search indexing preparation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Ticket monitoring correctly identifies and extracts relevant information
- Permission verification properly enforces access control policies
- Troubleshooting logic accurately follows decision paths
- Self-service workflows execute safely within defined boundaries
- Documentation generation produces accurate and comprehensive records

### Critical User Scenarios
- Automatically responding to password reset requests
- Verifying permissions before granting system access
- Guiding a technician through network connectivity troubleshooting
- Enabling users to request and receive software installations
- Documenting complex support issues for knowledge base

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process and classify 50 tickets per minute
- Verify permissions against a directory with 10,000 users in under 2 seconds
- Navigate a 30-step decision tree in under 5 seconds
- Support at least 50 simultaneous self-service workflow executions
- Generate documentation including 100 steps in under 5 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed ticket data
- Managing conflicting or outdated permission information
- Recovering from interrupted troubleshooting workflows
- Dealing with invalid user input in self-service scenarios
- Handling integration system outages
- Responding to concurrent conflicting support requests

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for permission verification and security-critical paths
- All decision tree paths must have dedicated test cases
- All self-service boundaries must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end workflows with mocked systems

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. It enables automation of support workflows triggered by help desk tickets
2. It properly verifies user permissions before performing privileged operations
3. It accurately guides support staff through standardized troubleshooting procedures
4. It safely enables end users to execute pre-approved self-service workflows
