# Marketing Campaign Orchestration Engine

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for marketing automation managers to coordinate digital marketing campaigns across multiple channels and platforms. This system enables non-technical users to define complex marketing workflows, implement audience targeting rules, and automatically collect performance metrics.

## Persona Description
Carlos coordinates digital marketing campaigns across multiple channels and platforms. He needs to automate content publication, audience targeting, and analytics collection without deep technical expertise.

## Key Requirements

1. **Natural Language Workflow Definition**
   - Allow non-technical users to describe automation needs
   - Critical for Carlos who lacks programming expertise but needs to create sophisticated marketing workflows
   - Must include natural language parsing, intent recognition, and automatic workflow generation from plain text descriptions

2. **Marketing Platform Integration**
   - Connect with common advertising and content systems
   - Essential for Carlos to coordinate campaigns across the various platforms his team uses
   - Must support standard marketing APIs, authentication methods, and data exchange formats for major digital marketing platforms

3. **Audience Segmentation Logic**
   - Implement complex targeting rules across channels
   - Vital for Carlos to deliver personalized content to different audience segments
   - Must include segment definition, rule composition, cross-platform audience synchronization, and segment performance tracking

4. **Campaign Timing Coordination**
   - Schedule actions across global time zones
   - Important for Carlos who manages international marketing campaigns
   - Must support time zone awareness, optimal time delivery, embargo periods, and synchronized multi-channel publication

5. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   - Automatically gather and visualize campaign results
   - Critical for Carlos to measure effectiveness and optimize marketing strategies
   - Must include metrics definition, automated data collection, standardized reporting, and insights generation

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Natural language processing must be testable with standard input sets
- Platform integrations must be verifiable with API simulators
- Segmentation logic must be testable with synthetic audience data
- Timing coordination must be verifiable with mocked time systems
- Metrics collection must be testable with predefined performance datasets

### Performance Expectations
- Support natural language processing of workflow descriptions in under 2 seconds
- Handle audience segments with at least 1 million profiles
- Process segmentation rules in under 5 seconds for standard complexity
- Support scheduling precision of 1 minute across all time zones
- Collect and process metrics from at least 10 platforms simultaneously

### Integration Points
- Email marketing platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid, etc.)
- Social media marketing APIs (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Digital advertising platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc.)
- Content management systems (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)
- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, etc.)

### Key Constraints
- Must be usable by marketing professionals without technical background
- Must respect rate limits and API policies of integrated platforms
- Must maintain GDPR and privacy compliance for audience data
- Must operate without direct database access to marketing platforms
- Must provide consistent behavior across heterogeneous marketing systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Marketing Campaign Orchestration Engine should provide:

1. **Natural Language Processing System**
   - Text interpretation and intent recognition
   - Workflow structure extraction
   - Parameter identification
   - Error correction and suggestion
   
2. **Platform Connector Framework**
   - Authentication management
   - API integration adapters
   - Data format transformation
   - Rate limiting and retry logic
   
3. **Audience Management System**
   - Segment definition and storage
   - Rule evaluation engine
   - Cross-platform audience synchronization
   - Profile management and privacy controls
   
4. **Scheduling Framework**
   - Time zone optimization
   - Embargo period management
   - Delivery time personalization
   - Synchronization across channels
   
5. **Analytics Collection System**
   - Metrics definition and standardization
   - Automated data gathering
   - Performance calculation
   - Reporting and visualization

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Natural language processing correctly interprets marketing workflow descriptions
- Platform connectors properly integrate with marketing system APIs
- Audience segmentation logic accurately targets the right profiles
- Timing coordination correctly schedules actions across time zones
- Metrics collection accurately gathers and processes performance data

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a multi-channel campaign from a natural language description
- Segmenting an audience based on behavioral and demographic criteria
- Coordinating content publication across multiple platforms and time zones
- Tracking campaign performance across different channels
- Optimizing audience targeting based on performance metrics

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process natural language campaign description and generate workflow in under 3 seconds
- Evaluate segmentation rules against 100,000 profiles in under 10 seconds
- Calculate optimal delivery times for 50 global regions in under 5 seconds
- Collect and normalize metrics from 5 platforms in under 30 seconds
- Support at least 100 concurrent marketing workflow executions

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling ambiguous natural language instructions
- Managing API changes or outages in integrated platforms
- Processing incomplete or inconsistent audience data
- Dealing with time zone conflicts or daylight saving transitions
- Handling missing or delayed performance metrics
- Responding to rate limiting or throttling by marketing platforms

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for audience segmentation logic
- All natural language processing patterns must have dedicated test cases
- All platform integration pathways must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end marketing workflows with simulated platforms

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
