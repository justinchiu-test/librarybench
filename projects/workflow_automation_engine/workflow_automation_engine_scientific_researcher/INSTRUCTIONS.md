# Experimental Workflow Automation System

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for scientific researchers to orchestrate computational experiments with parameter variations, comprehensive metadata tracking, and reproducibility guarantees. This system enables researchers to define, execute, and document complex experimental pipelines while optimizing computational resource usage.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen conducts computational experiments that involve multiple processing steps and parameter variations. He needs to automate experiment workflows while tracking results and computational environments for reproducibility.

## Key Requirements

1. **Parameter Sweep Automation**
   - Execute workflows across multiple configuration combinations
   - Critical for Dr. Chen to explore parameter spaces efficiently without manual intervention
   - Must support multidimensional parameter grids, sampling strategies, and parallel execution of parameter combinations

2. **Experiment Metadata Capture**
   - Record all inputs, environments, and execution details
   - Essential for Dr. Chen to maintain scientific rigor and enable future reproduction of results
   - Must capture software versions, input parameters, random seeds, intermediate results, and execution environment details

3. **Computational Resource Optimization**
   - Schedule intensive tasks during off-peak hours
   - Important for Dr. Chen to maximize the use of shared computing resources in a research environment
   - Must include task scheduling, resource requirement estimation, and execution planning based on resource availability

4. **Result Visualization Generation**
   - Generate plots and dashboards from experimental outputs
   - Vital for Dr. Chen to quickly interpret results and identify patterns across parameter variations
   - Must support automated generation of common scientific visualizations with proper labeling and metadata inclusion

5. **Reproducibility Packaging**
   - Capture all workflow elements for future replication
   - Critical for Dr. Chen to share research, validate findings, and build upon previous work
   - Must include environment specification, input data references, parameter configurations, and execution sequence

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Experiment definitions must be testable with minimal sample data
- Parameter sweep logic must be verifiable with reduced parameter spaces
- Metadata capture must be complete and consistent across executions
- Resource management must be testable with simulated resource constraints
- Reproducibility packaging must be verifiable by re-execution tests

### Performance Expectations
- Support parameter sweeps with at least 1,000 combinations
- Metadata operations must complete within 100ms
- Resource scheduling must optimize for at least 80% resource utilization
- Visualization generation must handle result sets of at least 10GB
- Reproducibility packages must be generated in under 60 seconds

### Integration Points
- Computational backends (local, cluster, cloud)
- Scientific libraries and tools (NumPy, SciPy, domain-specific tools)
- Data storage systems (object storage, file systems)

- Resource management systems (SLURM, PBS, Kubernetes)

### Key Constraints
- Must work offline in environments with restricted network access
- Must minimize dependencies on external services
- Must maintain backward compatibility for reproducing older experiments
- Must handle large datasets efficiently without excessive memory usage
- Must operate in shared computing environments without privileged access

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Parameter dependency handling
   
3. **Metadata Collection System**
   - Automatic environment detail capture
   - Execution context recording
   - Input/output data cataloging
   
4. **Resource Management Framework**
   - Resource requirement estimation
   - Scheduling optimization algorithms
   - Execution planning with resource constraints
   
5. **Visualization Generator**

- Maintaining reproducibility with deprecated dependencies

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for reproducibility and metadata capture logic
- All parameter sweep strategies must have dedicated test cases
- All resource scheduling algorithms must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end experiment execution and reproduction

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
