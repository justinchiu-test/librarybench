# Server Fleet Management Automation System

## Overview
A specialized workflow automation engine designed for system administrators to orchestrate routine maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting procedures across large server fleets. This agentless system enables reliable automation that can work with existing infrastructure without requiring additional software installation on managed servers.

## Persona Description
Miguel manages hundreds of servers across multiple data centers and needs to automate routine maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting procedures. He requires reliable automation that can work with existing systems without installing agents.

## Key Requirements

1. **SSH-based Execution**
   - Securely run commands on remote systems without additional agents
   - Critical for Miguel who needs to manage systems where installing additional software is restricted or impractical
   - Must include secure credential management, connection pooling, and session persistence across workflow steps

2. **Progressive Execution**
   - Apply changes to server groups in controlled waves
   - Essential for Miguel to minimize risk when rolling out changes across large server fleets
   - Must support server group definitions, execution sequencing, and inter-wave validation checks

3. **Maintenance Window Scheduling**
   - Coordinate tasks during approved change periods
   - Vital for Miguel to ensure operations comply with organizational change management policies
   - Must include calendar integration, change window awareness, and execution timing controls

4. **Configuration Verification**
   - Compare system state before and after changes
   - Important for Miguel to validate successful changes and detect unintended side effects
   - Must capture system state snapshots, perform comparison analyses, and generate comprehensive change reports

5. **Parallel Execution Optimization**
   - Maximize efficiency while respecting system constraints
   - Critical for Miguel to complete maintenance within limited time windows across large server fleets
   - Must include intelligent parallelism, resource utilization monitoring, and adaptive throttling

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Remote execution mechanisms must be testable with virtual environments
- Progressive execution must be verifiable with simulated server groups
- Scheduling logic must be testable with mocked time and calendar systems
- Configuration verification must work with predefined system state snapshots
- Parallelism strategies must be testable with synthetic load simulation

### Performance Expectations
- Support simultaneous connections to at least 500 servers
- Complete configuration verification in under 30 seconds per server
- Schedule optimization must complete in under 5 seconds for complex server fleets
- Command execution latency must not exceed 100ms above baseline SSH latency
- State comparison operations must process at minimum 100 configuration items per second

### Integration Points
- SSH subsystem for remote command execution
- Configuration management databases (CMDBs)
- Change management and approval systems
- Monitoring systems for validation checks
- Inventory and asset management systems

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without requiring additional software on target servers
- Must work with existing SSH key infrastructure
- Must handle heterogeneous operating systems and configurations
- Must respect existing security boundaries and access controls
- Must not interfere with critical server operations

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Server Fleet Management Automation System should provide:

1. **SSH Connection Management**
   - Secure credential storage and retrieval
   - Connection pooling and reuse
   - Session persistence across workflow steps
   - Execution tracking and logging
   
2. **Server Grouping System**
   - Server group definition and management
   - Dynamic grouping based on attributes
   - Execution wave planning and sequencing
   
3. **Scheduling Framework**
   - Maintenance window definition and enforcement
   - Calendar integration and awareness
   - Execution timing optimization
   
4. **Configuration Management**
   - System state capture and storage
   - Change detection algorithms
   - Difference analysis and reporting
   
5. **Parallel Execution Engine**
   - Dynamic parallelism adjustment
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Throttling and backpressure mechanisms
   
6. **Workflow Definition System**
   - YAML/JSON-based workflow definition
   - Task dependency specification
   - Conditional execution rules

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Remote execution correctly runs commands on target systems
- Progressive execution properly applies changes in configured waves
- Scheduling correctly respects defined maintenance windows
- Configuration verification accurately detects and reports changes
- Parallel execution optimizes performance within defined constraints

### Critical User Scenarios
- Deploying a critical update across a multi-datacenter server fleet
- Performing routine maintenance during scheduled change windows
- Rolling back a failed configuration change
- Troubleshooting an issue across a subset of servers
- Verifying compliance with configuration standards

### Performance Benchmarks
- Connect to and verify 100 servers in under 5 minutes
- Execute a standard patch workflow across 500 servers in under 30 minutes
- Complete configuration verification for 1,000 items in under 1 minute per server
- Optimize execution plans for 1,000-server fleet in under 10 seconds
- Process and analyze 10MB of configuration data in under 5 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling network partitions during remote execution
- Recovering from interrupted operations mid-workflow
- Managing SSH connectivity issues to specific servers
- Dealing with unexpected system state changes during workflow
- Handling timeout conditions in long-running commands
- Responding to authentication failures or expired credentials

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for SSH execution and security-critical code paths
- All execution strategies must have dedicated test cases
- All configuration comparison algorithms must be verified by tests
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end workflows against mock servers

IMPORTANT: 
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
