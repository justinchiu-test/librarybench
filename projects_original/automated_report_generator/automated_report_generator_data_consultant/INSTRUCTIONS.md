# Multi-Client Reporting Platform

A specialized automated report generation framework for freelance data consultants to create consistent, branded reports for diverse clients across different industries.

## Overview

The Multi-Client Reporting Platform is a Python-based library designed to streamline the creation of data reports for freelance consultants working with multiple clients. It provides tools to store client configurations, apply consistent branding, leverage industry-specific templates, track report generation for billing, and deliver reports through a secure client portal.

## Persona Description

Maya is a freelance consultant who creates custom data reports for multiple clients across different industries. Her primary goal is to quickly adapt reporting templates and data pipelines for new clients while maintaining consistent branding and quality.

## Key Requirements

1. **Client Configuration Management**: Create a robust system to store and manage connection settings, preferences, and reporting requirements for multiple clients.
   - *Critical for Maya because*: Working with many clients simultaneously requires maintaining separate environments and settings for each, and manually reconfiguring for each client project would be highly inefficient and error-prone.

2. **White-Labeling System**: Develop functionality to automatically apply client branding elements (logos, colors, typography, etc.) to reports while maintaining consistent structure.
   - *Critical for Maya because*: Professional deliverables must reflect each client's brand identity, but manually adjusting design elements for each report would consume excessive time better spent on analysis.

3. **Template Marketplace**: Build a template library with industry-specific report layouts that can be quickly customized for individual client needs.
   - *Critical for Maya because*: Starting each client project from scratch is inefficient, but being able to quickly select and modify industry-appropriate templates dramatically accelerates project initialization.

4. **Billing Integration**: Implement tracking mechanisms that record report generation activities to support accurate client invoicing based on deliverables.
   - *Critical for Maya because*: As a freelancer, accurate time and deliverable tracking is essential for proper billing, and automatic logging of report generation activities ensures all billable work is captured.

5. **Client Portal**: Create a secure delivery system where clients can access, comment on, and collaborate on reports.
   - *Critical for Maya because*: Professional delivery of confidential client reports requires more security and functionality than email attachments, and a dedicated portal improves client experience while streamlining the review process.
