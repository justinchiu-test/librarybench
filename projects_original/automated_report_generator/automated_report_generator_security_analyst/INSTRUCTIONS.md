# Security Posture Reporting Framework

A specialized automated report generation framework for IT security analysts to transform complex security data into actionable intelligence for both executive leadership and technical teams.

## Overview

The Security Posture Reporting Framework is a Python-based library designed to generate comprehensive security reports that effectively communicate an organization's security status to diverse audiences. It integrates data from various security tools, calculates risk metrics, maps findings to compliance requirements, and produces tailored reports with appropriate detail levels for different stakeholders.

## Persona Description

Jamal works in cybersecurity and needs to generate security posture reports for executive leadership and technical teams. His goal is to transform complex security data into actionable intelligence with appropriate detail levels for different audiences.

## Key Requirements

1. **Security Tool Integration**: Implement connectors for various security systems including SIEM platforms, vulnerability scanners, and threat intelligence services to consolidate security data.
   - *Critical for Jamal because*: Security data exists in multiple disconnected systems, and manually extracting and normalizing this information is extremely time-consuming and error-prone, potentially causing critical vulnerabilities to be overlooked.

2. **Risk Scoring Framework**: Develop algorithms that prioritize security findings based on business impact, exploitability, and threat landscape to focus attention on the most critical issues.
   - *Critical for Jamal because*: Organizations face thousands of potential vulnerabilities and security events, and without sophisticated prioritization, security teams waste time on low-impact issues while critical threats may go unaddressed.

3. **Compliance Mapping System**: Create a mapping system that links security findings to specific regulatory requirements and frameworks (NIST, ISO, GDPR, etc.) to track compliance status.
   - *Critical for Jamal because*: Modern organizations must comply with multiple overlapping regulations, and manually tracking how specific security controls satisfy various frameworks is practically impossible without systematic support.

4. **Remediation Lifecycle Tracking**: Build functionality to track vulnerability lifecycles from discovery through remediation, including historical trending of security issues over time.
   - *Critical for Jamal because*: Effective security management requires understanding not just current vulnerabilities but how quickly issues are being resolved, recurring patterns, and progress trends that indicate the effectiveness of security programs.

5. **Technical Detail Adaptation**: Implement a system that adjusts the level of technical detail in reports based on the audience, from executive summaries to detailed technical findings.
   - *Critical for Jamal because*: Security communication fails when executives receive overly technical reports they cannot understand or when technical teams receive oversimplified summaries without actionable details, making audience-appropriate reporting essential.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All security tool connectors must be testable with synthetic vulnerability and incident data
- Risk scoring algorithms must be verifiable with standardized test cases
- Compliance mapping must be testable against regulatory framework requirements
- Report generation must be verifiable for different audience types

### Performance Expectations
- System must efficiently process data from 10+ security tools simultaneously
- Risk calculation must handle 10,000+ vulnerabilities in under 1 minute
- Report generation must complete within 2 minutes for comprehensive security reports
- Historical analysis must efficiently process years of vulnerability and incident data

### Integration Points
- Standard connectors for common security tools (SIEM, vulnerability scanners, etc.)
- Import capabilities for threat intelligence feeds
- Compatibility with governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platforms
- Export capabilities to PDF, interactive HTML, and security dashboards

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain security of sensitive vulnerability information
- Must support air-gapped environments with limited connectivity
- Must adapt to evolving threat landscape and compliance requirements
- Must function with incomplete data from some security systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Security Posture Reporting Framework must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Security Data Acquisition**
   - Connect to and extract data from various security systems
   - Normalize diverse security findings into a common format
   - Correlate related findings across different tools
   - Handle incremental updates and delta reporting

2. **Risk Assessment Engine**
   - Calculate risk scores based on multiple factors
   - Prioritize findings by potential business impact
   - Incorporate threat intelligence for context
   - Track risk levels over time

3. **Compliance Management**
   - Map security controls to compliance requirements
   - Track compliance status across multiple frameworks
   - Identify compliance gaps and recommendations
   - Support evidence collection for audits

4. **Remediation Tracking**
   - Monitor vulnerability lifecycles from discovery to resolution
   - Calculate key metrics (mean time to remediate, aging, etc.)
   - Track accountability for remediation tasks
   - Identify recurring or persistent issues

5. **Audience-Specific Reporting**
   - Generate executive summaries with business-focused metrics
   - Create detailed technical reports for security teams
   - Produce role-specific reports for IT operations, development, etc.
   - Support both periodic reporting and ad-hoc queries

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify

1. **Data Integration Reliability**
   - Verify that connectors can accurately extract data from various security tools
   - Test handling of inconsistent or conflicting security findings
   - Verify appropriate normalization of diverse vulnerability formats
   - Confirm proper correlation of related findings from different sources

2. **Risk Assessment Accuracy**
   - Verify risk scoring algorithms against industry standards
   - Test prioritization with various vulnerability and threat scenarios
   - Verify appropriate incorporation of business context
   - Confirm consistent risk evaluation across similar findings

3. **Compliance Mapping Correctness**

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
