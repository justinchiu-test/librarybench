# DevOps Task Tracker - CLI Task Management for Infrastructure Operations

## Overview
A specialized command-line task management system tailored for DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure across cloud providers. The system enables tracking operations tasks with clear ownership and completion status, associating tasks with specific systems, and recording time spent on different infrastructure components for accurate client billing.

## Persona Description
Marcus manages infrastructure across cloud providers and needs to track operations tasks with clear ownership and completion status. His primary goal is to associate tasks with specific systems and track time spent on different infrastructure components for client billing.

## Key Requirements
1. **Infrastructure Tagging System**: Create a comprehensive tagging mechanism that links tasks to specific servers, services, or infrastructure components. This feature is critical for Marcus to maintain a clear mapping between tasks and the systems they affect, enabling efficient troubleshooting and maintenance across complex cloud environments.

2. **Automated Task Creation from Alerts**: Implement an API interface that allows automatic task creation from system monitoring alerts and tools. This capability enables Marcus to have monitoring systems automatically generate tasks when issues are detected, ensuring critical problems are tracked without manual entry and maintaining a complete record of all system issues.

3. **Command Output Capture**: Develop a mechanism to document and store the exact commands run for task completion, along with their outputs. This feature provides Marcus with a precise record of infrastructure changes, supporting audit requirements and creating self-documenting tasks that can be referenced when similar issues arise.

4. **Time Tracking with Billing Integration**: Implement detailed time tracking functionality that associates work periods with client/project codes for billing reports. This capability is essential for Marcus to accurately bill clients for infrastructure work, track time efficiency across different types of tasks, and provide transparent documentation of billable hours.

5. **Runbook Generation from Tasks**: Create functionality to convert sequences of completed tasks into structured runbooks or procedures. This allows Marcus to transform successfully completed task sequences into reusable documentation, standardizing operational procedures and reducing the time needed to address recurring issues.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have isolated unit tests with dependency injection to facilitate mocking
- Infrastructure tagging system must be tested independently of task management core functionality
- Command capture functionality must be testable without actually executing system commands
- Time tracking calculations must be verifiable with precision to the second
- Runbook generation must be testable with predetermined task sequences and expected output formats

### Performance Expectations
- The system must support linking to at least 10,000 infrastructure components without performance degradation
- Task creation API must handle at least 50 simultaneous alert-generated tasks
- Command output storage must efficiently handle outputs up to 1MB per command
- Time tracking queries across 6 months of data must complete in under 3 seconds
- Runbook generation from 100+ task sequences must complete in under 5 seconds

### Integration Points
- Integration with monitoring systems via webhooks/API endpoints
- Command execution environment capture mechanism
- Time tracking export compatible with common billing systems (CSV, JSON formats)
- Infrastructure component database with tagging schema
- Version-controlled storage for generated runbooks

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must be portable across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
- All functionality must be accessible programmatically without UI components
- Sensitive infrastructure information must be masked in logs and exports
- Data storage must support encryption for security compliance
- Time tracking must account for timezone differences in distributed infrastructure

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Task Management Engine**: A core module handling CRUD operations for tasks with support for custom attributes, status tracking, assignment, and priority management.

2. **Infrastructure Linkage System**: A component that maintains relationships between tasks and infrastructure components through a flexible tagging system, supporting hierarchical infrastructure organization.

3. **Command Documentation System**: Functionality to capture, store, and retrieve command executions associated with tasks, including the command string, environment, output, and timestamp.

4. **Time Recording Framework**: A precise time tracking system that logs work periods against tasks with client/project metadata, supporting reporting and billing operations.

5. **Alert Integration API**: An endpoint system that receives and processes alerts from monitoring tools, automatically creating appropriately tagged and prioritized tasks.

6. **Runbook Generation Engine**: Logic to analyze task sequences, identify patterns, and generate structured documentation from successful completion paths.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by a CLI tool (though implementing the CLI itself is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with all required metadata
- Infrastructure tagging operations including adding, modifying, and querying by tags
- Command capture storage and retrieval with exact output preservation
- Time tracking start/stop operations and duration calculations
- Alert-to-task conversion with proper metadata inheritance
- Runbook generation with proper formatting and sequence preservation

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete infrastructure maintenance workflow from planning to execution to documentation
- Client-specific task filtering and time report generation
- Alert storm handling with proper task consolidation
- Cross-system task management spanning multiple cloud providers
- Historical command retrieval for audit purposes

### Performance Benchmarks
- Task creation rate of at least 100 tasks per second during alert storms
- Time tracking operations must have <50ms overhead
- Infrastructure query operations must complete in <100ms for complex queries
- Command storage operations must handle outputs up to 10MB
- Runbook generation must process at least 20 tasks per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of malformed alerts from monitoring systems
- Recovery from interrupted time tracking sessions
- Conflict resolution for tasks affecting the same infrastructure
- Handling of very long-running tasks spanning multiple days
- Proper error handling for invalid infrastructure references
- Graceful degradation when storage is approaching capacity

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Integration tests must verify all external system interfaces

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system demonstrates the ability to track tasks linked to at least three different types of infrastructure components.
3. Time tracking functionality accurately records and reports time spent on tasks with billing code association.
4. Alert-triggered task creation works reliably with properly formatted alerts.
5. Generated runbooks maintain proper formatting and include all relevant command information.
6. The implementation is well-structured with clean separation of concerns between components.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. Code quality meets professional standards with appropriate documentation.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
