# High-Frequency Trading Task Scheduler

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed for high-frequency trading systems that process market data and execute trading algorithms with ultra-low latency. This system ensures that critical financial operations meet strict timing guarantees while optimizing overall throughput, with particular attention to nanosecond precision, hardware optimization, and performance anomaly detection.

## Persona Description
Sophia builds high-frequency trading systems that must process market data and execute trading algorithms with minimal latency. Her primary goal is to ensure critical tasks meet strict timing guarantees while maximizing overall system throughput.

## Key Requirements

1. **Latency-Focused Scheduling System**
   - Implement a scheduling mechanism with nanosecond precision timing capabilities optimized for ultra-low latency operations
   - This feature is critical for Sophia as financial trading algorithms require precise execution timing to capitalize on market opportunities that exist for microseconds or less
   - The system must minimize scheduling overhead and jitter while providing deterministic execution guarantees

2. **Critical Path Optimization**
   - Create an intelligent task prioritization system that automatically identifies and reorders tasks to optimize critical paths in the execution graph
   - This feature is essential for Sophia as it reduces end-to-end latency for transaction processing by ensuring that tasks on the critical path receive priority resource allocation
   - Must dynamically update critical path analysis as execution proceeds and market conditions change

3. **Hardware Affinity Management**
   - Develop a sophisticated resource allocation system that optimizes task placement for processor cache utilization and memory access patterns
   - This feature is crucial for Sophia as it minimizes latency by ensuring optimal use of hardware capabilities, including cache locality, NUMA awareness, and specialized instruction sets
   - Must include configurable pinning of critical tasks to specific CPU cores and memory regions

4. **Real-time Performance Anomaly Detection**
   - Implement a monitoring system that detects and responds to performance anomalies in real-time with minimal overhead
   - This feature is vital for Sophia as it allows immediate identification and mitigation of latency spikes that could impact trading strategies and cause financial losses
   - Must include adaptive baseline modeling and sub-microsecond response capabilities

5. **Low-Latency Logging System**
   - Create a high-performance logging mechanism that captures detailed execution metrics with minimal impact on system performance
   - This feature is important for Sophia to support both post-mortem analysis of trading performance and regulatory compliance requirements without compromising system latency
   - Must include configurable verbosity levels and efficient storage strategies for high-volume log data

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be independently testable with precise latency measurement
- System must support cycle-accurate simulation for deterministic testing
- Test harnesses must provide nanosecond-resolution timing verification
- Test coverage should exceed 95% for all latency-critical code paths

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 10,000 tasks per second with sub-microsecond scheduling latency
- 99.9th percentile latency deviation less than 10 microseconds for critical tasks

- System should maintain performance guarantees under 95% CPU load

### Integration Points
- Integration with market data feeds (FIX, FAST, proprietary protocols)
- Support for trading algorithm frameworks and execution systems
- Interfaces for monitoring and risk management systems
- Compatibility with regulatory reporting mechanisms (MiFID II, Reg NMS)

### Key Constraints
- IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.
- The system must maintain strict determinism for reproducible behavior
- All operations must be fully auditable for regulatory compliance
- Must operate correctly in environments with microsecond timing requirements
- System must be resilient to market data anomalies and hardware glitches

## Core Functionality

The High-Frequency Trading Task Scheduler must provide:

1. **Precision Task Definition and Scheduling**
   - A high-performance API for defining time-critical tasks with their resource requirements
   - Support for nanosecond-precision scheduling and execution timing
   - Deterministic execution guarantees for critical trading operations

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Intelligent CPU core and memory allocation for optimal hardware utilization
   - Cache-aware task placement to minimize memory access latency
   - Support for specialized hardware acceleration (FPGA, ASIC integration)

3. **Performance Monitoring and Adaptation**
   - Real-time collection of latency and throughput metrics with minimal overhead
   - Statistical analysis of performance patterns to detect anomalies
   - Dynamic adjustment of scheduling parameters based on observed conditions

4. **Critical Path Management**
   - Automatic identification of execution-critical task sequences
   - Priority boosting for tasks on the critical path
   - Preemption capabilities for high-priority market events

5. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Low-overhead logging of all trading decisions and their timing
   - Reproducible execution for regulatory investigation
   - Performance record maintenance for strategy evaluation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Task scheduling consistently achieves sub-microsecond precision
- Critical path optimization correctly identifies and prioritizes key tasks
- Hardware affinity controls effectively optimize cache and memory utilization
- Anomaly detection correctly identifies performance outliers
- Logging system maintains performance without impacting latency

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Handling of market data bursts during high-volatility periods

- Maintenance of performance under sustained high load

### Performance Benchmarks
- Scheduling overhead should not exceed 500 nanoseconds per task
- 99.9th percentile scheduling jitter should be less than 1 microsecond

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 95% line coverage for all latency-critical components
- Comprehensive timing tests for all scheduling operations
- Performance tests under various load conditions and market scenarios
- Statistical verification of latency distribution properties

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Scheduling operations consistently maintain sub-microsecond latency
2. Critical path optimization reduces end-to-end execution time by at least 20%
3. Hardware affinity controls improve cache utilization by at least 25%
4. Performance anomaly detection identifies issues within 10 microseconds
5. Logging system captures all required data with less than 1% performance impact

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing

## Setup Instructions

1. Setup a virtual environment using UV:
   ```
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. CRITICAL: Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate pytest_results.json:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a critical requirement for project completion.
