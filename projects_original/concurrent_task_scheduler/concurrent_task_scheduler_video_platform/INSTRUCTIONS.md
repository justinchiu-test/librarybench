# Video Processing Pipeline Orchestrator

## Overview
A specialized concurrent task scheduler designed for video streaming platforms that process thousands of video uploads while generating multiple encoding formats. This system optimizes the encoding pipeline for different content types while ensuring premium content receives priority treatment, with particular focus on value-based prioritization, content-specific optimizations, and quality-deadline balancing.

## Persona Description
Mateo works on a video streaming platform that processes thousands of video uploads while generating multiple encoding formats. His primary goal is to optimize the encoding pipeline for different content types while ensuring premium content gets priority treatment.

## Key Requirements

1. **Content Value Prioritization System**
   - Implement an intelligent scheduling mechanism with dynamic tier adjustment based on content value metrics such as creator status, expected viewership, monetization potential, and premium classification
   - This feature is critical for Mateo as it ensures that high-value content (premium shows, trending videos, monetized content) receives faster processing and higher resource allocation
   - The system must automatically assess content value and adjust processing priority throughout the encoding pipeline

2. **Encoding Recipe Specialization**
   - Create a sophisticated encoding optimization system that selects and customizes encoding parameters based on content characteristics such as motion complexity, visual detail, and audio requirements
   - This feature is essential for Mateo to maximize both quality and efficiency by using content-aware encoding strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches
   - Must include content analysis capabilities that inform encoding decisions to optimize quality-to-bitrate ratio

3. **Predictive Resource Allocation**
   - Develop a forecasting system that analyzes incoming content to predict processing requirements and proactively allocate appropriate resources
   - This feature is crucial for Mateo to optimize hardware utilization by matching processing capacity to the specific demands of individual videos before encoding begins
   - Must incorporate machine learning to predict resource needs based on content type, duration, and complexity

4. **Processing Deadline Guarantees**
   - Implement a deadline management system with automatic quality adjustment to ensure content becomes available within promised timeframes
   - This feature is vital for Mateo to maintain service level agreements with content providers while handling varying system load conditions
   - Must support flexible quality-vs-speed tradeoffs when deadlines are at risk of being missed

5. **Multi-stage Pipeline Optimization**
   - Create a format-specific parallelism engine that optimizes each encoding stage based on the output format characteristics
   - This feature is important for Mateo because different output formats (HD, 4K, mobile, etc.) have unique processing requirements that benefit from specialized optimization
   - Must support dynamic allocation of resources across pipeline stages to eliminate bottlenecks

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be independently testable with well-defined interfaces
- System must support simulation of video encoding without requiring actual video processing
- Test coverage should exceed 90% for all scheduling and priority management components
- Tests must validate behavior under various load conditions and content mixtures

### Performance Expectations
- Support for processing at least 10,000 video uploads per day across various formats
- Encoding throughput should scale linearly with hardware resources up to at least 1,000 concurrent jobs
- System should achieve at least 95% resource utilization during peak periods
- Premium content should complete processing at least 3x faster than non-priority content under load

### Integration Points
- Integration with common encoding libraries and frameworks (FFmpeg, x264, VP9)
- Support for cloud transcoding services and hardware acceleration
- Interfaces for content management systems and distribution networks
- Compatibility with media asset management and metadata systems

### Key Constraints
- IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.
- The system must ensure consistent quality standards across all output formats
- All processing operations must maintain content security and access controls
- Must operate efficiently in cloud-based and hybrid infrastructure environments
- System must be resilient to processing failures with appropriate recovery mechanisms

## Core Functionality

The Video Processing Pipeline Orchestrator must provide:

1. **Content Ingestion and Analysis**
   - High-performance mechanisms for receiving and analyzing video uploads
   - Classification of content based on value metrics and technical characteristics
   - Initial resource requirement estimation and priority assignment

2. **Encoding Pipeline Management**
   - Definition and execution of multi-stage encoding workflows
   - Dynamic allocation of resources across pipeline stages
   - Format-specific optimization of encoding parameters

3. **Resource Allocation and Scheduling**
   - Priority-based allocation of processing resources
   - Deadline-aware scheduling with quality-time tradeoff capabilities
   - Efficient utilization of specialized hardware acceleration

4. **Performance Monitoring and Adaptation**
   - Collection of detailed metrics across the encoding pipeline
   - Detection of bottlenecks and processing anomalies
   - Dynamic adjustment of encoding strategies based on observed performance

5. **Quality Assurance and Delivery**
   - Verification of encoded outputs against quality standards
   - Management of content delivery to distribution systems
   - Support for emergency processing of high-priority content

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Content value prioritization correctly influences processing order and resource allocation
- Encoding recipes properly optimize for different content characteristics
- Predictive resource allocation accurately matches hardware to content requirements
- Deadline guarantees are met through appropriate quality-time tradeoffs
- Multi-stage pipeline optimization effectively eliminates processing bottlenecks

### Critical Scenarios to Test
- Processing of mixed content types during peak upload periods
- Handling of extremely high-value content requiring immediate processing
- Response to hardware failures during encoding operations
- Management of deadline conflicts between competing high-priority content
- Performance under various content complexity distributions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Priority content should complete encoding at least 3x faster than non-priority content
- Content-aware encoding should improve quality-to-bitrate ratio by at least 20%
- Predictive resource allocation should be accurate within 15% for 90% of content
- System should meet 99.5% of processing deadlines through appropriate adaptation
- Multi-stage pipeline optimization should improve overall throughput by at least 25%

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of malformed or corrupted video uploads
- Recovery from encoder crashes or failures
- Correct behavior under extreme resource contention

- Graceful degradation when capacity is exceeded

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all scheduling and encoding management components
- Comprehensive integration tests for end-to-end encoding workflows
- Performance tests simulating various content mixes and load conditions
- Quality verification tests for encoding optimization strategies

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
