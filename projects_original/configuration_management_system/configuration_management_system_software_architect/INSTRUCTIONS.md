# Architectural Configuration Management System

## Overview
A sophisticated configuration management system designed specifically for architects of complex distributed systems, enabling them to maintain configuration consistency across microservices while supporting service-specific customizations. This system provides dependency modeling, schema versioning, architectural boundary enforcement, API-first configuration management, and configuration-as-code workflows.

## Persona Description
Elena designs complex distributed systems that need to maintain configuration consistency across microservices while allowing for service-specific customizations. Her primary goal is to create configuration hierarchies that ensure architectural integrity while enabling rapid service evolution.

## Key Requirements
1. **Service Dependency Modeling with Configuration Inheritance Visualization** - Provides powerful tools to model dependencies between services and visualize how configuration settings inherit and override across the service hierarchy. This is critical for Elena because understanding the complex web of configuration dependencies is essential for maintaining system integrity during architecture evolution and preventing cascading failures from configuration changes.

2. **Schema Versioning with Backward Compatibility Verification** - Implements a robust schema versioning system for configuration definitions that tracks changes over time and automatically verifies backward compatibility between schema versions. This allows Elena to evolve configuration schemas as services evolve while ensuring that configuration changes don't break existing service implementations or disrupt the distributed system.

3. **Architectural Boundary Enforcement through Configuration Namespaces** - Enforces architectural boundaries by organizing configurations into strictly controlled namespaces that align with system domains, preventing cross-boundary configuration dependencies that would violate architectural principles. This helps Elena maintain a clean architecture by ensuring that configuration access patterns respect the intended architectural boundaries and service contracts.

4. **API-first Configuration Management with Service Discovery Integration** - Provides an API-first approach to configuration management that integrates with service discovery mechanisms, allowing services to dynamically discover and access their configuration based on their identity and role in the architecture. This enables Elena's microservices to bootstrap themselves with the right configuration without hard-coding environment-specific details.

5. **Configuration-as-Code Workflows with Architectural Review Automation** - Supports configuration-as-code practices with integrated architectural review tools that automatically analyze configuration changes for architectural impact and compliance with design principles. This helps Elena's team move quickly while still maintaining architectural governance, identifying potentially problematic configuration changes before they're deployed.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**: Configuration resolution logic must be fully testable with mocked service dependencies. Schema compatibility checks must be verifiable with automated tests. Namespace boundary enforcement must have comprehensive test coverage.

- **Performance Expectations**: Configuration resolution must be highly efficient, completing within 50ms even for complex service hierarchies with hundreds of dependencies. Schema validation must complete within 100ms for typical configuration sizes.

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must integrate with service mesh and service discovery systems
  - Must support standard schema definition formats (JSON Schema, OpenAPI, etc.)
  - Must provide hooks for CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Must integrate with version control systems for configuration-as-code

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must support distributed operation in multi-region deployments
  - Must maintain backward compatibility for at least three major schema versions
  - Must be resilient to partial system failures
  - Must support incremental adoption in existing systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality required for this architecture-focused configuration management system includes:

1. **Service Dependency Model**:
   - Service relationship graph modeling
   - Configuration inheritance path resolution
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Dependency visualization data generation

2. **Schema Management System**:
   - Schema definition and validation
   - Schema versioning with semantic versioning
   - Backwards compatibility analysis
   - Schema evolution recommendations

3. **Architectural Boundary Enforcement**:
   - Namespace definition and management
   - Cross-namespace reference control
   - Boundary violation detection
   - Exemption mechanism with justification

4. **API-first Configuration Access**:
   - RESTful and gRPC API interfaces for configuration
   - Service identity-based configuration resolution
   - Dynamic configuration updates
   - Configuration subscription for change notification

5. **Configuration Workflow Engine**:
   - Configuration change lifecycle management
   - Architectural impact analysis
   - Review automation and policy checking
   - Deployment coordination with services

6. **Configuration Version Control**:
   - Configuration history and tracking
   - Diff and merge operations
   - Rollback functionality
   - Branch management for configuration variants

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive pytest tests that validate all aspects of the system:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct resolution of configurations across service dependencies
  - Accurate detection of schema compatibility issues
  - Proper enforcement of architectural boundaries
  - Correct operation of API-based configuration access
  - Accurate architectural impact analysis of configuration changes

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Adding a new service to an existing architecture
  - Evolving a configuration schema with backward compatibility
  - Refactoring architectural boundaries
  - Integrating a new service with configuration APIs
  - Reviewing configuration changes for architectural compliance

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Configuration resolution must complete within 50ms for a service with 20 dependencies
  - Schema validation must process 10MB of configuration data within 1 second
  - API endpoints must handle 1000 requests per second
  - Dependency graph operations must scale to 500+ services
  - Configuration change analysis must complete within 5 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling circular dependencies in service relationships
  - Managing incompatible schema changes
  - Resolving conflicting configuration values
  - Recovering from service discovery failures
  - Handling partial deployments during configuration updates

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% line coverage for all modules
  - 100% coverage of configuration resolution logic
  - All API endpoints must have integration tests
  - All schema compatibility rules must have test cases
  - All architectural boundary enforcement logic must be tested

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Service dependencies are correctly modeled and configuration inheritance works accurately across the service hierarchy.
2. Schema versioning correctly tracks changes and verifies backward compatibility.
3. Architectural boundaries are properly enforced through namespace controls.
4. API-first configuration management integrates with service discovery.
5. Configuration-as-code workflows include architectural review automation.
6. All specified performance benchmarks are met consistently.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up the development environment:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using `uv venv`
3. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
