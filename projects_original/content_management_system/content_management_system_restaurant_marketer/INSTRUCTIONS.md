# Multi-Location Restaurant Content Management System

## Overview
A specialized content management system designed for restaurant chains to manage multiple locations while maintaining brand consistency. This system enables marketing directors to coordinate promotions across locations while allowing individual restaurant managers to update their specific details and local specials.

## Persona Description
Priya oversees marketing for a regional restaurant chain with multiple locations, each needing location-specific content while maintaining brand consistency. Her primary goal is to coordinate promotions across locations while allowing individual restaurant managers to update their specific details and local specials.

## Key Requirements

1. **Multi-location management with centralized and local content control**
   - Critical for Priya to maintain consistent brand messaging while enabling location-specific customization
   - Must implement hierarchical content inheritance where global templates can be locally customized
   - Should include approval workflows for local content changes to ensure brand compliance

2. **Menu system with pricing variations by location**
   - Essential for managing menu items that may have different pricing or availability across locations
   - Must support product information management with location-specific overrides
   - Should include seasonal and limited-time offer management

3. **Promotion scheduler with location-specific override options**
   - Important for coordinating marketing campaigns across multiple locations with local adaptations
   - Must support planning and scheduling of promotions with start/end dates
   - Should include location targeting and exclusion capabilities

4. **Franchise-specific dashboard showing content update compliance**
   - Necessary for monitoring whether individual locations are keeping their content current
   - Must track required updates and their implementation status across locations
   - Should highlight non-compliant locations and pending required changes

5. **Brand asset library with usage guidelines enforcement**
   - Valuable for maintaining visual consistency while providing location managers with approved assets
   - Must organize and tag brand assets for appropriate contexts and usage
   - Should include validation against brand guidelines for local customizations

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have unit tests with at least 90% code coverage
- Integration tests must verify the content inheritance system functions correctly
- Performance tests must ensure system scales with increasing number of locations
- Mock approval workflows for testing content validation

### Performance Expectations
- Location-specific content must load within 300ms regardless of chain size
- Menu updates must propagate to affected locations within 5 minutes
- Promotion creation must support at least 50 concurrent campaigns
- Dashboard metrics must calculate within 10 seconds for chains up to 100 locations

### Integration Points
- POS systems for menu and pricing synchronization
- Reservation platforms for location-specific availability
- Marketing automation tools for promotion distribution
- Analytics systems for performance tracking

### Key Constraints
- Brand guidelines must be programmatically enforceable
- Location data must be synchronized across multiple platforms
- System must scale to support chains with up to 500 locations
- Performance must not degrade with increased content volume

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library with the following core components:

1. **Multi-Location Management**
   - Location data model with hierarchy and relationships
   - Content inheritance and override mechanisms
   - Location-specific customization controls
   - Global and local permission management

2. **Menu Management**
   - Product information management
   - Location-specific pricing and availability
   - Seasonal and limited-time offer handling
   - Nutritional information and allergen tracking

3. **Promotion Coordination**
   - Campaign creation and scheduling
   - Location targeting and exclusion rules
   - Promotion asset management
   - Performance tracking and reporting

4. **Compliance Monitoring**
   - Update requirement definition
   - Implementation status tracking
   - Compliance reporting and alerts
   - Required action notifications

5. **Brand Asset Management**
   - Asset organization and categorization
   - Usage context definition
   - Guideline rule implementation
   - Validation and approval workflow

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Content inheritance correctly applies global changes while preserving local customizations
- Menu system accurately manages items with location-specific pricing and availability
- Promotion scheduler correctly targets appropriate locations with proper timing
- Compliance dashboard accurately reflects update status across locations
- Brand asset system enforces usage guidelines for local customizations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Creating a chain-wide menu update with location-specific pricing
- Launching a promotional campaign with varying offers by location
- Monitoring compliance with required content updates across locations
- Providing new brand assets with usage guidelines to location managers
- Setting up a new location with appropriate content inheritance

### Performance Benchmarks
- System must support up to 500 locations without performance degradation
- Content updates must propagate to all affected locations within 10 minutes
- Compliance calculations must complete within 30 seconds for the entire chain
- Menu system must support at least 1,000 unique items with location variations

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling conflicting location-specific overrides
- Managing promotion conflicts and overlapping schedules
- Recovering from incomplete content updates
- Resolving brand guideline violations
- Handling location openings and closings

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of content inheritance logic
- 100% coverage of promotion scheduling logic
- 100% coverage of compliance calculation algorithms

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The multi-location system effectively manages content with appropriate inheritance and local customization
2. The menu system correctly handles items with location-specific variations
3. The promotion scheduler accurately coordinates campaigns across targeted locations
4. The compliance dashboard correctly tracks and reports update status
5. The brand asset library effectively enforces usage guidelines

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
2. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
