# Social Media Analytics Stream Processing Framework

## Overview
A specialized data stream processing framework designed to monitor, analyze, and extract insights from social media content across multiple platforms in real-time. The system processes unstructured text data at scale, identifies emerging trends, and tracks sentiment shifts to support brand management and reputation monitoring.

## Persona Description
Jamal develops systems to monitor social media engagement and sentiment across various platforms for brand management. His primary goal is to process unstructured text data at scale while identifying trending topics and sentiment shifts in real-time.

## Key Requirements
1. **Natural language processing pipeline for sentiment extraction**: Implement a modular text processing pipeline that can accurately classify sentiment in social media posts across multiple languages, slang usage, and content types (text, captions, comments). This capability is essential for measuring brand perception and detecting emerging reputation issues that require immediate response.

2. **Trend detection algorithms with configurable significance thresholds**: Create algorithms that identify emerging topics and conversations across social platforms, with configurable thresholds for determining what constitutes a significant trend based on velocity, volume, and reach metrics. This trending topic analysis helps brands identify viral content and conversations that present opportunities or risks.

3. **Platform-specific data enrichment with API rate limiting**: Develop a framework for enriching social media data through platform-specific APIs (e.g., retrieving additional user metadata, engagement metrics, or conversation threads) while intelligently managing API rate limits and quotas. This enrichment adds crucial context to social analysis while respecting platform constraints.

4. **Entity recognition and relationship mapping across posts**: Build advanced entity extraction capabilities that identify and correlate mentions of brands, products, people, and places across separate posts and platforms, constructing a relationship graph of entities and conversations. This network analysis reveals influential connection points and conversation patterns not visible in isolated post analysis.

5. **Engagement spike detection with automated alert thresholds**: Implement a system that baseline normal engagement patterns for monitored topics and automatically detects significant deviations that warrant attention, with self-calibrating thresholds based on historical patterns. This early warning system ensures timely awareness of viral content or emerging crises.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Must support testing with synthetic social media post datasets
  - Needs validation of sentiment analysis accuracy against human-labeled data
  - Requires reproducible testing of trend detection algorithms
  - Must support simulation of engagement pattern changes
  - Needs automated validation of entity extraction precision and recall

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Ability to process at least 50,000 social media posts per minute
  - Sentiment analysis latency under 200ms per post
  - Support for at least 500 concurrent monitoring topics
  - Trend detection refreshed at least every 5 minutes
  - Entity relationship graph updates within 1 minute of new data

- **Integration Points**:
  - Social media platform APIs (Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Reddit, etc.)
  - Media monitoring and PR systems
  - Customer relationship management platforms
  - Crisis management workflow systems
  - Content management and publishing tools

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must comply with social platform API terms of service
  - Implementation must respect rate limits and quotas
  - System must handle unstructured and multilingual content
  - Processing must adapt to platform API changes
  - Analysis must be resilient to spam and bot activity

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a framework for social media analytics that:

1. Ingests social media content from multiple platforms via APIs and data streams
2. Processes unstructured text with natural language processing:
   - Language detection and normalization
   - Tokenization and part-of-speech tagging
   - Entity extraction and classification
   - Sentiment analysis and classification
3. Identifies emerging trends through algorithmic analysis:
   - Volume and velocity measurement
   - Acceleration detection
   - Reach and amplification tracking
4. Enriches data with additional context from platform APIs
5. Constructs entity relationship networks from mentions and interactions
6. Detects unusual engagement patterns compared to baselines
7. Generates alerts for significant sentiment shifts or trend emergence
8. Manages API rate limits and quotas across platforms
9. Provides extensible interfaces for custom analytical components

The implementation should emphasize accuracy of text analysis, scalability for high-volume social media streams, and adaptability to evolving social platforms and content types.

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Accuracy of sentiment analysis across content types
  - Effectiveness of trend detection algorithms
  - Proper handling of platform API rate limits
  - Precision of entity recognition and relationship mapping
  - Reliability of engagement spike detection

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Detection of emerging negative sentiment around a brand
  - Identification of rapidly growing conversations relevant to monitored topics
  - Mapping of entity relationships in complex, multi-platform discussions
  - Recognition of unusual engagement patterns indicating viral content
  - Enrichment of posts with additional context while respecting API limits

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Processing throughput of 50,000+ posts per minute
  - Sentiment analysis accuracy of at least 80% against human-labeled test data
  - Trend detection sensitivity capturing 90% of human-identified trends
  - Entity recognition precision and recall above 85%
  - Alert generation within 5 minutes of significant pattern changes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of platform API outages or rate limit rejections
  - Processing of mixed-language and code-switched content
  - Analysis of sarcasm, irony, and ambiguous sentiment
  - Behavior during sudden viral events with 100x normal volume
  - Response to platform-specific format and API changes

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 100% coverage of NLP pipeline components
  - >90% line coverage for all production code
  - 100% coverage of API integration error handling
  - Comprehensive tests with multi-language content
  - Performance tests at anticipated peak loads

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation will demonstrate:

1. Accurate extraction of sentiment from diverse social media content
2. Effective identification of emerging trends and conversations
3. Intelligent enrichment of data while respecting platform API constraints
4. Precise recognition of entities and their relationships across posts
5. Reliable detection of unusual engagement patterns and spikes
6. Scalability to handle high-volume social media monitoring
7. Comprehensive test coverage with all tests passing

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions

To setup the development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment
2. From within the project directory, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY for project completion:
