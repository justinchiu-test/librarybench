# Telecommunications Network Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
A specialized data stream processing framework designed to analyze high-volume telecommunications data including call detail records and network traffic metrics. The system provides advanced statistical analysis capabilities, network topology awareness, and real-time anomaly detection to optimize telecommunications infrastructure and ensure service quality.

## Persona Description
Emma analyzes call detail records and network traffic data to optimize telecommunications infrastructure and detect service anomalies. Her primary goal is to perform complex statistical analysis on high-volume data streams while identifying network issues in real-time.

## Key Requirements
1. **Sliding window analysis with configurable decay functions**: Implement a flexible windowing system that supports different temporal views of network metrics (seconds to days) with configurable weight decay functions that emphasize recent data while maintaining historical context. This capability is essential for analyzing time-sensitive network patterns like usage spikes, gradual degradations, and cyclic variations across different timeframes.

2. **Topology-aware data routing matching network structure**: Create a processing framework that understands the physical and logical structure of the telecommunications network and routes data processing accordingly. This topology awareness allows analytics to be partitioned naturally along network boundaries, reducing cross-node data transfers and enabling hierarchical aggregation that mirrors the network's design.

3. **Anomaly detection algorithms with self-tuning thresholds**: Develop algorithms that automatically identify abnormal patterns in network metrics while continuously adjusting detection thresholds based on historical patterns, time of day, and seasonality factors. This adaptive approach minimizes false positives during normal variations while ensuring sensitivity to genuine service issues that require intervention.

4. **Multi-dimensional data cube construction for interactive analysis**: Build a system that dynamically constructs multi-dimensional aggregation cubes from streaming data, enabling rapid interactive analysis across dimensions like geography, time, service type, and equipment class. This in-memory OLAP capability supports root cause analysis by allowing exploration of correlated factors across millions of network events.

5. **Service quality metric extraction with SLA threshold monitoring**: Implement real-time extraction of key performance indicators from raw network data and continuously compare these against service level agreement thresholds. This monitoring capability identifies SLA violations as they occur, enabling proactive interventions before customers experience significant service degradation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Must support simulation with synthetic network traffic patterns
  - Needs reproducible testing with historical network event datasets
  - Requires isolation and verification of statistical processing accuracy
  - Must support validation of anomaly detection sensitivity and specificity
  - Needs performance verification under various network load scenarios

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Ability to process at least 100,000 network events per second
  - Support for at least 10,000 monitored network elements
  - Analysis latency under 5 seconds for real-time metrics
  - Support for at least 20 concurrent dimensional aggregations
  - Query response time under 1 second for interactive data exploration

- **Integration Points**:
  - Network equipment monitoring systems
  - Call detail record collection infrastructure
  - Billing and rating systems
  - Service level agreement monitoring platforms
  - Network operations center alerting systems

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Must maintain continuous operation 24/7 without maintenance windows
  - Processing must scale dynamically with network growth
  - Implementation must handle schema evolution as network equipment changes
  - Analysis must be accurate despite data collection timing variations
  - Storage requirements must be optimized for cost efficiency

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must provide a framework for telecommunications data analysis that:

1. Ingests diverse network data sources, including:
   - Call detail records
   - Network equipment performance metrics
   - Traffic flow statistics
   - Quality of service measurements
2. Implements time-based windowing with configurable parameters
3. Processes data in a topology-aware manner that reflects network structure
4. Provides statistical analysis capabilities, including:
   - Trend detection and forecasting
   - Anomaly identification with adaptive thresholds
   - Correlation analysis across metrics
   - Dimensional aggregation for interactive exploration
5. Continuously monitors service quality metrics against SLA thresholds
6. Generates alerts when anomalies or SLA violations are detected
7. Maintains historical context for comparative analysis
8. Supports both real-time monitoring and batch analysis modes

The implementation should emphasize statistical accuracy, scalability with network growth, and the ability to detect service issues proactively.

## Testing Requirements

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of data collection gaps and out-of-sequence events
  - Processing behavior during network topology changes
  - Anomaly detection during major network events (e.g., sports events)
  - Response to corrupted or malformed network metric data
  - Behavior during extreme traffic conditions (holidays, emergencies)

  - 100% coverage of statistical analysis algorithms
  - >90% line coverage for all production code
  - 100% coverage of anomaly detection logic
  - Validation tests with known statistical distributions
  - Performance tests at 2x expected production scale

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
