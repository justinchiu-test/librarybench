# Financial Risk Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework specialized for financial risk analysis that enables sophisticated Monte Carlo simulations across diverse economic scenarios. The framework provides powerful tools for quantifying portfolio risk exposure, optimizing hedging strategies, and generating regulatory compliance reports with statistical confidence.

## Persona Description
Sophia evaluates investment portfolios by simulating market conditions and economic scenarios. Her primary goal is to run Monte Carlo simulations across diverse economic scenarios to quantify risk exposure and optimize hedging strategies.

## Key Requirements

1. **Distributed Monte Carlo Engine with Stratified Sampling**  
   Implement a high-performance Monte Carlo simulation engine that uses stratified sampling techniques to efficiently explore the probability space across distributed computing resources. This capability is critical for Sophia because financial risk assessment requires generating millions of potential future scenarios, and stratified sampling ensures comprehensive coverage of the probability space with significantly fewer simulations than naive random sampling.

2. **Correlation Preservation Across Simulated Market Factors**  
   Develop a system for maintaining complex correlation structures between multiple market factors (interest rates, equity prices, exchange rates, etc.) throughout simulation runs. This feature is vital because financial instruments are exposed to multiple correlated risk factors, and failing to preserve these correlations would produce unrealistic scenarios that dramatically underestimate tail risks arising from correlated movements.

3. **Extreme Event Modeling with Realistic Tail Distributions**  
   Create specialized models for simulating extreme market events with appropriate fat-tailed distributions and regime-switching capabilities. This functionality is essential because standard normal distributions severely underestimate the probability of extreme market moves, and Sophia needs to accurately quantify tail risks that, though rare, can cause catastrophic portfolio losses.

4. **Portfolio Optimization Based on Simulation Outcomes**  
   Build optimization algorithms that can analyze simulation results to recommend portfolio adjustments that minimize risk for a given return target or maximize return for a given risk tolerance. This capability allows Sophia to transform risk analysis into actionable investment decisions, providing concrete recommendations rather than just risk metrics.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Reporting with Risk Quantification**  
   Implement comprehensive reporting tools that generate regulatory-compliant risk metrics (VaR, Expected Shortfall, stress test results) with appropriate confidence intervals and supporting evidence. This feature is crucial because financial institutions must submit detailed risk reports to regulatory authorities, and Sophia needs to generate these reports efficiently while ensuring they meet all regulatory requirements.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All random number generation must support fixed seeds for reproducible testing
- Market factor models must be calibratable to historical data
- Correlation structures must be verifiable against reference implementations
- Risk metrics must be validatable using analytical solutions for simple cases
- Optimization algorithms must converge to known optimal solutions for test portfolios

### Performance Expectations
- Must support at least 10 million Monte Carlo simulation paths
- Should process at least 100,000 simulation paths per minute on standard hardware
- Must handle portfolios with at least 10,000 financial instruments
- Should simulate at least 100 correlated market factors simultaneously
- Optimization algorithms should converge within 5 minutes for standard portfolios

### Integration Points
- Data interfaces for importing market data and portfolio positions
- API for defining custom market factor models

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:

```

The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass and is a critical requirement for project completion.
