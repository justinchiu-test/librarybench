# Manufacturing Process Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework specialized for manufacturing engineers to model and optimize complex assembly lines with robotic components. The framework enables identification of production bottlenecks, testing of layout changes, and optimization of manufacturing processes in a virtual environment before implementing costly physical modifications.

## Persona Description
Fatima optimizes industrial manufacturing processes by simulating complex assembly lines with robotic components. Her primary goal is to identify bottlenecks and test layout changes in virtual environments before implementing costly physical modifications to the factory floor.

## Key Requirements

1. **Digital Twin Synchronization with Real-Time Factory Data**  
   Implement a system for creating and maintaining digital twins of manufacturing processes that can be synchronized with real-time data from factory sensors and control systems. This capability is critical for Fatima because accurate simulations require up-to-date representation of the actual manufacturing environment, and real-time synchronization allows her to validate simulation models against current factory performance and identify discrepancies.

2. **Process Variation Modeling with Statistical Distribution**  
   Develop comprehensive modeling of process variations based on statistical distributions derived from historical performance data. This feature is vital because real manufacturing processes exhibit natural variations in cycle times, defect rates, and other parameters, and accurately modeling these variations allows Fatima to design robust processes that perform well under realistic conditions rather than just idealized scenarios.

3. **Equipment Failure Simulation with Maintenance Scheduling**  
   Create simulation capabilities for modeling equipment failures based on reliability models and evaluating maintenance scheduling strategies to minimize production impact. This functionality is essential because equipment downtime significantly affects manufacturing performance, and optimizing maintenance schedules allows Fatima to balance preventive maintenance costs against the risk and impact of unexpected failures.

4. **Component-Level Simulation with Physics-Based Interactions**  
   Build a detailed simulation system that models individual machine components with physics-based interactions, including kinematics, dynamics, and collision detection. This capability is crucial because many manufacturing bottlenecks and issues occur at the component interaction level, and detailed simulation allows Fatima to identify and resolve interference issues, timing problems, and other physical constraints before implementing changes.

5. **Optimization Algorithms for Layout and Scheduling Improvements**  
   Implement advanced optimization algorithms that can automatically evaluate multiple layout configurations and scheduling policies to identify optimal solutions. This feature is important because the number of possible manufacturing configurations is too large to evaluate manually, and algorithmic optimization allows Fatima to discover non-obvious improvements that significantly enhance productivity and efficiency.

## Technical Requirements

  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report

  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
