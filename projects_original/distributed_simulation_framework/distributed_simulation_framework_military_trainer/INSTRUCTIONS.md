# Tactical Combat Simulation Framework

## Overview
A distributed simulation framework specialized for military training that creates realistic combat simulations with intelligent adversaries. The framework enables training personnel to practice tactical decision-making in complex scenarios with adaptive opponents, fog of war conditions, and realistic command and control environments while efficiently utilizing available computing resources.

## Persona Description
Major Chen develops training simulations for military personnel to practice decision-making in complex scenarios. His primary goal is to create realistic combat simulations with intelligent adversaries that adapt to trainee decisions while efficiently utilizing limited computing resources.

## Key Requirements

1. **Adversarial AI with Adaptive Tactical Behavior**  
   Implement sophisticated AI agents capable of employing diverse military tactics, adapting to trainee actions, and learning from previous encounters to present increasingly challenging and realistic opposition. This capability is critical for Major Chen because effective training requires opponents that can surprise trainees with intelligent counter-strategies rather than following predictable patterns, forcing personnel to continually reassess and adapt their own tactics.

2. **Terrain-Aware Partitioning for Distributed Computation**  
   Develop an intelligent simulation partitioning system that divides the battlespace based on terrain features, unit concentrations, and engagement likelihood to optimize computational resource utilization. This feature is vital because military simulations often involve large operational areas with varying activity densities, and terrain-aware partitioning allows Major Chen to allocate limited computing resources to high-activity areas while maintaining simulation fidelity throughout the entire battlespace.

3. **Realistic Command and Control Simulation with Fog of War**  
   Create a comprehensive command and control system that realistically models information flow constraints, communication latencies, and incomplete battlefield awareness (fog of war). This functionality is essential because military decision-making is heavily influenced by information availability and uncertainty, and realistic simulation of these constraints ensures training scenarios develop critical skills in operating with imperfect information.

4. **Decision Point Analysis for After-Action Review**  
   Build analytical tools that identify critical decision points during scenario execution, track consequence chains, and provide structured data for comprehensive after-action reviews. This capability enables Major Chen to conduct effective debriefing sessions focused on key learning moments, helping trainees understand how specific decisions influenced scenario outcomes and providing objective data for performance evaluation.

5. **Scenario Authoring Tools for Instructor Customization**  
   Implement a flexible scenario definition system allowing military instructors to rapidly create and modify training scenarios with customized terrain, force compositions, mission objectives, and triggering events. This feature is important because different training objectives require specialized scenarios, and authoring tools allow Major Chen and other instructors to quickly develop targeted scenarios that address specific training needs without requiring programming expertise.

## Technical Requirements
