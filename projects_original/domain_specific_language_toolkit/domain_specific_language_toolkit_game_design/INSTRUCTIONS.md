# Game Narrative and Logic Definition Toolkit

## Overview
A specialized Domain Specific Language toolkit for creating and implementing complex game narratives, quest systems, and character interactions. This toolkit enables game designers and narrative writers to define sophisticated game logic and storytelling elements without requiring programmer intervention, while ensuring these elements integrate seamlessly with the game's core systems.

## Persona Description
Alex leads a team creating an RPG game with complex character progression and quest systems. His primary goal is to build a game logic language that allows narrative designers and game designers to create intricate quest lines and character interactions without requiring programmer intervention.

## Key Requirements
1. **Narrative branching visualization with consequence tracking**: Tools for defining and visualizing complex branching narratives with explicit tracking of how player choices affect future story options and game state. This is critical because modern RPGs feature intricate narratives with numerous decision points, and designers need to understand and manage the combinatorial complexity of player choice consequences throughout the game.

2. **Character state management with personality trait modeling**: A system for defining character attributes, personality traits, and relationship dynamics that evolve based on player interactions and game events. This is essential because believable characters with consistent personalities that respond appropriately to player actions are fundamental to engaging RPG storytelling, and systematic modeling ensures coherent character behavior.

3. **World state persistence with trigger-based event system**: Mechanisms for tracking persistent changes to the game world and triggering appropriate events based on combinations of world state conditions. This is vital because a responsive, persistent game world creates immersion and player agency, allowing designers to create environments that meaningfully change based on player actions and game progression.

4. **Economy balancing tools with progression curve analysis**: Analytical tools to model and balance the game's economy, resource flows, and progression systems to ensure appropriate difficulty curves and reward pacing. This is necessary because balanced progression is central to player engagement, and mathematical modeling helps identify potential progression bottlenecks, difficulty spikes, or resource imbalances before they affect player experience.

5. **Quest dependency validation preventing progression deadlocks**: Automated analysis of quest dependencies and prerequisites to identify potential progression blockers, unreachable content, or logical contradictions in quest requirements. This is crucial because complex quest systems with interdependencies can easily develop logical errors that block player progression, and automated validation helps ensure all content is accessible through intended gameplay paths.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Each narrative branch must be automatically verifiable for consistency
  - Character state models must be testable with simulated interaction sequences
  - World state persistence must demonstrate correct event triggering
  - Economy models must be validated against target progression curves
  - All components must achieve at least 90% test coverage

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Narrative branch analysis must process 1000+ story nodes in under 30 seconds
  - Character state updates must compute in under 5ms to maintain game performance
  - World state triggers must evaluate 500+ conditions in under 10ms
  - Economy simulations must model 10,000+ player actions in under 60 seconds

- **Integration Points**:
  - Game engines (Unity, Unreal, etc.) through standardized interfaces
  - Dialogue and localization systems
  - Animation and cutscene management
  - Save/load mechanisms for persistence
  - Game analytics platforms for player behavior tracking

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must be in Python with no UI components
  - All game logic must be expressible through the DSL without requiring custom code
  - DSL scripts must be storable as human-readable text files
  - System must operate within memory constraints of target gaming platforms
  - Runtime performance must not impact game frame rates or player experience

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The Game Narrative and Logic DSL Toolkit must provide:

1. A domain-specific language parser and interpreter specialized for game narratives and logic
2. Narrative branching tools with consequence tracking and visualization
3. Character trait and relationship modeling systems
4. World state management with condition-based event triggers
5. Economy and progression curve analysis and balancing tools
6. Quest dependency validation and progression path analysis
7. Integration mechanisms for connecting with game engine systems
8. Debugging utilities for testing narrative and gameplay scenarios
9. Documentation generators for design team collaboration
10. Performance optimization for runtime execution in game environments

The system should enable game designers to define elements such as:
- Dialogue trees with conditional branches
- Character personality traits and interaction patterns
- Quest objectives, rewards, and dependencies
- Item properties and economy balance values
- Environmental interactions and world state changes
- Narrative consequences based on player choices
- Achievement criteria and progression milestones
- Event triggers and gameplay state conditions

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Correct parsing of DSL syntax into executable game logic
  - Accurate visualization of narrative branches and consequences
  - Proper modeling of character traits and relationships
  - Correct persistence and triggering of world state events
  - Accurate analysis of economy balance and progression curves

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Narrative designer creates branching quest line with multiple endings
  - Character designer defines personality traits affecting dialogue options
  - World builder creates persistent world changes based on player achievements
  - Economy designer balances resource distribution across player levels
  - QA tester validates quest dependencies for progression blockers

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Process a narrative structure with 500+ dialogue nodes in under 10 seconds
  - Update character states for 100+ NPCs in under 50ms
  - Evaluate 200+ world state triggers in under 5ms
  - Simulate economy progression for 100 hours of gameplay in under 2 minutes

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling of circular quest dependencies
  - Detection of unreachable narrative branches
  - Management of conflicting character traits in interaction systems
  - Identification of progression dead-ends in complex quest networks
  - Economy analysis under extreme player behavior patterns

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
  - 100% coverage of DSL parser and interpreter
  - 100% coverage of quest dependency validation
  - 95% coverage of economy balancing algorithms

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
