# Multi-Tenant SaaS Microservices Framework

## Overview
This project is a specialized event-driven microservices framework designed for multi-tenant SaaS applications. It focuses on tenant isolation, resource efficiency, and dynamic scaling while providing tools for tenant-specific configuration, usage analytics, and service cost attribution to support diverse business customers with varying needs and usage patterns.

## Persona Description
Jamal manages a multi-tenant SaaS application serving thousands of business customers with varying usage patterns. His primary goal is to implement a microservices architecture that enables tenant isolation while efficiently sharing infrastructure and scaling individual components based on tenant-specific demands.

## Key Requirements

1. **Tenant-aware Event Routing with Data Isolation Guarantees**
   - Implement tenant context propagation across all service boundaries
   - Create tenant-specific event routing rules and channels
   - Ensure strict data isolation between tenants in shared services
   - Include data access auditing for security verification
   - This feature is critical to maintain data privacy and prevent tenant data leakage while efficiently sharing infrastructure

2. **Per-tenant Rate Limiting and Quota Enforcement**
   - Develop configurable rate limiting on a per-tenant basis
   - Create quota management for resource consumption (API calls, storage, compute)
   - Support for graduated quota tiers based on subscription levels
   - Include throttling policies with degradation rather than denial
   - This feature prevents resource monopolization by individual tenants and ensures fair service for all customers

3. **Tenant-specific Configuration with Dynamic Service Composition**
   - Implement tenant-specific feature flags and configuration management
   - Create a dynamic service composition based on tenant entitlements
   - Support for tenant-specific service customizations and extensions
   - Include configuration versioning and controlled rollout capability
   - This feature enables customized service offerings while maintaining a common codebase

4. **Tenant Usage Analytics with Service-level Cost Attribution**
   - Develop detailed usage tracking across all microservices
   - Create tenant-level cost attribution for shared resources
   - Support for resource utilization forecasting and anomaly detection
   - Include billing integration points for usage-based pricing models
   - This feature provides visibility into tenant behavior and supports accurate cost allocation

5. **Multi-tenancy Patterns with Service Instance Pooling Strategies**
   - Implement resource pooling with tenant affinity where appropriate
   - Create tenant isolation models from shared to dedicated based on needs
   - Support for dynamic resource allocation based on tenant activity
   - Include tenant migration between pools without service interruption
   - This feature optimizes resource utilization while supporting varying tenant requirements

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Support for simulating multiple tenant workloads in isolation and combination
- Ability to verify tenant isolation guarantees
- Testing of rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Verification of tenant-specific configurations and service composition

### Performance Expectations
- Support for at least 10,000 concurrent tenants
- Maximum tenant-specific configuration application latency of 100ms
- Ability to process 1,000+ events per second per active tenant
- Support for instantaneous scaling based on tenant demand

### Integration Points
- Integration with identity and authentication systems (OAuth, SAML, etc.)
- Support for tenant onboarding and management systems
- Compatibility with billing and subscription management services
- Integration with analytics and monitoring platforms

### Key Constraints
- Must maintain strict tenant data isolation
- Must support varying tenant workloads efficiently
- Must operate within cost-effective resource utilization parameters
- Must provide tenant transparency for resource usage and billing

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The framework must provide:

1. **Multi-tenant Event Processing**
   - Tenant context propagation across services
   - Tenant-aware event routing and handling
   - Data isolation enforcement
   - Cross-tenant event correlation where permitted

2. **Resource Management and Control**
   - Rate limiting and quota enforcement
   - Tenant resource allocation and tracking
   - Dynamic scaling based on tenant demand
   - Resource pooling strategies

3. **Tenant Configuration Management**
   - Tenant-specific configuration storage and retrieval
   - Feature flag management
   - Dynamic service composition
   - Configuration versioning and deployment

4. **Usage Analytics and Tracking**
   - Tenant activity monitoring
   - Resource usage tracking and attribution
   - Cost allocation for shared resources
   - Usage pattern analysis and forecasting

5. **Tenant Lifecycle Management**
   - Tenant onboarding and offboarding
   - Tenant data migration
   - Service level agreement enforcement
   - Tenant health monitoring

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities that Must be Verified
- Tenant data isolation across all services
- Accurate rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Correct application of tenant-specific configurations
- Proper resource usage tracking and attribution
- Effective service instance pooling

### Critical User Scenarios
- Tenant onboarding with custom configuration
- High-volume usage by specific tenants without impacting others
- Tenant configuration changes without service interruption
- Quota threshold management with graceful degradation
- Cost attribution for complex service interactions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Support concurrent operation of 10,000+ tenants
- Process 1,000+ events per second per tenant
- Apply tenant configuration changes in under 100ms
- Track and attribute costs for 1M+ operations per hour

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Tenant resource exhaustion handling
- Cross-tenant data access attempts
- Configuration conflicts between tenant requirements
- Extreme usage pattern variations
- Tenant service degradation without complete outage

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all code
- 100% coverage of tenant isolation mechanisms
- 100% coverage of rate limiting and quota enforcement
- 100% coverage of tenant configuration management

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. The system maintains complete tenant data isolation
2. Resource usage is properly controlled and limited on a per-tenant basis
3. Tenant-specific configurations are correctly applied
4. Usage is accurately tracked and attributed to the correct tenants
5. Resource pooling optimizes infrastructure while meeting tenant needs
6. Performance meets the specified benchmarks under multi-tenant load
7. All test cases pass with the required coverage

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

### Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the project in development mode
uv pip install -e .

# Install test dependencies
uv pip install pytest pytest-json-report

# Run tests and generate the required JSON report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

CRITICAL: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a mandatory requirement for project completion. This file serves as evidence that all functionality has been implemented correctly and passes all tests.
