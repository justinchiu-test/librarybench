# Cloud Storage Migration Analyzer

A specialized file system analyzer tailored for cloud migration planning and optimization.

## Overview

The Cloud Storage Migration Analyzer is a Python library that helps cloud migration specialists analyze on-premises storage usage patterns to plan efficient, cost-effective cloud deployments. It provides tools for comparing existing storage with cloud storage options, identifying migration complexities, supporting hybrid environments, detecting application-specific patterns, and analyzing data access patterns to inform strategic migration decisions.

## Persona Description

Aisha helps organizations migrate on-premises infrastructure to cloud platforms. She needs to analyze existing storage usage to plan efficient and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## Key Requirements

1. **Cloud Cost Projection Tools**: 
   Functionality to compare on-premises storage with equivalent cloud storage tiers. This is critical for Aisha as accurate cost projections allow her to create compelling business cases for migration and ensure budgets are properly allocated. The system must analyze current storage costs and project equivalent costs across different cloud providers and storage tiers.

2. **Migration Complexity Scoring**:
   Algorithms to identify data that may be challenging to transfer due to size, structure, or dependencies. This feature is essential because it allows Aisha to proactively identify potential migration bottlenecks and allocate resources appropriately. Complex migrations require additional planning and specialized transfer strategies.

3. **Hybrid Environment Analysis**:
   Tools for analyzing phased migrations with data dependencies between cloud and on-premises systems. This capability is crucial during transition periods when organizations operate in hybrid mode. Aisha needs to understand cross-environment dependencies to prevent application failures and ensure data consistency.

4. **Application-Specific Storage Pattern Detection**:
   Mechanisms to match appropriate cloud storage services (block, object, file) based on detected application usage patterns. This is vital for optimizing both performance and cost in the cloud environment. Different applications have distinct I/O patterns that perform better with specific cloud storage types.

5. **Data Gravity Analysis**:
   Analytics to identify which datasets attract the most access and processing requirements. This feature is essential for planning the migration sequence and architecture. "Data gravity" affects where applications should be hosted and which datasets should be migrated first to minimize disruption and network costs.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be designed with clear interfaces that can be tested independently
- Storage scanning modules must support mock filesystem interfaces for testing
- Cloud cost projection algorithms must accept standardized input formats for consistent testing
- Migration complexity scoring must be testable with predefined datasets of varying complexity
- Test suites must cover at least 90% of code with unit and integration tests

### Performance Expectations
- File system scanning must process at least 100,000 files per minute on standard hardware
- Analysis operations must scale linearly with dataset size
- Memory usage must not exceed 500MB for analyzing filesystems up to 10TB
- Cloud cost projection calculations must complete in under 30 seconds for systems with up to 1 million files
- API endpoints must respond in under 200ms for standard queries

### Integration Points
- Cloud provider cost APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) for accurate pricing information
- Standard filesystem access interfaces for on-premises storage analysis
- Export capabilities to common formats (JSON, CSV, Excel) for reporting
- Possible integration with cloud migration tools via well-defined APIs
- Optional integration with infrastructure-as-code tools for provisioning recommendations

### Key Constraints
- All operations must be non-destructive and read-only to ensure data safety
- Analysis should minimize impact on production systems by controlling I/O rates
- Authentication and encryption must be used for all cloud provider API interactions
- The implementation must handle incremental updates to avoid full rescans
- Solutions must work across Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Cloud Storage Migration Analyzer must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Storage Inventory and Classification**:
   - Recursive directory scanning with metadata collection
   - File type identification and grouping
   - Storage usage pattern analysis
   - Time-based access pattern detection
   - Data classification by content type

2. **Cloud Cost Analysis Engine**:
   - Multi-cloud pricing model integration
   - Storage tier recommendation algorithms
   - TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) comparison
   - Long-term storage cost projections
   - Storage class transition recommendations

3. **Migration Planning Framework**:
   - Complexity scoring based on size, relationships, and structure
   - Migration phase planning with dependency resolution
   - Transfer time estimation based on size and available bandwidth
   - Risk assessment for data transfer operations
   - Prioritization recommendations for migration sequence

4. **Storage Pattern Detection**:
   - I/O pattern analysis (sequential vs. random access)
   - Block size optimization recommendations
   - Read/write ratio analysis
   - Application storage behavior fingerprinting
   - Matching patterns to optimal cloud storage types

5. **Data Relationship Mapping**:
   - Dependency detection between data sets
   - Access frequency and patterns tracking
   - Cross-reference between data and applications
   - Data "temperature" analysis (hot vs. cold data)
   - Network traffic projections for different architecture options

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify

### Critical User Scenarios
- Full storage assessment of an enterprise environment with varied data types

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
