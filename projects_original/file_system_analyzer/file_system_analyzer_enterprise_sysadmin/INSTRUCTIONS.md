# Enterprise Storage Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive file system analyzer for proactive enterprise storage management and capacity planning.

## Overview

The Enterprise Storage Intelligence Platform is a Python library designed to help enterprise systems administrators proactively monitor, analyze, and manage storage infrastructure across large-scale environments. It provides automated scanning, cross-server aggregation, monitoring system integration, role-based access controls, and predictive analytics to prevent capacity-related outages and optimize storage resource allocation.

## Persona Description

Alex is a senior systems administrator managing storage infrastructure for a multinational corporation with hundreds of servers. His primary goal is to proactively identify storage trends and prevent capacity-related outages before they impact business operations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automated Scheduled Scanning**:
   Implementation of configurable scheduled scanning with flexible retention policies for historical data. This is critical for Alex because it enables continuous monitoring without manual intervention across hundreds of servers. The system must support configurable scan frequencies, depth levels, and retention periods for different server types and importance levels.

2. **Cross-Server Aggregation Dashboard**:
   Development of a data aggregation system that consolidates storage metrics across the entire infrastructure. This feature is essential because it provides a holistic view of storage utilization across distributed environments. Alex needs to identify enterprise-wide patterns, compare utilization across similar systems, and understand storage distribution across business units and applications.

3. **Monitoring Platform Integration**:
   Implementation of integration interfaces with enterprise monitoring platforms (Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana) for unified alerting. This capability is crucial for maintaining a consolidated view of infrastructure health. Alex needs storage metrics to flow into existing monitoring systems to leverage established alerting workflows and avoid monitoring silos.

4. **Role-Based Access Controls**:
   Development of a permission system allowing junior admins view-only access to reports without modification privileges. This is vital for team collaboration while maintaining security. Alex needs to delegate monitoring tasks to junior staff while restricting configuration changes and ensuring sensitive data access is appropriately controlled.

5. **Predictive Analytics**:
   Implementation of forecasting algorithms to predict future storage requirements based on historical growth patterns. This feature is essential for proactive capacity planning and hardware procurement. Alex needs to identify capacity issues weeks or months before they become critical and generate accurate forecasts for budgeting and purchasing cycles.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have well-defined interfaces that can be tested independently
- Mock storage systems must be supported for testing without actual infrastructure
- Predictive algorithms must be testable against historical datasets with known outcomes
- Test coverage must exceed 90% for all core functionality
- Integration points must support mock implementations for isolated testing

### Performance Expectations
- Scan operations must scale linearly with filesystem size
- Aggregation operations must complete in under 5 minutes for environments with 500+ servers
- Dashboard data retrieval must complete in under 2 seconds
- Predictive calculations must complete in under 1 minute per server
- Memory usage must not exceed 1GB during standard operations

### Integration Points
- Standard filesystem access interfaces (local and remote)
- Monitoring system API integration (Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Alert notification channels (email, SMS, ticketing systems)

- Export capabilities for reports and forecasts (JSON, CSV, Excel)

### Key Constraints
- All operations must be non-destructive and primarily read-only
- Scanning must not impact production system performance
- Implementation must work across heterogeneous environments (Windows, Linux, various storage technologies)
- Security and access controls must meet enterprise standards
- Solution must be scalable from dozens to thousands of servers

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Enterprise Storage Intelligence Platform must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Advanced Scanning Framework**:
   - Configurable recursive directory scanning
   - File classification and categorization
   - Metadata extraction and indexing
   - Incremental scanning for efficiency
   - Distributed scanning orchestration

2. **Enterprise Data Aggregation**:
   - Cross-server metric consolidation
   - Hierarchical data organization (business unit, application, server)
   - Trend analysis across server groups
   - Anomaly detection in utilization patterns
   - Historical data management with retention policies

3. **Monitoring System Integration**:
   - Standard monitoring protocol support (SNMP, REST)
   - Custom metric definition and export
   - Threshold-based alert configuration
   - Health status indicators and dashboards
   - Bi-directional integration with existing systems

4. **Access Control System**:
   - Role definition and permission management
   - Authentication integration with enterprise systems
   - Audit logging of all access and operations
   - Data visibility controls by organizational structure
   - Delegation of specific administrative functions

5. **Predictive Intelligence Engine**:
   - Growth trend analysis using statistical models
   - Seasonality detection in storage patterns
   - Anomaly filtering for prediction accuracy
   - Confidence interval calculations for forecasts
   - Procurement recommendation generation

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy and reliability of automated scanning
- Correctness of cross-server data aggregation
- Functionality of monitoring system integration
- Effectiveness of role-based access controls
- Precision of predictive growth forecasts

### Critical User Scenarios
- Enterprise-wide storage assessment with hundreds of servers
- Trending analysis across multiple business units

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
