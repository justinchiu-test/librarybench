# Legal Discovery File System Navigator

A specialized file system analyzer for e-discovery operations and legal document management.

## Overview

The Legal Discovery File System Navigator is a Python library designed to help legal discovery specialists efficiently search through massive corporate archives, identify relevant documents, and export them while maintaining chain of custody. It provides advanced query capabilities, legally defensible exports, duplicate detection, timeline visualization, and legal document management system integration.

## Persona Description

Jessica works for a law firm handling e-discovery requests that require searching through massive corporate archives. She needs to efficiently identify and export relevant documents while maintaining chain of custody.

## Key Requirements

1. **Advanced Query Language**:
   Implementation of a sophisticated query system for complex file selection combining metadata and content patterns. This is critical for Jessica because it enables precise targeting of relevant documents within massive archives. The system must support Boolean logic, proximity searches, date ranges, file type filtering, and content-based criteria to efficiently narrow down document sets for legal review.

2. **Legally Defensible Export Functionality**:
   Tools to export document sets with complete chain of custody documentation. This feature is essential because legal proceedings require proof that evidence has not been tampered with. Jessica needs comprehensive metadata recording who accessed files, when they were exported, and cryptographic verification that the content remains unaltered.

3. **Duplicate Detection System**:
   Algorithms specifically designed to identify near-identical documents with minor variations. This capability is crucial for reducing review workload in cases with massive document sets. Jessica needs to identify substantive duplicates even when documents have formatting changes, minor edits, or have been converted between formats.

4. **Timeline Visualization**:
   Visual representation of document creation, modification, and access patterns relevant to case timeframes. This is vital for establishing chronology in legal cases. Jessica needs to understand document lifecycle events within the context of case-relevant dates to establish timelines of activity and identify potential spoliation issues.

5. **Legal Document Management Integration**:
   Seamless interfaces with specialized legal document management systems. This feature is essential for maintaining workflow efficiency. Jessica needs to transfer discovered documents directly into the firm's document management system, preserving all metadata and relationships for attorney review without manual re-entry of information.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have well-defined interfaces that can be independently tested
- Query language parsing must be rigorously tested with diverse query scenarios
- Chain of custody mechanisms must have verifiable integrity checks
- Document comparison algorithms must be testable against known similar/different pairs
- Integration points must support mock implementations for isolated testing

### Performance Expectations
- Searches must be responsive on archives with 10+ million documents
- Export operations should process at least 10,000 documents per hour
- Duplicate detection should compare at least 5,000 document pairs per minute
- Timeline visualization must render in under 5 seconds for 10,000+ documents
- Memory usage should not exceed 2GB during standard operations

### Integration Points
- Standard filesystem access interfaces (local and network storage)
- Document management systems via standard APIs
- Export interfaces for producing standard legal formats (EDRM XML, load files)
- Authentication systems for user tracking and access logging
- Optional integration with court filing systems

### Key Constraints
- All operations must be non-destructive and primarily read-only
- Chain of custody must be maintained for all operations
- Original file timestamps and metadata must be preserved
- Operations must be logged with sufficient detail for audit trails
- System must operate within data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

   - Metadata-based filtering (dates, authors, types)
   - Content-based search with context awareness
   - Search result management and refinement

2. **Chain of Custody Framework**:
   - Comprehensive action logging and timestamping
   - Cryptographic hashing for document verification
   - Access tracking and authorization enforcement
   - Immutable audit trail generation
   - Evidence package preparation for proceedings

3. **Document Similarity Analysis**:
   - Near-duplicate detection algorithms
   - Variation identification and classification
   - Document clustering by similarity
   - Version history reconstruction
   - Hierarchical relationship mapping

4. **Temporal Analysis System**:
   - Document timeline construction and visualization
   - Activity pattern detection within case periods
   - Anomaly detection in document chronology
   - Custodian activity correlation
   - Event sequence reconstruction

5. **Legal Systems Integration Layer**:
   - Standard connector interfaces for document management systems
   - Metadata mapping and preservation
   - Batch export with load file generation
   - Classification and tagging synchronization
   - Review status tracking

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy and completeness of document query results
- Integrity of chain of custody documentation
- Precision of duplicate and near-duplicate detection
- Accuracy of timeline construction and visualization
- Reliability of legal system integration

### Critical User Scenarios
- Early case assessment with preliminary searches
- Document production for discovery requests
- Identifying potential spoliation of evidence
- Chronological analysis of key case events
- Transfer of responsive documents to review platform

### Performance Benchmarks
- Query completion in under 10 seconds for standard complexity
- Processing of 1 million documents in under 4 hours
- Duplicate detection across 100,000 documents in under 1 hour
- Timeline generation in under 5 seconds for 10,000 documents
- Export package preparation at 10,000 documents per hour

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of corrupt or partially accessible files
- Recovery from interrupted export operations
- Proper processing of unusual file formats
- Handling inconsistent or missing metadata
- Appropriate response to access permission restrictions

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% code coverage for chain of custody components
- 90% code coverage for all other modules
- Explicit testing of all error handling pathways
- Performance tests for all resource-intensive operations
- Compatibility tests for supported legal system integrations

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
