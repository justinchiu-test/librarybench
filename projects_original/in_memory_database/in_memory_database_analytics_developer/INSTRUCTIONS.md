# AnalyticaDB: In-Memory Database for Real-Time Analytics Dashboards

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database optimized for real-time analytics dashboards that efficiently supports concurrent analytical queries, implements materialized views with incremental updates, provides time-window caching, delivers progressive query results, and ensures multi-tenant isolation to deliver responsive business intelligence visualizations without impacting transactional performance.

## Persona Description
Elena builds interactive dashboards for business intelligence showing live data. She needs to support concurrent analytical queries without impacting transactional performance.

## Key Requirements

1. **Materialized View Maintenance with Incremental Updates**
   - Implementation of materialized views that automatically update as underlying data changes
   - Support for efficient incremental updates rather than full recalculation
   - Dependency tracking between base tables and derived views
   - This feature is critical for Elena as dashboard queries often involve complex aggregations that would be too expensive to compute on demand, while materialized views with incremental updates provide near real-time results without the performance cost of repeated calculations

2. **Time-Window Caching for Report Periods**
   - Implementation of intelligent caching strategies optimized for common time-based report periods
   - Support for configurable, sliding time windows with automatic invalidation
   - Pre-aggregation of metrics for standard reporting intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Business dashboards frequently analyze data over standard time periods, and caching these results significantly improves dashboard responsiveness for Elena's users while reducing system load during peak usage

3. **Progressive Query Results**
   - Implementation of a progressive query execution system that returns approximate results before final computation
   - Support for confidence intervals or error bounds on partial results
   - Progressive refinement of results as computation continues
   - Interactive dashboards benefit from immediate feedback, making progressive results essential for Elena to create responsive user experiences even when queries involve large datasets or complex calculations

4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
   - Implementation of resource isolation to prevent one dashboard's queries from impacting others
   - Support for per-tenant resource limits and query prioritization
   - Performance monitoring and automatic throttling to maintain system stability
   - Elena's dashboards serve multiple business units with varying workloads, requiring strong isolation to ensure that demanding queries from one tenant don't degrade performance for others

5. **Visual Query Builder Integration**
   - Implementation of a query cost estimation system that predicts execution time and resource usage
   - Support for query plan visualization and optimization suggestions
   - Compatibility with common dashboard query patterns and abstractions
   - Integration with visual query builders allows Elena to help business users construct efficient queries while providing feedback on expected performance before execution, preventing problematic queries from impacting the system

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Materialized view accuracy must be verifiable against direct calculations
- Caching efficiency must be measurable with different query patterns
- Progressive query accuracy must be testable at different execution stages
- Multi-tenant isolation must be demonstrable under concurrent load
- Query cost estimation must be benchmarkable against actual execution

### Performance Expectations
- Materialized view updates should complete in under 100ms for typical data changes
- Cached time-window queries should return in under 50ms
- Initial progressive results should be available within 100ms of query start
- System should support at least 100 concurrent dashboard users
- Query cost estimation should be within 20% accuracy of actual execution time

### Integration Points
- Compatible interfaces with popular visualization tools
- Query language support for common BI operations
- Export capabilities for offline analysis
- Notification mechanisms for data freshness and updates
- APIs for dashboard state management

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must use only Python standard library with no external dependencies
- The system must operate efficiently within typical analytics server resource allocations
- All query operations must have predictable and bounded resource usage
- The solution must maintain data consistency during view maintenance

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Analytical Query Engine**
   - Efficient processing of aggregation and grouping operations
   - Support for complex analytical functions
   - Optimization for common dashboard query patterns

2. **Materialized View System**
   - Definition and maintenance of derived data views
   - Incremental update mechanisms
   - Dependency tracking and invalidation management

3. **Caching Framework**
   - Time-based caching strategies
   - Pre-aggregation for standard reporting periods
   - Cache invalidation and refresh mechanisms

4. **Progressive Execution Engine**
   - Algorithms for approximate query processing
   - Confidence interval calculation for partial results
   - Progressive refinement of result accuracy

5. **Resource Management System**
   - Multi-tenant isolation mechanisms
   - Resource allocation and query prioritization
   - Monitoring and automatic throttling

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of materialized views after data changes
- Efficiency of time-window cache for common report periods
- Convergence of progressive query results to exact answers
- Effective isolation between multi-tenant workloads
- Accuracy of query cost estimation for complex operations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Interactive dashboard exploration with sub-second response times
- Concurrent usage by multiple business units
- Real-time updates as underlying data changes
- Complex analytical queries across large datasets
- Dashboard performance during peak usage periods

### Performance Benchmarks
- Materialized view updates should complete in under 100ms for typical data changes
- Cached time-window queries should return in under 50ms
- Initial progressive results should be available within 100ms of query start
- The system should maintain responsiveness with 100+ concurrent users
- Query execution time should not vary more than 20% between identical runs

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Behavior under heavy concurrent load
- Recovery from interruptions during view maintenance
- Performance with extremely complex analytical queries
- System stability with unpredictable query patterns
- Resource management during peak usage periods

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of materialized view maintenance code
- All multi-tenant isolation mechanisms must be tested
- Performance tests must cover common dashboard scenarios
- Progressive query accuracy must be verified at multiple stages

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Materialized views correctly maintain accuracy with efficient incremental updates
2. Time-window caching significantly improves performance for common report periods
3. Progressive queries provide useful approximations that converge to exact results
4. Multi-tenant workloads remain isolated without performance interference
5. Query cost estimation provides accurate predictions of execution time and resource usage

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
5. Run tests with:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

CRITICAL REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a MANDATORY requirement for project completion.
