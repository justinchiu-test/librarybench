# GameState DB: In-Memory Database for Game Development

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database designed for game development that excels at storing complex game objects, managing spatial data, implementing checkpoint systems, supporting progressive loading, and optimizing memory usage. This database focuses on minimizing save/load times while providing efficient access patterns for game worlds and player state.

## Persona Description
Yulia creates mobile and desktop games that need to persist player state and game world data. She requires a database solution that minimizes save/load times while supporting complex game object relationships.

## Key Requirements

1. **Object Serialization for Complex Game Entities**
   - Implementation of an efficient serialization system optimized for complex nested game objects
   - Support for class inheritance hierarchies and polymorphic object storage
   - Fast serialization and deserialization with minimal overhead
   - This feature is critical for Yulia as games involve intricate object models with inheritance and inter-object references that must be quickly saved and loaded without disrupting gameplay or causing visual stutters

2. **Spatial Indexing for Game World Queries**
   - Implementation of spatial indexing structures (quadtrees, R-trees, etc.) for efficient location-based queries
   - Support for common spatial query patterns (point, range, nearest-neighbor, etc.)
   - Optimized for frequent updates of entity positions
   - Games frequently need to query entities based on spatial relationships (e.g., "find all enemies within 30 units" or "what items are in this room?"), making efficient spatial indexing essential for maintaining performance as game worlds scale

3. **Automatic State Checkpointing**
   - Implementation of an automatic state checkpointing system with minimal performance impact
   - Support for full and incremental checkpoints at configurable intervals
   - Fast restore capabilities from any saved checkpoint
   - Games need reliable save systems that preserve player progress without interrupting gameplay, making efficient checkpointing a core requirement for positive player experiences

4. **Progressive Loading for Large Game Worlds**
   - Implementation of a progressive loading system that prioritizes entities by proximity or relevance
   - Support for background loading to minimize visible loading screens
   - Configurable loading strategies based on platform capabilities
   - Large game worlds cannot fit entirely in memory, requiring smart loading strategies that bring in relevant portions of the world as needed while maintaining game responsiveness

5. **Memory Footprint Optimization**
   - Implementation of configurable compression for different asset types
   - Memory usage monitoring and optimization strategies
   - Automatic memory management to stay within platform constraints
   - Games must operate within strict memory limits, especially on mobile platforms, making memory optimization crucial for stable performance and wider device compatibility

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Serialization performance must be measurable in automated tests
- Spatial indexing accuracy and performance must be verifiable
- Checkpoint integrity must be testable under various failure scenarios
- Progressive loading must be analyzable for performance characteristics
- Memory optimization strategies must show measurable improvements

### Performance Expectations
- Save/load operations must complete in under 100ms for typical game states
- Spatial queries must return results in under 5ms for common game world sizes
- Checkpoint creation should have no visible impact on frame rate
- Progressive loading should maintain 60+ FPS while loading new content
- Memory optimizations should reduce footprint by at least 30% compared to naive storage

### Integration Points
- Clean API for game engine integration (Unity, Unreal, custom engines)
- Support for standard game object models and inheritance patterns
- Hooks for custom serialization of engine-specific types
- Event system for notifying game systems of data changes

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must use only Python standard library with no external dependencies
- All operations must be optimized for real-time performance requirements
- The system must be resilient to unexpected termination (crash, power loss)
- The solution must scale from small mobile games to large open-world environments

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Game Object Database**
   - Schema support for complex game entities and their relationships
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of game objects by ID or attributes
   - Transaction support for atomic updates to game state

2. **Object Serialization System**
   - Fast serialization/deserialization of complex object hierarchies
   - Support for inheritance and polymorphism in object models
   - Handling of circular references and shared objects

3. **Spatial Index Engine**
   - Implementation of spatial data structures for 2D and 3D worlds
   - Efficient spatial query operations for common game patterns
   - Dynamic updating as entities move through the game world

4. **Checkpoint and Restore System**
   - Automatic generation of game state checkpoints
   - Efficient storage of incremental and full checkpoint data
   - Fast restoration from any checkpoint

5. **Memory Management System**
   - Compression strategies for different game asset types
   - Memory usage tracking and optimization
   - Progressive loading and unloading of game world data

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Correct serialization and deserialization of complex game objects
- Accurate spatial queries with various entity distributions
- Reliable checkpoint creation and restoration
- Effective progressive loading with prioritization
- Measurable memory optimization benefits

### Critical User Scenarios
- Saving and loading complete game states
- Finding nearby entities in a densely populated game world
- Recovering from a checkpoint after unexpected termination
- Seamlessly transitioning between game world areas
- Operating within memory constraints on limited hardware

### Performance Benchmarks
- Serialization must process at least 10,000 typical game objects per second
- Spatial queries must return results in under 5ms for worlds with 10,000+ entities
- Checkpoint creation must complete in under 50ms for typical game states
- Progressive loading must maintain 60+ FPS while loading new content
- Memory optimizations must reduce footprint by at least 30% compared to naive storage

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Recovery from corrupted save data
- Behavior when memory limits are reached
- Performance with extremely large game worlds
- Handling of malformed object data
- Operation during system resource contention

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of serialization and checkpoint code
- All error recovery paths must be tested
- Performance tests must cover typical and worst-case scenarios
- Memory optimization benefits must be quantifiable

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Game objects are correctly serialized and deserialized with high performance
2. Spatial indexing accurately and efficiently supports common game query patterns
3. Checkpoints reliably preserve game state with minimal performance impact
4. Progressive loading maintains smooth gameplay while bringing in new content
5. Memory optimizations show measurable benefits for different game asset types

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
5. Run tests with:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

CRITICAL REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a MANDATORY requirement for project completion.
