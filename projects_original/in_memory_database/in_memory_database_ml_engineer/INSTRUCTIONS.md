# VectorDB: Vector-Optimized In-Memory Database for ML Applications

## Overview
A specialized in-memory database optimized for machine learning feature storage and retrieval that provides efficient vector operations, feature versioning, batch prediction support, automatic feature transformations, and A/B testing capabilities to accelerate ML inference workflows while ensuring data consistency.

## Persona Description
Wei builds prediction systems that need to quickly access feature data during inference. He requires efficient storage of model features with specialized query patterns for machine learning operations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Vector Data Types with Optimized Distance Calculations**
   - Implementation of native vector data types optimized for common distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine, Manhattan, etc.)
   - Support for efficient nearest-neighbor queries on high-dimensional vectors
   - Indexing structures optimized for similarity searches (e.g., approximate nearest neighbors)
   - This feature is critical for Wei as many ML models operate on vector embeddings, requiring fast similarity searches and efficient storage of high-dimensional data to enable real-time recommendations, classification, and retrieval tasks

2. **Feature Store with Versioning and Lineage**
   - Implementation of a feature store that tracks data lineage and transformation history
   - Support for feature versioning to ensure reproducibility of model predictions
   - Historical feature value access for debugging and auditing
   - ML systems require reproducibility and auditability, making feature versioning and lineage tracking essential for Wei to understand how feature values were derived and to ensure consistent model behavior across development and production

3. **Batch Prediction Optimization**
   - Implementation of vectorized data retrieval optimized for batch inference scenarios
   - Support for efficient loading of features for multiple prediction requests
   - Parallelized feature transformations for high-throughput prediction pipelines
   - Batch prediction is a common pattern in ML systems that can significantly improve throughput, requiring specialized optimization to efficiently retrieve and prepare feature data for multiple predictions simultaneously

4. **Automatic Feature Normalization and Transformation**
   - Implementation of configurable feature transformations that apply automatically during queries
   - Support for common ML preprocessing operations (scaling, normalization, encoding, etc.)
   - Runtime application of transformations without redundant data storage
   - ML models expect consistently preprocessed features, and automatic transformation during retrieval ensures that all data is properly prepared without requiring separate preprocessing steps or duplicate storage of raw and transformed values

5. **A/B Testing Support**
   - Implementation of randomized but consistent record selection for experimental groups
   - Support for percentage-based traffic allocation to different model variants
   - Tracking and analysis of outcomes across experimental cohorts
   - A/B testing is fundamental to improving ML systems, requiring consistent user assignment to experimental groups and reliable tracking of outcomes to evaluate model changes

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Vector operations must be benchmarkable against reference implementations
- Feature versioning must be verifiable through lineage tracking
- Batch prediction performance must be measurable under various load conditions
- Feature transformations must produce results matching standalone preprocessing
- A/B testing must demonstrate statistical properties of proper randomization

### Performance Expectations
- Vector similarity queries should return results in under 10ms for collections up to 1 million vectors
- Feature retrieval should support at least 1,000 queries per second
- Batch operations should show near-linear scaling with batch size
- Transformation overhead should not exceed 5% of base retrieval time
- A/B group assignment should add no more than 1ms overhead per query

### Integration Points
- Compatible interfaces with popular ML frameworks (sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Support for standard feature engineering pipelines
- Export capabilities for offline analysis
- Integration with model serving frameworks
- Hooks for observability and monitoring systems

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must use only Python standard library with no external dependencies
- The system must operate efficiently within typical ML serving resource allocations
- All vector operations must be numerically stable and accurate
- The solution must scale to handle common ML feature dimensionalities (hundreds to thousands)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide the following core functionality:

1. **Vector Storage and Indexing**

   - Support for common distance metrics and query patterns

2. **Feature Management System**
   - Storage of feature values with versioning and lineage
   - Efficient retrieval of features for inference
   - Historical tracking of feature evolution

3. **Batch Processing Engine**
   - Vectorized data access for multiple records
   - Parallel processing of batch requests
   - Optimization for different batch sizes and patterns

4. **Transformation Framework**
   - Runtime application of feature transformations
   - Support for common preprocessing operations
   - Configuration of transformation pipelines

5. **Experimentation System**
   - Consistent assignment of entities to experimental groups
   - Control over traffic allocation percentages
   - Support for collecting and analyzing experimental results

- Batch operations should demonstrate at least 5x throughput improvement over individual queries
- Transformation overhead should not exceed 5% of base retrieval time

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Behavior with extremely high-dimensional vectors
- Handling of missing or corrupt feature values
- Performance with skewed data distributions
- Consistency during concurrent updates
- Resource usage under high query loads

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of vector operation and distance calculation code
- All transformation pipelines must be tested for correctness
- Performance tests must cover various vector dimensions and batch sizes
- A/B testing must be verified for statistical correctness

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Vector operations efficiently support similarity searches and nearest neighbor queries
2. Feature versioning correctly tracks lineage and enables reproducible predictions
3. Batch operations demonstrate significant performance improvements over individual queries
4. Feature transformations produce correctly preprocessed data for models
5. A/B testing provides consistent group assignment with proper statistical properties

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
5. Run tests with:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

CRITICAL REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a MANDATORY requirement for project completion.
