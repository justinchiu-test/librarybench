# Ultra-Low Latency In-Memory Database for Financial Trading Systems

## Overview
A specialized high-performance in-memory database optimized for financial trading operations, providing microsecond-level response times for market data queries, trade execution, and risk calculations. This system prioritizes extreme low-latency access patterns while maintaining ACID compliance for critical financial transactions.

## Persona Description
Sarah develops algorithms for a quantitative trading firm where milliseconds matter in market analysis. Her primary goal is to minimize data access latency for real-time financial calculations while maintaining transactional integrity for trading operations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Microsecond-Level Performance Benchmarking Tools**
   - Implementation of precise internal timing mechanisms to measure query execution at the microsecond level
   - Detailed performance analysis reporting to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in query execution
   - Comprehensive benchmarking framework to compare performance across different database operations
   - This feature is critical for Sarah to identify and optimize database operations that might impact trading decisions, where even microseconds can result in significant financial differences

2. **Specialized Numeric Data Types with Precision Control**
   - Support for decimal data types with configurable precision for monetary values
   - Implementation of fixed-point arithmetic to eliminate floating-point errors in financial calculations
   - Optimized storage for market data with proper decimal rounding strategies
   - Sarah requires absolute precision in financial calculations as even small rounding errors can compound into significant discrepancies in trading algorithms

3. **Time-Series Optimizations for Market Data**
   - Highly efficient timestamp-based indexing optimized for time-range queries on market data
   - Specialized storage layouts for tick data that optimize sequential time-series access patterns
   - Query optimizations specifically for time-interval and latest-point lookups
   - Market data analysis requires rapid access to both historical trends and current prices, making time-series optimization essential for Sarah's algorithms

4. **Memory Usage Throttling and Resource Management**
   - Configurable memory limits to prevent system resource exhaustion during market volatility
   - Automatic memory usage monitoring with adaptive query optimization under high load
   - Priority-based execution to ensure critical trading operations are never blocked
   - During market volatility, data volumes can spike dramatically, and Sarah needs guarantees that the system will remain stable while prioritizing the most important operations

5. **Circuit-Breaker Patterns for System Stability**
   - Implementation of circuit-breaker patterns to detect and prevent cascading failures
   - Configurable failure thresholds with automatic recovery mechanisms
   - Partial degradation modes that maintain critical functionality during extreme conditions
   - Trading systems must remain operational even during extreme market conditions, making system stability a fundamental requirement for Sarah's applications

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Each component must have comprehensive benchmark tests showing microsecond-level performance metrics
- Tests must include scenarios with simulated market volatility and high data volumes
- Performance tests must validate behavior under various load conditions
- Isolation tests must confirm transactional integrity during concurrent operations

### Performance Expectations
- Query response time for common market data operations must be under 100 microseconds at p99
- Transaction processing must maintain ACID properties while still completing within 500 microseconds
- System must handle at least 100,000 market data updates per second

### Critical User Scenarios
- High-frequency market data updates with simultaneous query operations
- Complex financial calculations across multiple data points
- Sudden spikes in trading volume during market events
- Recovery from simulated system failures
- Long-running operations that must not impact system responsiveness

### Performance Benchmarks
- Query latency must remain under 100 microseconds at p99 for point lookups
- System must handle at least 100,000 market data updates per second
- Memory usage must not increase more than 20% during 10x normal load
- Transaction commit time must be under 500 microseconds at p99
- System recovery time must be under 5 seconds after failure

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Behavior under memory exhaustion conditions
- Handling of malformed queries and data
- Recovery from partial transaction failures
- Response to corrupt or inconsistent data states
- Performance degradation patterns under extreme load

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all modules
- 100% coverage of core financial calculation functions
- All error handling paths must be tested
- Performance tests must cover all common query patterns
- Stress tests must validate system stability under extended load

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All performance benchmarks are met or exceeded
2. Financial calculations demonstrate perfect accuracy with no rounding errors
3. The system remains stable under simulated market volatility
4. Memory usage remains within configurable bounds even during extreme load
5. Circuit-breaker patterns successfully prevent cascading failures

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment using:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
5. Run tests with:
   ```
