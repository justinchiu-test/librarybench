# FamilyVault - Incremental Backup System for Household Financial Management

## Overview
A specialized incremental backup system designed for family financial managers who need to organize and secure important household documents. The system enables categorization of financial records by family member and account, secure sharing of selected documents with financial advisors, and automated version tracking of essential records while providing robust disaster recovery capabilities.

## Persona Description
Eliza manages her extended family's financial documents, including tax records, insurance policies, and estate planning documents. She needs a secure, well-organized backup system that makes it easy to retrieve specific records while ensuring nothing important is ever lost.

## Key Requirements
1. **Family Member Document Organization**: Implement a flexible organizational structure that allows documents to be categorized by family member, account, and document type in a hierarchy that matches how families actually think about their records. This capability enables Eliza to maintain a logical system that makes intuitive sense for family-based financial management, rather than forcing technical file system organization.

2. **Secure Advisor Document Sharing**: Create a mechanism for generating limited-access, time-restricted sets of documents that can be securely shared with financial advisors, tax preparers, or estate attorneys. This feature allows Eliza to provide specific professionals with exactly the documents they need, while maintaining overall privacy and restricting access to only relevant time periods.

3. **Critical Document Version Tracking**: Develop specialized handling for essential documents like wills, insurance policies, and property deeds that tracks all versions with comprehensive change logging. This ensures that Eliza can maintain a complete history of important family documents, see exactly what changed between versions, and recover specific historical versions when needed.

4. **Cross-device Synchronization**: Implement intelligent synchronization across multiple family devices with conflict resolution and bandwidth optimization. This capability allows family members to contribute to the document collection from various devices while ensuring consistent versions and preventing duplicate storage of identical documents.

5. **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Create comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities with encrypted off-site backup, recovery documentation, and emergency access protocols. This feature ensures that Eliza's family will be able to access critical financial and legal documents even in worst-case scenarios, with clear instructions for document recovery during emergencies.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have isolated unit tests with dependency injection for external systems
- Family organization schema must be tested with various family structures and document types
- Advisor sharing must be verified with access control and expiration testing
- Version tracking must be testable for document evolution and change detection
- Synchronization must be validated with simulated multi-device scenarios
- Disaster recovery must be tested with complete system restoration simulations

### Performance Expectations
- The system must efficiently handle family archives of up to 50,000 documents
- Organizational operations must complete in under 100ms for typical document management
- Advisor sharing package generation must complete within 30 seconds for 1,000 documents
- Version tracking must identify and record changes with 99.9% accuracy
- Synchronization must process changes at a rate of at least 100 documents per minute
- Disaster recovery simulations must complete within 2 hours for a complete family archive

### Integration Points
- Document scanning and capture tools
- Tax preparation software
- Estate planning and legal document systems
- Financial management applications
- Secure encrypted cloud storage services
- Multi-device synchronization protocols

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android
- All operations must maintain perfect data fidelity with original documents
- The system must accommodate both digital documents and scanned paper records
- Storage formats must be accessible for multiple decades without proprietary lock-in
- Processing must be optimized for typical home computing environments
- System must operate with strict privacy protections for sensitive family information

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Incremental Backup Engine**: A core module handling document change detection, efficient delta storage, and versioned backup creation with strong encryption and family-centric organization.

2. **Family Document Organizer**: A flexible schema system that maintains family member associations, account relationships, and intuitive categorization independent of storage structure.

3. **Advisor Access Manager**: Tools for creating temporary, limited-scope document collections that can be securely shared with specific professionals with appropriate access controls and expiration.

4. **Version Tracking System**: Sophisticated document comparison and change tracking specifically designed for critical family documents like legal and financial records.

5. **Multi-device Synchronization Framework**: Logic for efficiently keeping documents consistent across multiple family devices while resolving conflicts and optimizing bandwidth usage.

6. **Disaster Recovery Coordinator**: Comprehensive backup verification, restoration documentation, and emergency access protocol management for worst-case scenarios.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by various tools (though implementing a UI is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Family-centric organization with intuitive categorization
- Advisor sharing with proper access controls and expiration
- Version tracking with accurate change detection and history
- Multi-device synchronization with conflict resolution
- Disaster recovery with complete restoration capability
- Overall backup integrity and security

### Critical User Scenarios
- Complete family document management across life events (birth, education, marriage, etc.)
- Tax season document sharing with accountant
- Estate planning document updates with version comparison
- Recovery after device loss or failure
- Family member addition or role change
- Emergency access during unexpected situations

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial backup of a 10,000-document family archive completing in under 2 hours
- Incremental backup completing in under 5 minutes for daily updates
- Organization changes propagating in under 1 second for user experience
- Advisor package generation processing at least 50 documents per second
- Version comparison identifying changes in under 3 seconds for standard documents
- Synchronization requiring less than 10% of original document size for updates

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of corrupted or incomplete family documents
- Recovery from interrupted backups or synchronization
- Proper functioning with unusual family structures or role changes
- Correct behavior when devices have been offline for extended periods
- Appropriate handling of conflicting document changes from multiple sources
- Graceful operation during low storage or connectivity situations

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Integration tests must verify all external system interfaces

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
