# FinancialVault - Incremental Backup System for Financial Records

## Overview
A specialized incremental backup system designed for finance managers handling personal and family financial documents. The system enables intelligent classification of financial records, calendar-aware retention for tax seasons, and annual archiving capabilities while optimizing storage for document images and providing integration with personal financial software.

## Persona Description
Chen meticulously tracks personal finances and tax documents for their family. They need a reliable backup system for financial records that simplifies tax preparation and protects against data loss.

## Key Requirements
1. **Financial Document Classification**: Implement an intelligent system that automatically categorizes statements, receipts, tax forms, and other financial documents based on content analysis. This capability allows Chen to maintain a well-organized archive of financial records without manual sorting, making it much easier to find specific documents during tax preparation or financial review.

2. **Calendar-aware Retention Policies**: Create dynamic retention rules that automatically adjust based on tax seasons, filing deadlines, and regulatory requirements. This feature ensures that Chen's financial documents are kept for appropriate timeframes based on their type and relevance to upcoming tax filings, with automatic policy adjustments around key financial dates.

3. **Simplified Annual Archiving**: Develop a streamlined process for creating permanent, immutable yearly archives at the end of each tax year. This functionality provides Chen with a complete, point-in-time snapshot of all financial records relevant to a specific tax year, securely preserved for potential future audits or reference.

4. **Receipt Image Optimization**: Implement specialized handling for smartphone photos of paper receipts and documents, including perspective correction, enhancement, and OCR. This capability ensures that Chen's digitized paper documents are stored in the most useful and space-efficient format while remaining fully legible and preserving all critical information.

5. **Financial Software Integration**: Create seamless integration with personal accounting applications to back up database files, reports, and application states. This allows Chen to preserve not just financial documents but also the state of their financial software, ensuring continuity and consistency in financial record-keeping even in the event of system failure.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have isolated unit tests with dependency injection for external systems
- Document classification must be tested with various financial document formats and types
- Calendar-based policies must be verifiable through time simulation
- Annual archiving must be tested for completeness and immutability
- Image optimization must be verifiable with standardized receipt samples
- Software integration must be testable with common financial application formats

### Performance Expectations
- The system must efficiently handle personal financial archives of up to 100,000 documents
- Document classification must achieve at least 90% accuracy for common financial records
- Calendar policy applications must process rules at a rate of at least 1000 documents per minute
- Annual archiving must complete within 30 minutes for typical household finances
- Receipt optimization must process at least 5 images per second with quality improvement
- Software data integration must add less than 30 seconds overhead to backup operations

### Integration Points
- Personal finance software (Quicken, YNAB, Mint, etc.)
- Document scanning and capture tools
- OCR and image processing libraries
- Tax preparation software 
- Cloud storage providers for off-site backup
- Digital signature and verification systems

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across Windows, macOS, and mobile platforms
- All operations must maintain perfect data fidelity with original documents
- The system must accommodate both native digital documents and scanned paper records
- Storage formats must be accessible for the long term (10+ years) without proprietary dependencies
- Processing must be optimized for typical home computing environments
- System must operate with strict privacy protections for sensitive financial data

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Incremental Backup Engine**: A core module handling financial document change detection, efficient delta storage, and versioned backup creation with strong encryption capabilities.

2. **Financial Document Analyzer**: Advanced classification algorithms that categorize financial records based on content, format, issuer, and date information.

3. **Calendar-based Policy Manager**: A sophisticated rules engine that applies and adjusts retention policies based on tax deadlines, fiscal years, and regulatory requirements.

4. **Archiving System**: Tools for creating complete, verified yearly snapshots of financial records with cryptographic integrity protection and efficient storage.

5. **Receipt Optimization Framework**: Image processing capabilities specifically designed for financial documents, including perspective correction, enhancement, noise reduction, and text extraction.

6. **Financial Application Connector**: Adapters for interfacing with personal finance software to backup application data, settings, and states beyond simple file-level backup.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by various tools (though implementing a UI is not part of this project).
