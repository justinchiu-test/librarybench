# LegalVault - Incremental Backup System with Chain of Custody

## Overview
A specialized incremental backup system designed for legal professionals handling sensitive client documents. The system enables strict chain of custody for all documents, immutable legal holds to prevent modification or deletion, and comprehensive audit logging while organizing backups by case matter and implementing jurisdiction-specific retention policies.

## Persona Description
Eleanor works at a law firm handling sensitive client documents requiring strict chain of custody. She needs to maintain verifiable document history with tamper-proof audit logs for evidentiary purposes.

## Key Requirements
1. **Legal Hold Functionality**: Implement a robust mechanism to prevent modification or deletion of designated backup sets regardless of standard retention policies. This capability is critical for Eleanor to ensure that documents subject to litigation, investigation, or regulatory inquiry remain intact and unaltered until the hold is explicitly lifted with proper authorization.

2. **Chain of Custody Documentation**: Create a comprehensive, tamper-evident logging system that records all access, viewing, and restoration attempts for legal documents. This feature provides Eleanor with verifiable documentation of who accessed what documents and when, establishing an unbroken chain of custody that can withstand scrutiny in legal proceedings.

3. **Redaction-aware Backup**: Develop specialized handling for confidential content that recognizes redacted documents and applies appropriate security controls. This ensures that Eleanor can properly manage multiple versions of documents with different redaction levels, maintaining both the original unredacted versions under strict access controls and the appropriately redacted versions for broader use.

4. **Case-based Organization**: Implement a logical organization system that mirrors the firm's matter management system, allowing documents to be backed up and restored based on case relationships rather than just file system structure. This enables Eleanor to manage backups in a way that aligns with how legal professionals actually work with and think about their documents.

5. **Jurisdiction-specific Retention**: Create a configurable policy engine implementing legal requirements for different jurisdictions and practice areas with automatic enforcement. This capability ensures that Eleanor's firm meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements for document retention across different types of matters and geographical jurisdictions.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have isolated unit tests with dependency injection for external systems
- Legal hold mechanisms must be verified against unauthorized modification attempts
- Chain of custody logs must be testable for completeness and tamper-evidence
- Redaction handling must be tested with various redaction patterns and formats
- Case organization must be verifiable with different matter structures
- Retention policies must be tested against various jurisdictional requirements

### Performance Expectations
- The system must efficiently handle law firm document sets of at least 10 million files
- Legal hold application must complete within 60 seconds for matter sets up to 100,000 documents
- Chain of custody logging must add less than 50ms overhead per operation
- Redaction detection must process at least 20 documents per second
- Case organization indexing must update in under 5 seconds after document changes
- Retention policy evaluation must process at least 10,000 documents per minute

### Integration Points
- Legal practice management systems
- Document management systems used in legal settings
- Redaction and document processing tools
- Digital signature and certification services
- Secure storage with encryption capabilities
- Time-stamping authorities for verified date logging

### Key Constraints
- The implementation must work across Windows and macOS (primary law firm platforms)
- All operations must maintain cryptographic integrity verification
- The system must comply with bar association and court requirements for electronic records
- Storage formats must be technology-neutral for long-term accessibility
- Processing must be optimized to handle extremely large case files and discovery productions
- System must provide irrefutable evidence of document authenticity and handling

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core of this implementation centers on a Python library that provides:

1. **Incremental Backup Engine**: A core module handling document change detection, tamper-evident storage, and immutable version history for legal documents with cryptographic verification.

2. **Legal Hold Manager**: A robust system for designating document sets as legally protected, preventing modifications or deletions regardless of other policies, with proper authorization controls.

3. **Chain of Custody Logger**: A secure, append-only logging system that records all document interactions with cryptographic verification to ensure logs cannot be altered or fabricated.

4. **Redaction Processor**: Specialized handling for documents with redacted content, managing different versions and their appropriate access controls while maintaining original unredacted copies securely.

5. **Matter Organization System**: A logical framework mapping document backups to legal matters, clients, and practice areas independent of file system structure.

6. **Jurisdictional Policy Engine**: Configurable retention rules implementing the legal requirements of different jurisdictions, practice areas, and matter types with automatic enforcement.

The system should be designed as a collection of Python modules with clear interfaces between components, allowing them to be used independently or as an integrated solution. All functionality should be accessible through a programmatic API that could be called by various legal tools (though implementing a UI is not part of this project).

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Legal hold application and enforcement with proper authorization controls
- Chain of custody logging with tamper detection and complete access tracking
- Redaction version management with appropriate security controls
- Matter-based organization with correct relationship maintenance
- Jurisdictional retention policy enforcement with timely disposition
- Cryptographic verification of document integrity and authenticity

### Critical User Scenarios
- Applying legal holds across multiple related matters
- Producing chain of custody documentation for court proceedings
- Managing multiple redaction versions of sensitive documents
- Reorganizing documents when matters are transferred or consolidated
- Complying with conflicting retention requirements across jurisdictions
- Verifying document authenticity for evidentiary purposes

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial backup of a 100,000-document matter completing in under 4 hours
- Legal hold application propagating to all documents within 5 minutes
- Chain of custody queries returning complete access history within 10 seconds
- Redaction detection and processing at a rate of at least 15 pages per second
- Matter reorganization reflecting in the backup system within 5 minutes
- Retention policy evaluation completing within 30 minutes for a full system audit

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of conflicting legal holds and retention policies
- Recovery from attempted unauthorized modifications to held documents
- Proper functioning with very large legal documents (e.g., trial transcripts, discovery productions)
- Correct behavior when matters span multiple jurisdictions with different requirements
- Appropriate handling of encrypted or password-protected legal documents
- Graceful operation during litigation support database integration

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage for all functional components
- 100% coverage of all public APIs
- All error handling paths must be explicitly tested
- Performance tests must verify all stated benchmarks
- Integration tests must verify all external system interfaces

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented and pass their respective test cases.
2. The system demonstrates effective legal hold functionality with proper authorization controls.
3. Chain of custody documentation provides complete, tamper-evident access records.
4. Redaction-aware backup correctly manages different versions with appropriate security.
5. Case-based organization accurately reflects legal matter relationships.
6. Jurisdiction-specific retention policies correctly implement regulatory requirements.
7. All performance benchmarks are met under the specified load conditions.
8. Code quality meets professional standards with appropriate documentation.

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:

## Development Setup
1. Use `uv venv` to setup a virtual environment. From within the project directory, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
3. CRITICAL: Before submitting, run the tests with pytest-json-report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
4. Verify that all tests pass and the pytest_results.json file has been generated.

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a critical requirement for project completion.
