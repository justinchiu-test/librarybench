# Clinical Research Data Explorer

## Overview
An interactive, terminal-based data exploration framework tailored for clinical research coordinators who need to analyze patient outcomes across multiple treatment protocols. This specialized explorer enables secure analysis of sensitive medical data while maintaining patient confidentiality in environments where external software installation is restricted.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel coordinates medical research studies analyzing patient outcomes across multiple treatment protocols. She needs to explore complex clinical datasets to identify potential correlations and trends while maintaining strict patient confidentiality in secure environments where external software installation is restricted.

## Key Requirements
1. **Custom anonymization filters** - Automatically detect and mask potentially identifying information during visualization, essential for maintaining HIPAA compliance and patient privacy while still allowing meaningful data analysis. The system must identify common PII patterns and apply appropriate masking without manual intervention.

2. **Statistical significance highlighting** - Automatically flag correlations meeting configurable p-value thresholds, crucial for quickly identifying potentially meaningful relationships in complex multivariate clinical data. Researchers must be able to adjust significance thresholds to match study requirements.

3. **Medical terminology recognition** - Add contextual information to data points with clinical significance, enabling non-specialist team members to understand specialized terminology and standardized codes. This feature must link to standardized medical dictionaries and ontologies.

4. **Regulatory compliance export** - Generate documentation appropriate for IRB reviews and medical journals, streamlining the process of preparing findings for regulatory submission and publication. Exports must follow templates appropriate for common medical journals and IRB requirements.

5. **Longitudinal patient tracking visualizations** - Show treatment progression timelines across multiple dimensions, critical for understanding how patient outcomes evolve over time in response to interventions. The system must support multiple time series with clinical event markers.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All data processing functions must maintain data integrity and be verifiable with known test datasets
  - Statistical calculations must be validated against established statistical packages
  - Anonymization functions must be tested with synthetic PII data to ensure complete masking
  - Export formatting must be validated against actual IRB and journal templates

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Must handle datasets of up to 10,000 patients with 100+ variables each
  - Statistical calculations should complete within 5 seconds for typical analysis operations
  - Filtering and visualization updates must be near real-time (< 1 second) for interactive exploration
  - Memory usage must remain below 4GB even with full dataset loaded

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for importing from common clinical data formats (CSV, XLSX, REDCap exports, SPSS files)
  - Export to statistical formats (R, STATA) and documentation formats (PDF, DOCX)
  - Integration with medical terminology databases (SNOMED CT, ICD-10, RxNorm)
  - Support for anonymized dataset sharing via secure export formats

- **Key Constraints**:
  - No external network access during analysis for data security
  - No persistent storage of raw data, all temporary files must be securely deleted
  - All processing must occur on local machine without cloud dependencies
  - Must operate within terminal environment with no GUI components

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The Clinical Research Data Explorer must provide a comprehensive data analysis framework focused on medical research needs:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Import clinical datasets from various formats with automatic field type detection
   - Apply privacy filters to automatically detect and mask PII (names, identifiers, etc.)
   - Normalize medical codes and terminology across different standards
   - Implement data validation rules specific to clinical research

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Calculate key statistical measures (mean, median, variance) for continuous variables
   - Perform hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA) with automatic p-value reporting
   - Calculate confidence intervals and effect sizes for treatment comparisons
   - Implement survival analysis and time-to-event calculations

3. **Visualization Framework**:
   - Generate patient timeline visualizations showing treatment events and outcomes
   - Create distribution plots for outcome measures across treatment groups
   - Build correlation matrices highlighting statistically significant relationships
   - Produce longitudinal trend visualizations for key clinical metrics

4. **Privacy and Compliance**:
   - Implement robust anonymization algorithms for all patient identifiers
   - Track and log all data transformations for complete audit trail
   - Generate compliance documentation for IRB and regulatory submissions
   - Ensure all exports meet privacy standards for medical publications

5. **Medical Context Integration**:
   - Link data elements to standard medical terminology databases
   - Provide contextual information for specialized medical codes and measurements
   - Flag clinically meaningful patterns based on medical domain knowledge
   - Support annotation with relevant clinical guidelines and literature references

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Anonymization correctly masks all PII in diverse datasets
  - Statistical calculations match results from reference implementations
  - Timeline visualizations correctly represent patient progression
  - Exports conform to required formats for regulatory submission
  - Medical terminology integration provides accurate contextual information

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Importing and anonymizing a new clinical dataset
  - Performing statistical analysis across treatment groups
  - Visualizing patient progression over multiple timepoints
  - Identifying statistically significant correlations between variables
  - Generating compliant documentation for IRB submission

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Import and anonymization of 10,000-patient dataset within 30 seconds
  - Statistical analysis operations complete within 5 seconds
  - Visualization generation within 3 seconds for complex timeline views
  - Memory usage remains below 4GB during all operations
  - Export generation completes within 15 seconds for full reports

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling missing or incomplete clinical data
  - Processing inconsistent terminology across data sources
  - Managing statistical analysis with small sample sizes
  - Detecting and flagging potential data quality issues
  - Dealing with outliers and extreme values in clinical measurements

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 95% code coverage for all core functionality
  - 100% coverage for privacy and anonymization modules
  - All public APIs must have integration tests
  - Key statistical functions must have validation tests against known outputs

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass
