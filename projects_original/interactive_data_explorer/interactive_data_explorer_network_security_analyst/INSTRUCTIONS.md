# Network Security Data Explorer

## Overview
A specialized terminal-based data exploration framework designed for security analysts who need to analyze enterprise network traffic patterns, detect potential security threats, and identify anomalous behavior in large volumes of connection logs and packet metadata. This tool enables comprehensive security analysis without transferring sensitive data to external systems.

## Persona Description
Omar monitors enterprise network traffic patterns to detect potential security threats. He needs to quickly identify anomalous behavior in large volumes of connection logs and packet metadata without transferring sensitive data to external systems.

## Key Requirements
1. **Traffic pattern heatmaps** - Generate visual representations of connection volumes across IP space and time to reveal unusual communication patterns. Security analysts need to quickly identify unexpected communication flows, port scans, and other suspicious traffic patterns that may indicate compromise or reconnaissance activities.

2. **Protocol deviation highlighting** - Automatically identify and flag unusual application behaviors that deviate from standard protocol specifications. This is critical for detecting protocol-based attacks, tunneling, and covert channels that leverage legitimate protocols in unexpected ways.

3. **Entity resolution** - Link disparate network identifiers (IPs, hostnames, MAC addresses) to specific devices and users, providing context for security investigations. Analysts need to understand which physical and logical entities are involved in suspicious activities, even when identifiers change.

4. **Threat signature correlation** - Match observed activity patterns against known attack vectors and tactics from threat intelligence sources. This allows analysts to quickly determine if observed behaviors match known threat actor techniques and take appropriate defensive actions.

5. **Alert triage prioritization** - Rank security anomalies by potential impact and confidence levels to focus analyst attention on the most critical threats. With large volumes of potential security events, analysts need intelligent prioritization to focus their limited time on the most significant threats.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Pattern detection algorithms must be verified against known attack datasets
  - Protocol analysis must correctly identify deviations from standard specifications
  - Entity resolution must be tested with complex identifier relationships
  - Threat signature matching must be validated against public threat intelligence
  - Alert prioritization must be consistent with security best practices

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Must handle at least 10 million connection logs per analysis session
  - Pattern detection should complete within 30 seconds for 1 million log entries
  - Entity resolution must process 100,000 identifiers within 10 seconds
  - Memory usage must remain below 4GB even with large datasets
  - Interactive filtering operations must complete within 2 seconds

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for common log formats (Syslog, CEF, ELF, JSON, CSV)
  - Import capability for threat intelligence feeds (STIX/TAXII, MISP)
  - Export functionality for security incident reports
  - Compatibility with common network analysis tools output formats
  - Support for custom signature definitions and detection rules

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All analysis must be performed locally without external data transmission
  - Sensitive network data must never be written to disk unencrypted
  - All operations must be logged for security audit purposes
  - Must function in high-security environments with network restrictions
  - Should preserve original log integrity for forensic purposes

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The Network Security Data Explorer must provide a comprehensive framework for network security analysis:

1. **Traffic Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Process connection logs from multiple sources and formats
   - Aggregate traffic by various dimensions (IP, port, protocol, time)
   - Generate traffic heatmaps and flow visualizations
   - Identify unusual traffic patterns and communication relationships
   - Implement time-based analysis for temporal anomalies

2. **Protocol and Behavioral Analysis**:
   - Parse and decode common network protocol structures
   - Validate protocol usage against standard specifications
   - Detect anomalous protocol behaviors and misuse
   - Identify covert channels and protocol tunneling
   - Analyze encrypted traffic patterns without decryption

3. **Entity Correlation and Context**:
   - Track network identifiers across multiple log sources
   - Resolve identifiers to consistent entity representations
   - Maintain relationship graphs between network entities
   - Enrich entity data with organizational context
   - Track identifier changes and movements over time

4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
   - Import and normalize threat intelligence from multiple sources
   - Match observed patterns against known threat signatures
   - Calculate confidence scores for potential matches
   - Track threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
   - Provide context from threat intelligence for detected anomalies

5. **Alert Management and Triage**:
   - Generate prioritized security alerts based on multiple factors
   - Calculate risk scores based on asset value and threat severity
   - Group related alerts into security incidents
   - Implement alert deduplication and suppression
   - Track alert lifecycle and investigation status

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Traffic pattern visualizations correctly represent connection distributions
  - Protocol deviation detection identifies known protocol abuses
  - Entity resolution correctly links related network identifiers
  - Threat signature correlation matches known attack patterns
  - Alert prioritization appropriately ranks security events

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Analyzing network logs to identify potential data exfiltration
  - Detecting scanning and reconnaissance activities
  - Correlating disparate events into a cohesive attack timeline
  - Matching unusual network activity against threat intelligence
  - Prioritizing security alerts for efficient incident response

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Process and analyze 10 million log entries within 3 minutes
  - Generate traffic heatmaps for 1 million connections within 20 seconds
  - Resolve and correlate 100,000 network identifiers within 15 seconds
  - Match 10,000 events against 5,000 threat signatures within 30 seconds
  - Calculate and sort alert priorities for 1,000 events within 5 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling corrupted or malformed log entries
  - Processing logs with inconsistent timestamp formats or time zones
  - Managing conflicting entity resolution information
  - Dealing with partial matching of threat signatures
  - Preventing false positive cascades in alert generation

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 90% code coverage for all core functionality
  - 100% coverage for security-critical functions
  - All parsers tested with valid and malformed input
  - Complete integration tests for all public APIs
  - Performance tests for all time-critical operations

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation of the Network Security Data Explorer will demonstrate:

1. Effective visualization of network traffic patterns highlighting anomalies
2. Accurate detection of protocol deviations and application-level abnormalities
3. Reliable correlation of disparate network identifiers to consistent entities
4. Successful matching of observed activity to known threat patterns
5. Intelligent prioritization of security alerts based on risk and confidence

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

To set up the development environment, use:
```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
