# Sports Performance Data Explorer

## Overview
A specialized terminal-based data exploration framework designed for sports performance analysts who need to analyze athlete performance data, identify training optimization opportunities, detect injury risk factors, and discover tactical patterns that contribute to competitive advantage. This tool enables comprehensive athletic performance analysis without requiring graphical interfaces or specialized hardware.

## Persona Description
Javier analyzes athlete performance data for a professional sports team. He needs to identify training optimization opportunities, injury risk factors, and tactical patterns that contribute to competitive advantage.

## Key Requirements
1. **Biomechanical stress visualization** - Generate clear representations mapping physical loads across different movement patterns to identify potential injury risks and optimization opportunities. This is critical for understanding how specific activities and techniques impact athlete bodies and for developing targeted injury prevention strategies.

2. **Performance degradation detection** - Implement algorithms to identify fatigue signatures in athletic metrics that may indicate overtraining or injury risk. Early detection of declining performance patterns helps coaching staff manage athlete workloads and prevent serious injuries before they occur.

3. **Opposition pattern analysis** - Develop analytical tools to reveal exploitable tendencies in competitor behavior, providing strategic advantages for game planning. Understanding systematic patterns in opposing teams and athletes helps develop effective competitive strategies and tactical adjustments.

4. **Tactical formation visualization** - Create representations showing spatial relationships between team members during different game situations to optimize positioning and coordination. This feature helps coaches and analysts understand team structure dynamics and improve strategic positioning.

5. **Training response optimization** - Implement analysis techniques correlating workout regimens with performance outcomes to personalize training programs for individual athletes. This helps maximize each athlete's development by identifying which training approaches produce the best results for different individuals.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Biomechanical load calculations must be validated against sports science benchmarks
  - Fatigue detection algorithms must be tested with known degradation patterns
  - Pattern recognition must be verified for accuracy with annotated game data
  - Spatial analysis must produce consistent results for standard formation scenarios
  - Training correlation models must be validated against known outcome datasets

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Must handle datasets spanning multiple seasons (>500 games, >10,000 training sessions)
  - Analysis operations should complete within 5 seconds for most functions
  - Biomechanical stress calculations for a full game within 10 seconds
  - Memory usage must remain below 4GB even with large historical datasets
  - Support for real-time processing of incoming performance data during games

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for common sports analytics data formats (CSV, JSON, proprietary wearable exports)
  - Import capability for video tracking data and event logs
  - Export functionality for coaching reports and player briefings
  - Compatibility with wearable sensor data formats from major vendors
  - Integration with team management and medical record systems

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Strict data confidentiality to protect competitive advantage and athlete privacy
  - All visualizations must be terminal-compatible without external dependencies
  - Analysis must be reproducible with consistent results for decision justification
  - Must function in bandwidth-limited environments (locker rooms, travel situations)
  - Should support portable operation on standard team-issued laptops

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

  - Detecting early signs of fatigue in a player's performance metrics
  - Identifying exploitable patterns in an upcoming opponent's behavior
  - Optimizing team formations based on spatial analysis
  - Personalizing training programs based on individual response patterns

  - Analyze season-long performance trends within 10 seconds
  - Process 5 seasons of opponent data for pattern detection within 20 seconds
  - Generate formation analysis for a full game within 5 seconds
  - Memory usage below 4GB during all operations

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling incomplete tracking data from technology failures
  - Managing inconsistent data sampling rates from different sensors
  - Processing unusual game situations or outlier performances
  - Dealing with personnel changes and their impact on team patterns
  - Accounting for environmental factors in performance data

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - 90% code coverage for all core functionality
  - 100% coverage for injury risk-related functions
  - All algorithms validated against benchmark datasets
  - Complete integration tests for all public APIs
  - Performance tests for all computationally intensive operations

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
A successful implementation of the Sports Performance Data Explorer will demonstrate:

1. Accurate visualization of biomechanical stress across different movement patterns
