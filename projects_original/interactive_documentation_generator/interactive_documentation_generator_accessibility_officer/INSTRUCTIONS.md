# Accessible Documentation Compliance System

A specialized documentation platform that ensures technical documentation meets accessibility standards, provides alternative formats, and optimizes content for users with disabilities.

## Overview

The Accessible Documentation Compliance System enables accessibility officers to automatically identify and remediate accessibility issues in technical documentation. It provides tools for automated compliance checking, screen reader simulation, alternative format generation, color contrast analysis, and keyboard navigation optimization to ensure documentation is fully accessible to all users.

## Persona Description

Raj ensures that all company documentation meets accessibility standards for users with disabilities. He needs to identify and remediate accessibility issues while providing alternative content formats where necessary.

## Key Requirements

1. **Automated Accessibility Compliance Checking** - The system must automatically analyze documentation against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards, identifying specific violations and recommended fixes. This is critical for Raj because manual checking of extensive documentation is prohibitively time-consuming, and automated scanning ensures comprehensive coverage of all accessibility requirements.

2. **Screen Reader Simulation** - The tool must provide a simulation of how documentation will be experienced by screen reader users, including reading order, element recognition, and pronounced content. This feature is essential for Raj to identify issues with navigation structure, missing alternative text, and other problems that affect users with visual impairments without requiring manual testing with every screen reader technology.

3. **Alternative Format Generation** - The system must automatically convert documentation into accessible alternative formats, particularly audio versions using text-to-speech technology. As an accessibility officer, Raj needs to ensure documentation is available to users who cannot access written content, providing equivalent experiences regardless of disability.

4. **Color Contrast Analysis** - The tool must analyze all text and visual elements for sufficient color contrast ratios according to WCAG standards, flagging issues that could affect users with visual impairments. This helps Raj ensure documentation is readable by users with color blindness or low vision conditions, preventing exclusion of these user groups.

5. **Keyboard Navigation Optimization** - The system must evaluate and enhance keyboard navigability of interactive documentation elements, ensuring all functionality is accessible without a mouse. This is vital for Raj because many users with motor disabilities rely exclusively on keyboard or alternative input devices, and proper navigation structure ensures they can effectively use the documentation.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests with minimum 95% code coverage
- WCAG compliance checking must be testable with known-good and known-bad samples
- Screen reader simulation must be verifiable against actual screen reader output
- Alternative format generation must be testable for content equivalence
- Keyboard navigation must be testable through simulated keyboard traversal

### Performance Expectations
- Accessibility compliance checking must complete in under 2 minutes for 1000 pages
- Screen reader simulation must process pages in real-time (< 100ms per element)
- Alternative format generation must complete in under 5 minutes for a 300-page document
- Color contrast analysis must complete in under 10 seconds per page
- Navigation optimization must complete in under 30 seconds for a complete documentation set

### Integration Points
- Document object model (DOM) parsers for content analysis
- Text-to-speech engines for audio generation
- Color analysis libraries for contrast checking
- Headless browsers for interactive element testing
- WCAG validation libraries and APIs

### Key Constraints
- All functionality must be implementable without UI components
- Must support at least WCAG 2.1 AA compliance level
- Must handle documentation with complex technical diagrams and code samples
- Must process interactive documentation with JavaScript-based components
- Must support documentation with embedded video and audio content

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system must provide:

1. A WCAG compliance scanning engine that analyzes documentation for accessibility violations
2. A screen reader simulation system that models how assistive technology processes content
3. A text-to-speech conversion engine that generates audio versions of documentation
4. A color contrast analysis system that evaluates visual elements against WCAG standards
5. A keyboard navigation analysis system that verifies and optimizes tab order and focus handling
6. A remediation recommendation engine that suggests specific fixes for identified issues
7. A compliance reporting system that tracks accessibility status across documentation sets

These components should work together to create a comprehensive accessibility compliance system that both identifies issues and facilitates their resolution across all documentation.

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests for:

### Key Functionalities Verification
- WCAG compliance checking correctly identifies accessibility violations
- Screen reader simulation accurately models assistive technology behavior
- Alternative format generation creates equivalent content in different formats
- Color contrast analysis correctly identifies insufficient contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation optimization properly enhances tab order and focus handling

### Critical User Scenarios
- A new documentation set is scanned for accessibility compliance
- Documentation with complex tables and diagrams is made screen reader accessible
- Technical documentation is converted to audio format
- Documentation with color-coded elements is analyzed for contrast issues
- Interactive API documentation is optimized for keyboard-only users

### Performance Benchmarks
- Compliance checking performs efficiently on large documentation sets
- Screen reader simulation processes complex pages in real-time
- Alternative format generation completes within time limits
- Contrast analysis and navigation optimization scale appropriately with content size

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Processing documentation with embedded iframes or third-party content
- Handling mathematical notations and scientific formulas
- Managing complex SVG diagrams and technical illustrations
- Dealing with code samples and command-line instructions
- Processing documentation with custom interactive elements

### Required Test Coverage
- Minimum 95% test coverage for all components
- 100% coverage for WCAG compliance rule implementations
- Integration tests for all format conversion operations
- Performance tests for all scanning and analysis operations

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Automated accessibility checking identifies at least 95% of WCAG violations in test content
2. Screen reader simulation accurately models the experience of at least 3 major screen readers
3. Alternative format generation creates functionally equivalent audio versions of documentation
4. Color contrast analysis correctly identifies at least 98% of contrast ratio violations
5. Keyboard navigation optimization makes all interactive elements fully keyboard accessible

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. From within the project directory, create a virtual environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. Run tests with pytest-json-report to generate the required report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.
