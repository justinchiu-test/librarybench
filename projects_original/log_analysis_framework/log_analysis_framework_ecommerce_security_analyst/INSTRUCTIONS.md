# E-commerce Security Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for security analysts monitoring high-traffic e-commerce platforms that process sensitive payment data. This system provides real-time security breach detection, compliance monitoring, and fraud pattern analysis to protect customer data and financial transactions.

## Persona Description
Sophia monitors security logs for a high-traffic e-commerce platform processing sensitive payment data. She needs to identify potential security breaches and compliance issues across transaction processing systems in real-time.

## Key Requirements

1. **PCI DSS Compliance Reporting**
   - Automatic detection of regulated data appearing in logs (credit card numbers, CVV codes, etc.)
   - Compliance validation reporting for PCI DSS requirements related to logging and monitoring
   - Alerting on potential compliance violations with severity classification
   - This feature is critical because e-commerce platforms must maintain strict PCI DSS compliance to protect payment data, and accidental logging of sensitive information could lead to serious compliance breaches.

2. **Attack Pattern Recognition**
   - Classification of security events using MITRE ATT&CK framework taxonomy
   - Detection of common attack sequences like credential stuffing, SQL injection, and XSS attempts
   - Correlation of discrete events into cohesive attack campaigns
   - This feature is essential because it allows Sophia to quickly identify sophisticated attack patterns across distributed systems and prioritize response based on standardized threat classifications.

3. **User Session Correlation**
   - Linking activities across multiple services to individual customer sessions
   - Timeline reconstruction of user journeys through the e-commerce platform
   - Behavioral analysis to identify account takeover and session hijacking attempts
   - This feature is vital because tracing user activity across microservices is necessary to detect anomalous behavior that wouldn't be apparent when looking at individual service logs in isolation.

4. **Fraud Pattern Detection**
   - Anomaly scoring based on historical transaction patterns
   - Detection of unusual purchasing behavior or transaction characteristics
   - Recognition of known fraud signatures across user accounts
   - This feature is important because identifying fraudulent transactions quickly can prevent financial losses and protect both customers and the business from fraudulent activities.

5. **Geographic Access Visualization**
   - Highlighting unusual login locations and traffic sources based on IP geolocation
   - Detection of impossible travel scenarios (logins from distant locations in short timeframes)
   - Visualization of traffic patterns with suspicious origin or destination mapping
   - This feature is necessary because geographic anomalies often provide early indicators of compromised accounts or distributed attacks targeting the e-commerce platform.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All security detection rules must be independently testable with positive and negative test cases
- Detection accuracy must be quantifiably measurable (false positive/negative rates)
- Tests must include sample data that simulates real attack patterns without containing actual exploits
- Performance testing must verify real-time analysis capabilities under high log volume

### Performance Expectations
- Real-time analysis with alert generation in under 5 seconds from log creation
- Support for processing at least 20,000 log entries per second during peak shopping periods
- Pattern detection algorithms must complete in under 1 second per batch of 10,000 log entries
- Storage and indexing efficiency suitable for retaining 90 days of security logs

### Integration Points
- Log collection from web servers, application servers, and payment processing systems
- Integration with external threat intelligence feeds for up-to-date attack signatures
- Export of security events to SIEM systems and compliance reporting tools
- API endpoints for security automation and incident response systems

### Key Constraints
- Cannot store or process actual credit card numbers or other PCI-regulated data
- Must minimize false positives while maintaining high detection sensitivity
- Should operate without impacting the performance of the e-commerce platform
- Must provide secure access controls for sensitive security information

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The core functionality of the E-commerce Security Log Analysis Framework includes:

1. **Secure Log Ingestion and Processing**
   - Secure collection of logs from various e-commerce system components
   - Real-time redaction and handling of sensitive data according to PCI DSS requirements
   - Normalization and enrichment of security event data from diverse sources

2. **Security Analysis Engine**
   - MITRE ATT&CK-based security event classification
   - User session correlation across distributed services
   - Multi-factor behavioral analysis for fraud detection
   - Geographic anomaly detection with impossible travel identification
   - Pattern matching against known attack signatures and emerging threats

3. **Compliance Monitoring**
   - PCI DSS logging requirement validation
   - Sensitive data detection with redaction capabilities
   - Audit trail generation for compliance reporting
   - Control validation for security logging standards

4. **Alert Management and Response**
   - Prioritized alerting based on threat severity and business impact
   - Contextual information gathering for security events
   - Automated response recommendations based on threat classification
   - False positive reduction through machine learning feedback loops

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accurate detection of PCI DSS compliance violations in log data
- Correct classification of security events using MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Reliable correlation of user sessions across distributed services
- Precise identification of fraud patterns in transaction logs
- Accurate geographic anomaly detection for login events

### Critical User Scenarios
- Detecting and responding to an active SQL injection attack
- Identifying a coordinated credential stuffing campaign
- Recognizing fraudulent transaction patterns across multiple accounts
- Detecting accidental logging of sensitive cardholder data
- Identifying session hijacking attempts on high-value accounts

### Performance Benchmarks
- Security event processing latency: Maximum 5 seconds from log creation to alert
- Throughput: Minimum 20,000 security events per second during peak periods
- Analysis accuracy: False positive rate below 1%, false negative rate below 0.1% for critical attacks
- Storage efficiency: Retention of 90 days of security logs with reasonable storage constraints

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling encrypted or obfuscated attack patterns
- Managing partial or corrupted log entries
- Processing logs during DDoS attacks (extreme volume)
- Detecting sophisticated attack patterns that evolve to avoid detection
- Handling legitimate but unusual user behavior without generating false alarms

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% line coverage for all security-critical code
- 100% coverage of pattern detection and classification logic
- Comprehensive testing of all PCI DSS compliance detection rules
- Performance testing under various load conditions including peak traffic scenarios

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
