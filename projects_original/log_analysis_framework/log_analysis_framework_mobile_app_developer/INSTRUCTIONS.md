# Mobile Application Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for mobile app developers to understand crash patterns, performance issues, and user behavior across millions of app installations. This system provides insights that help prioritize bug fixes, identify platform-specific issues, and monitor the adoption of new features.

## Persona Description
Miguel is responsible for a consumer mobile application with millions of users. He needs to understand app crash patterns, performance issues, and user behavior to prioritize bug fixes and improvements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Crash Stack Deduplication**
   - Grouping similar errors to identify the most impactful issues based on stack trace similarity
   - Frequency analysis and impact assessment based on affected user count and app versions
   - Classification of crashes by root cause categories (memory issues, API errors, UI exceptions, etc.)
   - This feature is critical because it allows Miguel to focus on fixing the most impactful issues first, rather than being overwhelmed by thousands of similar crash reports.

2. **User Journey Reconstruction**
   - Showing exact steps and interactions leading up to app failures
   - Session timeline construction showing screen transitions, network calls, and user actions
   - State reconstruction at the time of failure including app configuration and device context
   - This feature is essential because understanding the specific sequence of events that leads to crashes enables developers to reproduce and fix issues more efficiently.

3. **Device and OS Version Correlation**
   - Identifying platform-specific problems across different device manufacturers and OS versions
   - Statistical analysis of crash and performance data segmented by device characteristics
   - Comparison tools to highlight issues specific to certain device types or OS updates
   - This feature is vital as mobile app developers must support a wide range of devices, and many issues only appear on specific hardware/software combinations.

4. **Performance Regression Detection**
   - Comparing metrics before and after releases to identify new performance issues
   - Trending analysis of key performance indicators (startup time, memory usage, UI responsiveness)
   - Automatic detection of statistically significant degradations following app updates
   - This feature is important because gradual performance degradation can significantly impact user experience and retention, and is often difficult to spot without systematic measurement.

5. **Feature Adoption Tracking**
   - Showing usage patterns of new app capabilities
   - Funnel analysis for multi-step features to identify abandonment points
   - Cohort analysis to understand adoption rates across different user segments
   - This feature is necessary because it helps developers understand whether new features are being discovered and used as intended, or if they require UI improvements or user education.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All analysis algorithms must be testable with synthetic crash and session data
- Crash grouping accuracy must be quantifiably measurable
- Performance metric calculations must be verifiable with known input/output pairs
- Tests must cover a representative range of device types and OS versions

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 1,000 crash reports per minute
- Handle logs from at least 10 million daily active users
- Complete complex analyses (e.g., regression detection) in under 60 seconds
- Storage optimization for long-term retention of crash data for trend analysis

### Integration Points
- Mobile app SDK integration for crash reporting and analytics
- API for programmatic access to analysis results by CI/CD systems
- Export capabilities for project management and bug tracking tools
- External device database for hardware and OS version details

### Key Constraints
- Minimize impact on mobile app performance and battery usage
- Respect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations
- Support offline caching of logs when network connectivity is unavailable
- Manage storage efficiently for clients with limited device space

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- Reliable detection of performance regressions between app versions
- Accurate tracking and analysis of feature adoption rates

### Critical User Scenarios
- Identifying and prioritizing the most impactful crashes affecting users
- Reconstructing the exact steps to reproduce a difficult bug
- Determining if a performance issue is specific to certain devices
- Detecting performance regressions introduced in a new release
- Analyzing why users aren't completing a new feature workflow

### Performance Benchmarks
- Crash processing time: Less than 500ms per crash report
- User journey reconstruction: Complete analysis of 10,000 sessions in under 30 seconds
- Device correlation analysis: Process data from 100,000 unique device profiles in under 60 seconds
- Performance regression detection: Compare metrics across two app versions in under 30 seconds
- Feature adoption analysis: Generate reports for 1 million user sessions in under 2 minutes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed or incomplete crash reports
- Processing logs from modified or jailbroken devices
- Managing data from unreleased or beta app versions
