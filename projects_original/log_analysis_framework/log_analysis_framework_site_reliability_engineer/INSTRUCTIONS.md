# SRE-Focused Log Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized log analysis framework designed for site reliability engineers to maintain service level objectives (SLOs) for critical SaaS platforms. This system correlates logs with system metrics, identifies reliability issues proactively, tracks error budgets, and enables automated remediation to ensure high availability and performance.

## Persona Description
Priya maintains service level objectives (SLOs) for a critical SaaS platform. She needs to correlate logs with system metrics to identify reliability issues before they impact customers and automate remediation responses.

## Key Requirements

1. **SLO Impact Analysis**
   - Automatic correlation of log events with service level objective violations
   - Root cause identification for SLO breaches based on log patterns
   - Proactive detection of emerging issues before they affect SLOs
   - This feature is critical because it connects complex log data directly to reliability metrics that matter to the business, enabling SREs to focus on the most impactful issues.

2. **Error Budget Tracking**
   - Real-time calculation and visualization of error budget consumption
   - Historical trending of reliability metrics with forecasting
   - Burn rate alerting for accelerated error budget depletion
   - This feature is essential because error budgets provide the primary framework for balancing reliability work against feature development, and tracking consumption is fundamental to SRE practice.

3. **Automated Remediation Rule Creation**
   - Analysis of historical incident responses to identify effective remediation patterns
   - Generation of automated recovery procedures based on successful resolution templates
   - Effectiveness measurement for automated remediation actions
   - This feature is vital because it enables the progressive automation of incident response, reducing toil and allowing faster recovery from common failure modes.

4. **Incident Response Timeline Reconstruction**
   - Detailed chronological analysis of system events during incidents
   - Correlation of actions taken with system state changes
   - End-to-end reconstruction of incident lifecycle for postmortem analysis
   - This feature is important because thorough postmortem analysis depends on accurate timeline reconstruction, which is difficult to compile manually from diverse log sources.

5. **On-Call Rotation Integration**
   - Intelligent routing of alerts to the appropriate team member with contextual information
   - Knowledge base integration for faster incident resolution
   - On-call load balancing and fatigue prevention
   - This feature is necessary because effective on-call rotations depend on getting the right alerts to the right people with the right context, minimizing unnecessary pages while ensuring critical issues receive attention.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All SLO calculations must be testable with synthetic log and metric data
- Error budget algorithms must demonstrate mathematical correctness
- Remediation rule effectiveness must be measurable in controlled environments
- Incident timeline reconstruction must be verifiable against known sequences of events

### Performance Expectations
- Process and analyze at least 50,000 log entries per second
- Calculate SLO metrics in near real-time (< 10 second latency)
- Support historical analysis of at least 30 days of log data for trend analysis
- Generate incident timelines within seconds of a query, even for complex incidents

### Integration Points
- Metrics system integration (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)
- Alerting system integration (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)
- Incident management platform integration
- Automated remediation systems (Kubernetes operators, AWS Lambda, etc.)

### Key Constraints
- Must operate with minimal performance impact on production systems
- Should function during system degradation (be part of the solution, not the problem)
- Must handle temporary connectivity issues with dependent systems
- Should provide value without excessive configuration or maintenance

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- Automating remediation for a recurring infrastructure issue
- Conducting a thorough postmortem after a major outage
- Optimizing an on-call rotation for better incident response

### Performance Benchmarks
- Log processing throughput: Minimum 50,000 entries per second
- SLO calculation latency: Under 10 seconds for real-time monitoring
- Incident timeline generation: Under 30 seconds for a 24-hour incident period

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% line coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage of SLO calculation and error budget logic
- Comprehensive testing of remediation rule generation algorithms
- Full testing of incident timeline reconstruction with various event patterns

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
