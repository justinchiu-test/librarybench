# Museum Collection Metadata Management System

## Overview
A specialized metadata organization system for museum digital collections managers who need to implement institutional metadata standards while making diverse artifact collections accessible to researchers and the public.

## Persona Description
Elena is responsible for digitizing and cataloging artifacts across multiple museum departments. She needs to implement institutional metadata standards while making the collections accessible to researchers and the public.

## Key Requirements
1. **Institutional authority control**: Implement standardized terminology enforcement across different museum departments and collections. This is essential for maintaining consistency in naming, classification, and description of artifacts despite varying departmental practices and specialized vocabularies.

2. **Exhibition history tracking**: Develop a system to document when and where physical items have been displayed, including exhibition metadata and contextual information. This provides crucial provenance information and helps manage artifact exposure and conservation requirements.

3. **Multi-object relationship mapping**: Create functionality to connect related artifacts across various collections and departments. This enables thematic exploration of the museum's holdings and reveals connections between items that might otherwise remain isolated in departmental silos.

4. **Conservation documentation**: Build mechanisms to link condition reports with visual documentation of artifacts. This is critical for monitoring artifact preservation status and planning conservation interventions.

5. **Public access filtering**: Implement functionality to determine which metadata fields are visible to different user groups based on institutional policies. This balances making collections accessible while protecting sensitive information about artifacts, donors, or acquisition details.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All terminology control and standardization functions must be independently testable
- Use test fixtures with sample museum collection data from multiple departments
- Support simulation of exhibition history and conservation documentation
- Enable isolated testing of access control and filtering mechanisms

### Performance Expectations
- Process metadata for at least 10,000 artifacts efficiently
- Support museum collections with up to 1 million items
- Search operations should complete in under 3 seconds
- Handle complex relationship queries across departmental boundaries

### Integration Points
- Multiple media formats for artifact documentation (images, 3D scans, videos)
- Institutional controlled vocabularies and thesauri
- Conservation and condition documentation standards
- Exhibition management systems
- Access control and privacy frameworks

### Key Constraints
- No UI components - all functionality exposed through Python APIs
- System must respect departmental autonomy while enforcing institutional standards
- Data structures must accommodate diverse artifact types across disciplines
- All operations should be non-destructive to original documentation

## Core Functionality

The system must provide a Python library that enables:

1. **Institutional Metadata Standardization**
   - Enforce controlled vocabulary usage across departments
   - Normalize inconsistent terminology and classification
   - Maintain departmental specialization while ensuring institutional cohesion

2. **Exhibition and Display Management**
   - Track physical exhibition history of artifacts
   - Document display contexts and interpretive frameworks
   - Monitor cumulative exposure for conservation purposes

3. **Collection Relationships and Connections**
   - Map connections between related artifacts
   - Identify thematic groupings across departments
   - Support curatorial narrative development

4. **Conservation Status Management**
   - Link condition documentation to artifact records
   - Track conservation treatments and interventions
   - Associate visual documentation with condition reports

5. **Access Control and Public Interface**
   - Manage varied access levels for different user types
   - Filter sensitive metadata for public presentations
   - Support scholarly access while protecting institutional interests

## Testing Requirements

The implementation must include tests that verify:

1. **Authority Control**
   - Test enforcement of controlled vocabularies
   - Verify handling of departmental variations
   - Test normalization of legacy terminology

2. **Exhibition Tracking**
   - Test recording of complete exhibition histories
   - Verify association of contextual exhibition information
   - Test calculation of cumulative exposure metrics

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Test creation and maintenance of artifact relationships
   - Verify cross-departmental relationship discovery
   - Test thematic grouping and narrative construction

4. **Conservation Documentation**
   - Test linking of condition reports to artifacts
   - Verify association of visual documentation
   - Test tracking of conservation history

5. **Access Control**
   - Test filtering of metadata for different user groups
   - Verify protection of sensitive information
   - Test generation of appropriately redacted public records

**IMPORTANT:**
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Setup Instructions
1. Set up a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project: `uv pip install -e .`

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All five key requirements are fully implemented
2. Institutional authority control successfully standardizes terminology across departments
3. Exhibition history tracking comprehensively documents display contexts
4. Multi-object relationship mapping effectively connects related artifacts
5. Conservation documentation properly links condition reports and visual documentation
6. Public access filtering appropriately controls metadata visibility
7. All operations maintain institutional data integrity
8. All tests pass when run with pytest
9. A valid pytest_results.json file is generated showing all tests passing

**REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion.**
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```
