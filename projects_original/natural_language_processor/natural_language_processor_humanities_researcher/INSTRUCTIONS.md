# Literary Text Analysis Toolkit

A specialized natural language processing framework for analyzing historical texts, tracking authorship patterns, and identifying cultural and linguistic trends across literary works.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for digital humanities researchers to analyze historical and literary texts without requiring advanced programming knowledge. The toolkit focuses on historical language processing, intertextuality detection, stylometric analysis, thematic tracking, and comparative literary analysis, all implemented in pure Python.

## Persona Description

Dr. Park analyzes historical texts to identify authorship patterns, cultural trends, and linguistic evolution across centuries of literature. He needs accessible NLP tools that can be customized for specific literary analysis without requiring advanced programming or machine learning expertise.

## Key Requirements

1. **Historical Language Model**: Create adaptable language processing modules that handle archaic word forms, spelling variations, and evolving language patterns across different historical periods.
   - This is critical for Dr. Park as historical texts often contain language variations, obsolete terms, and inconsistent spelling that confuse standard NLP tools.
   - The system must recognize and normalize historical variants while preserving the meaningful distinctions between different periods and styles.

2. **Intertextuality Detection Engine**: Develop an algorithm to identify quotations, allusions, and textual borrowing between literary works, even when texts have been modified or translated.
   - This feature enables Dr. Park to trace how ideas spread throughout literary history and how authors influence one another.
   - The system must detect both exact quotations and paraphrased or thematically similar passages that indicate literary influence.

3. **Stylometric Analysis Framework**: Implement advanced stylometric tools that identify authorship signatures through linguistic patterns, vocabulary distribution, and syntactic structures.
   - This capability allows Dr. Park to attribute anonymous texts, detect collaborative authorship, and identify stylistic shifts within an author's career.
   - The analysis must be robust enough to distinguish between genuine stylistic differences and variations due to genre, subject matter, or historical period.

4. **Thematic Evolution Tracker**: Create a system to identify and track abstract concepts, motifs, and themes throughout literary periods, showing how they evolve over time.
   - This feature is essential for Dr. Park to analyze how cultural concepts developed and transformed throughout literary history.
   - The system must recognize thematic content even when expressed through different vocabulary, metaphors, or narrative structures.

5. **Literary Canon Comparison Tool**: Develop analytical methods to identify distinctive features of works within literary movements and compare characteristics across different canonical groupings.
   - This capability helps Dr. Park understand what makes certain works representative of their literary periods and how movements differ from one another.
   - The system must quantify distinctive linguistic and thematic features that define literary schools, movements, and periods.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All text processing algorithms must be deterministic for reproducible research
- Analysis results must be serializable for verification and sharing
- Algorithms must support configurable parameters to test different hypotheses
- Each analytical component must be independently testable
- Results must be comparable against established literary analysis benchmarks

### Performance Expectations
- Process full-length novels (>100,000 words) in under 5 minutes
- Handle corpus comparison across hundreds of texts in under 30 minutes
- Support incremental analysis for large corpora without full reprocessing
- Maintain consistent performance across texts from different historical periods
- Operate efficiently on texts with varying linguistic characteristics

### Integration Points
- Accept plain text, TEI XML, and other standard humanities text formats
- Support integration of existing literary metadata (publication date, author, genre)
- Export results in formats compatible with digital humanities tools
- Allow import of custom dictionaries and language models
- Provide hooks for incorporating external linguistic resources

### Key Constraints
- All implementations must use only Python standard library
- No reliance on pre-trained models requiring machine learning expertise
- Algorithms must be explainable and transparent in their operation
- Results must be reproducible with clear provenance
- Processing must be adaptable to different languages and historical periods
- Memory usage must be managed to handle very large corpus analysis

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Historical Language Processor**: A framework for analyzing texts with archaic language forms and spelling variations. It should:
   - Normalize historical spelling variations while preserving meaningful distinctions
   - Recognize and process archaic vocabulary and grammatical structures
   - Adapt to different historical periods and evolving language patterns
   - Map historical terms to their modern equivalents when appropriate
   - Support customizable rules for specific time periods or literary traditions

2. **Intertextual Reference Detector**: A system for identifying textual relationships between works. It should:
   - Detect direct quotations across a corpus of texts
   - Identify paraphrased or thematically similar passages
   - Map networks of influence between texts and authors
   - Quantify the strength of intertextual relationships
   - Support different levels of analysis from phrase-level to thematic parallels

3. **Stylometric Analysis Engine**: A toolkit for authorship analysis and style characterization. It should:
   - Extract and analyze distinctive linguistic features for authorship attribution
   - Compare stylistic signatures across different authors and works
   - Identify stylistic evolution within an author's body of work
   - Detect collaborative authorship and editorial intervention
   - Provide statistical validation of stylistic observations

4. **Thematic Development Analyzer**: A framework for tracking conceptual evolution across texts. It should:
   - Identify abstract themes and concepts not limited to specific vocabulary
   - Track thematic development across chronologically ordered texts
   - Map relationships between related concepts and themes
   - Quantify thematic shifts between different time periods
   - Identify innovative vs. traditional treatments of common themes

5. **Canon Analysis System**: Tools for comparative analysis of literary movements. It should:
   - Identify distinguishing features of literary movements and schools
   - Compare works against canonical examples to measure representativeness
   - Analyze how literary innovations spread within movements
   - Quantify differences between competing literary traditions
   - Support redefinition of canonical groupings for exploratory analysis

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using uv:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. Install testing tools:
   ```
   pip install pytest pytest-json-report
   ```

5. Run tests with JSON reporting:
   ```
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

IMPORTANT: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion. This file serves as proof that all tests pass and the implementation meets the specified requirements.
