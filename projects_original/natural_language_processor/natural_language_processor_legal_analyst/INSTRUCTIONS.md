# Legal Document Analysis Framework

A specialized natural language processing toolkit for analyzing legal texts, identifying obligations, detecting inconsistencies, and tracking regulatory compliance in contracts and legal documents.

## Overview

This project provides legal professionals with powerful tools to analyze contracts, legal briefs, and regulatory documents. The framework helps identify legal entities, detect obligations and commitments, link defined terms, find inconsistencies, and match text with relevant regulations. All functionality is implemented as Python libraries with no dependencies on external NLP tools, making it ideal for confidential legal document processing.

## Persona Description

Aisha reviews contracts, legal briefs, and regulatory documents to identify inconsistencies, obligations, and potential compliance issues. She needs specialized text analysis focusing on legal terminology, commitments, and conditional statements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Legal Entity Extraction System**: Develop algorithms to identify and categorize parties, jurisdictions, regulated items, and legal entities throughout documents.
   - This feature is critical for Aisha as it allows her to quickly establish who the relevant parties are, what jurisdictions apply, and which items are subject to regulation across lengthy legal documents.
   - The system must accurately detect and classify different types of legal entities even when referenced through different naming conventions or defined terms.

2. **Obligation and Requirement Detection**: Create a framework that identifies commitments, requirements, deadlines, and conditional obligations embedded within legal language.
   - This capability is essential for Aisha to ensure no contractual obligations are overlooked and to track compliance requirements across complex agreements.
   - The detection must distinguish between different types of obligations (must, shall, will) and identify their associated conditions, timeframes, and responsible parties.

3. **Definitional Reference Linking**: Implement a system to connect defined terms with their formal definitions within documents and track their usage throughout.
   - This feature helps Aisha ensure consistent interpretation of defined terms and verify that terms are used in accordance with their specific definitions.
   - The linking must handle common legal drafting patterns where terms are "incorporated by reference" from other sections or external documents.

4. **Inconsistency and Ambiguity Identification**: Build analytical tools to find contradictory statements, ambiguous clauses, and logical conflicts within legal documents.
   - This capability enables Aisha to identify potential areas of dispute or misinterpretation before they become problematic in practice.
   - The identification must detect both direct contradictions and subtle inconsistencies in obligation, permission, or definition of terms.

5. **Regulatory Citation Matching**: Develop a framework for connecting document text with specific laws, regulations, and legal standards that apply to particular provisions.
   - This feature allows Aisha to verify compliance with relevant regulations and ensure proper citation of controlling legal authorities.
   - The matching must recognize various citation formats and connect provisions to the appropriate external regulatory framework.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All entity extraction must be verifiable against expert-annotated legal documents
- Obligation detection should achieve measurable precision and recall against test corpora
- Reference linking must be testable for both accuracy and completeness
- Inconsistency detection should be validated against known conflicting provisions
- Citation matching must be verifiable against standard legal citation formats

### Performance Expectations
- Process and analyze documents up to 100 pages (50,000 words) in under 60 seconds
- Handle legal documents with complex nested structures and cross-references
- Support batch processing of multiple related documents (e.g., contract with amendments)
- Provide incremental analysis capability for efficient review of document revisions
- Maintain consistent performance regardless of document formatting or structure

### Integration Points
- Accept common legal document formats (DOC, DOCX, PDF, plain text)
- Export analysis results in structured formats suitable for legal review systems
- Support integration with specialized legal citation databases
- Enable incorporation of jurisdiction-specific rules and regulations
- Provide programmatic access to analysis results for integration with other legal tools

### Key Constraints
- Implementation must use only Python standard library
- Analysis must preserve document confidentiality with no external API dependencies
- System must handle variations in legal drafting styles across different jurisdictions
- Processing must be resilient to document formatting inconsistencies
- All analysis must be explainable and traceable to specific textual evidence
- Memory usage must be optimized to handle very large legal documents

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Legal Entity Recognizer**: A specialized named entity recognition system for legal documents. It should:
   - Identify parties, persons, organizations, and legal entities
   - Recognize jurisdictions, venues, and governing law provisions
   - Detect regulated items, controlled substances, and restricted technologies
   - Track entity relationships and hierarchies
   - Handle variations in entity references throughout documents

2. **Obligation Analysis Engine**: A framework for detecting and categorizing legal duties. It should:
   - Identify mandatory actions (shall, must, will, agrees to)
   - Detect conditional obligations and their triggering conditions
   - Recognize temporal aspects (deadlines, recurring obligations)
   - Extract responsible parties for each obligation
   - Classify obligation types (performance, payment, notification, etc.)

3. **Definition and Reference Manager**: A system for handling defined terms. It should:
   - Extract formal definitions and their scope of application
   - Link each term usage to its controlling definition
   - Track reference incorporation from external documents
   - Verify consistent usage according to definitions
   - Identify undefined terms that should have definitions

4. **Logical Consistency Analyzer**: A tool for detecting document inconsistencies. It should:
   - Identify direct contradictions between provisions
   - Detect logical conflicts in rights and obligations
   - Recognize ambiguous language and unclear references
   - Find gaps in procedural or conditional structures
   - Highlight potential interpretation conflicts

5. **Regulatory Compliance Matcher**: A framework for connecting text to applicable regulations. It should:
   - Recognize legal and regulatory citations in various formats
   - Link provisions to relevant external authorities
   - Verify compliance with referenced regulations
   - Track citation completeness and accuracy
   - Identify potentially missing regulatory references

## Testing Requirements

  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using uv:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. Install testing tools:
   ```
   pip install pytest pytest-json-report
   ```

5. Run tests with JSON reporting:
   ```
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

IMPORTANT: Generating and providing the pytest_results.json file is a CRITICAL requirement for project completion. This file serves as proof that all tests pass and the implementation meets the specified requirements.
