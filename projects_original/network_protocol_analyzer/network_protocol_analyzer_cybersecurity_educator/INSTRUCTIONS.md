# Educational Network Protocol Analysis Framework

## Overview
A network protocol analysis library specifically designed for cybersecurity education, providing clear visualization of protocol structures, controlled demonstration of common attack vectors, adjustable complexity levels for different student experience levels, collaborative analysis capabilities, and structured learning scenarios to teach network security concepts.

## Persona Description
Professor Wong teaches network security courses and needs to provide students with hands-on experience analyzing network protocols and security vulnerabilities. He requires a tool that clearly illustrates protocol structures and common attack vectors for educational purposes.

## Key Requirements

1. **Protocol Breakdown Visualization System**  
   Create a module that decomposes network packets to show each field and its purpose in protocol headers with educational annotations. This is critical for Professor Wong because it helps students understand protocol implementations at a granular level, making abstract networking concepts concrete and facilitating deeper comprehension of how vulnerabilities arise from protocol design.

2. **Attack Simulation Sandbox**  
   Implement functionality to safely demonstrate common network exploits in a controlled environment without requiring actual vulnerable systems. This feature is essential for Professor Wong to illustrate attack techniques like man-in-the-middle, packet injection, and protocol abuse patterns in a hands-on way while ensuring students cannot accidentally use these techniques outside the learning environment.

3. **Progressive Complexity Modes**  
   Develop capabilities to reveal different levels of protocol detail based on student experience level, from basic to advanced analysis. This is crucial for Professor Wong because it allows him to tailor the learning experience to different class levels, gradually introducing more complex concepts as students progress, and preventing beginners from becoming overwhelmed by technical details.

4. **Collaborative Analysis Framework**  
   Build a system allowing students to share and discuss findings within the tool, including annotations and observations about protocol behaviors. This allows Professor Wong to facilitate group learning activities where students can collaborate on analyzing traffic captures, sharing insights, and learning from each other's observations, which reinforces learning through peer education.

5. **Challenge Scenario System**  
   Create functionality to present guided discovery exercises focused on specific protocol vulnerabilities with progressive hints. This feature is vital for Professor Wong to create engaging, gamified learning experiences where students apply theoretical knowledge to discover real vulnerabilities, with structured guidance available when needed to prevent frustration while maintaining educational value.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with educational network captures
- Protocol visualization must be verifiable against reference protocol specifications
- Attack simulations must be reproducible with deterministic outcomes
- Collaborative features must be testable in isolated environments
- Challenge scenarios must be verifiable for correct solution detection

### Performance Expectations
- Support simultaneous analysis by classes of 50+ students
- Process standard educational capture files (up to 500MB) in under 30 seconds
- Render protocol breakdowns with under 1-second latency
- Support at least 10 concurrent attack simulations without performance degradation
- Load and validate challenge scenarios in under 5 seconds

### Integration Points
- Import from standard PCAP/PCAPNG files and educational capture libraries
- Export annotations and findings in formats suitable for assignment submission

### Key Constraints
- Must function securely in academic network environments
- Should never generate actual attack traffic outside the sandbox
- Must be accessible to students with varying technical backgrounds

- Must include proper ethical use guidelines and controls

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- Generate protocol visualizations within 500ms of request
- Support at least 30 concurrent users without performance degradation
- Execute attack simulations with less than 2-second initialization time
- Load and validate challenge scenarios in under 3 seconds

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions

- Minimum 90% code coverage for core functionality
- 95% coverage for protocol visualization components
- 95% coverage for attack simulation sandbox
- 90% coverage for complexity adjustment features
- 95% coverage for challenge scenario system

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The Educational Network Protocol Analysis Framework implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It accurately visualizes at least 10 common network protocols with proper field descriptions
2. It successfully demonstrates at least 5 different network attack scenarios in a safe sandbox
3. It provides at least 3 distinct complexity levels that effectively filter information for different student levels
4. It enables effective collaborative analysis with annotation and insight sharing capabilities
5. It includes at least 10 functional challenge scenarios with appropriate hint systems

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Project Setup and Environment

To set up the project environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project in development mode with `uv pip install -e .`
4. Install development dependencies including pytest-json-report

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY for project completion:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file serves as verification that all functionality works as required and all tests pass successfully. This file must be generated and included with your submission.
