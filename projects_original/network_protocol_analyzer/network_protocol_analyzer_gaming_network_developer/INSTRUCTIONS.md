# Game Network Protocol Optimization Framework

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analysis library designed for game developers to optimize multiplayer online game communications by analyzing latency patterns, packet loss impact, bandwidth optimization opportunities, detecting cheating patterns, and comparing performance across different regions to create smooth and fair multiplayer experiences.

## Persona Description
Jamal optimizes network code for multiplayer online games requiring low-latency communication. He needs to analyze custom game protocols and improve player experience by reducing lag and synchronization issues.

## Key Requirements

1. **Latency Spike Correlation System**  
   Create a module that identifies network conditions affecting gameplay by correlating latency spikes with specific network events or patterns. This is critical for Jamal because unexpected latency spikes can ruin player experience in fast-paced games, and understanding their root causes allows him to implement targeted mitigation strategies like adaptive packet sizing or predictive movement algorithms.

2. **Packet Loss Analysis**  
   Implement functionality to analyze the impact of packet loss on game state synchronization and player experience. This feature is essential for Jamal to understand how different types of game data are affected by network packet loss, helping him prioritize which data needs redundancy mechanisms and design appropriate recovery strategies for different gameplay elements.

3. **Bandwidth Optimization Analysis**  
   Develop capabilities to identify more efficient approaches for game state updates and network utilization. This is crucial for Jamal because optimizing bandwidth usage improves game performance for players with limited internet connections, reduces hosting costs for game servers, and allows more players to participate simultaneously without degrading the experience.

4. **Cheating Pattern Detection**  
   Build a system to identify potential manipulation of network communications that could indicate cheating attempts. This allows Jamal to develop more secure network protocols that resist common cheating techniques like packet manipulation, artificial latency, or state prediction exploitation, ensuring fair gameplay for all players and protecting the game's competitive integrity.

5. **Region-based Performance Comparison**  
   Create functionality to analyze and compare network performance across different geographic server deployments. This feature is vital for Jamal to optimize server placement, implement region-specific protocol adjustments, and ensure consistent player experience regardless of location, which is crucial for maintaining a global player base with equitable gameplay conditions.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with realistic game network traffic datasets
- Latency analysis must be verifiable with known delay patterns

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 1GB of game network traffic in under 5 minutes
- Analyze real-time game sessions with 100+ simultaneous players
- Detect latency spikes with millisecond precision

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The Game Network Protocol Optimization Framework implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It can accurately identify and correlate latency spikes with network conditions or events
2. It successfully quantifies the impact of packet loss on different types of game state data
3. It provides bandwidth optimization recommendations that reduce data usage by at least 15% in test scenarios
4. It detects at least 90% of common network manipulation cheating attempts in test datasets
5. It accurately compares and reports performance differences across simulated geographic regions

2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project in development mode with `uv pip install -e .`
4. Install development dependencies including pytest-json-report

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY for project completion:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file serves as verification that all functionality works as required and all tests pass successfully. This file must be generated and included with your submission.
