# Regulatory Compliance Network Analysis Framework

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analysis library designed for legal compliance officers to detect sensitive information in network traffic, verify compliance boundaries, confirm appropriate encryption usage, map geographical data flows, and generate documentation for regulatory audits to ensure organizational compliance with data protection regulations.

## Persona Description
Dr. Chen ensures corporate networks comply with data protection regulations and privacy laws. She needs to verify that sensitive information is properly secured and not transmitted in violation of compliance requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Sensitive Data Detection System**  
   Create a module that identifies personally identifiable information (PII) and other regulated data types within network traffic. This is critical for Dr. Chen because undetected sensitive data transmissions can lead to regulatory violations, data breaches, substantial fines, and reputation damage. The system must reliably detect various types of sensitive data even when fragmented across multiple packets.

2. **Compliance Boundary Verification**  
   Implement functionality to ensure regulated data stays within approved systems and network boundaries. This feature is essential for Dr. Chen to verify that sensitive information doesn't flow to unauthorized systems, cloud services, or third parties without proper controls, which is a fundamental requirement of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

3. **Encryption Verification System**  
   Develop capabilities to confirm that appropriate encryption protocols and methods are used for sensitive communications. This is crucial for Dr. Chen because many regulations explicitly require encryption for protected data, and she must verify that all sensitive data is encrypted with approved methods and sufficient key strengths before transmission.

4. **Data Transfer Geographical Mapping**  
   Build a system to track and visualize cross-border information flows and data transfer paths. This allows Dr. Chen to identify international data transfers that may trigger additional regulatory requirements under frameworks like GDPR, which places restrictions on data transfers to countries without adequate privacy protections.

5. **Regulatory Reporting Assistance**  
   Create functionality to automatically generate documentation for compliance audits based on network analysis findings. This feature is vital for Dr. Chen to efficiently prepare evidence for internal audits, regulatory inspections, and compliance certifications, reducing manual effort while ensuring consistent, thorough documentation of compliance controls.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with synthetic datasets containing mock sensitive data
- Sensitive data detection must be verifiable against known PII patterns
- Boundary verification must be testable against predefined network zones
- Encryption analysis must be validated against compliance requirements
- Geographical mapping must be verifiable with known IP geolocation data

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 1GB of network traffic data in under 15 minutes
- Scan for at least 50 different types of sensitive data patterns simultaneously
- Analyze TLS/SSL sessions for compliance within 5 seconds per session
- Generate compliance reports for 24 hours of traffic in under 10 minutes
- Support incremental analysis for continuous compliance monitoring

### Integration Points
- Import traffic from standard PCAP/PCAPNG files and proxy logs
- Export findings in formats compatible with GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) systems
- Integration with data classification systems and policies
- Support for importing compliance requirements from standard frameworks
- API for integration with SIEM and security monitoring tools

### Key Constraints
- Must handle HTTPS/TLS traffic with appropriate access to TLS session keys
- Must protect discovered sensitive data from unauthorized access
- Should function in highly regulated environments with strict security controls
- Must provide detailed evidence of analysis methodology for audit defensibility
- Should support multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Regulatory Compliance Network Analysis Framework should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Data Protection Analysis Engine**
   - Scan network traffic for regulated data types (PII, PHI, PCI, etc.)
   - Support for complex pattern matching including contextual validation
   - Content analysis across fragmented packets and sessions
   - Classification of discovered sensitive data by regulatory category

2. **Boundary Control Verification**
   - Monitor data flows across defined network boundaries
   - Track sensitive data movement between systems and zones
   - Verify compliance with data segregation requirements
   - Identify unauthorized data transfers between environments

3. **Cryptographic Compliance Analysis**
   - Verify encryption protocol usage for sensitive data
   - Validate cipher strengths against regulatory requirements
   - Detect unencrypted transmission of regulated information
   - Evaluate certificate validity and management practices

4. **Geographical Compliance Mapping**
   - Track international data transfers
   - Map data flows against jurisdictional boundaries
   - Identify transfers to regions with inadequate privacy protections
   - Document legal basis for cross-border data movements

5. **Compliance Documentation System**
   - Generate evidence of compliance controls
   - Document exceptions and potential violations
   - Create audit-ready reports with time-stamped findings
   - Maintain compliance verification artifacts

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of sensitive data detection
- Correctness of compliance boundary verification
- Effectiveness of encryption validation
- Precision of geographical data flow mapping
- Completeness of regulatory reporting

### Critical User Scenarios
- Identifying credit card numbers transmitted without proper encryption
- Verifying patient health information remains within authorized healthcare systems
- Confirming that personal data is encrypted with approved methods
- Tracking customer data transfers between EU and non-EU countries
- Generating documentation for an upcoming GDPR compliance audit

### Performance Benchmarks
- Detect sensitive data with at least 95% accuracy and less than 5% false positives
- Complete boundary compliance analysis for 24 hours of traffic in under 30 minutes
- Verify encryption compliance for 1,000 TLS sessions in under 5 minutes
- Generate geographical data flow maps from 1 week of traffic in under 20 minutes
- Produce comprehensive audit reports within 10 minutes of analysis completion

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling partially encrypted or mixed-mode communications
- Processing sensitive data split across multiple packets or sessions
- Analyzing encrypted tunnels and VPN traffic
- Dealing with custom or proprietary protocols carrying sensitive data
- Managing conflicting requirements from multiple regulatory frameworks

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core functionality
- 95% coverage for sensitive data detection
- 95% coverage for compliance boundary verification
- 90% coverage for encryption verification
- 95% coverage for regulatory reporting generation

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The Regulatory Compliance Network Analysis Framework implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It accurately detects at least 95% of sensitive data types required by major regulations in test datasets
2. It successfully verifies data transmission boundaries with correct identification of violations
3. It correctly validates encryption usage against regulatory requirements with minimal false negatives
4. It accurately maps geographical data flows including cross-border transfers requiring special handling
5. It generates comprehensive compliance documentation sufficient for regulatory audit requirements

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
