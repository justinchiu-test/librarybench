# Incident Response Network Analyzer

## Overview
A specialized network protocol analysis library designed specifically for cybersecurity incident response teams to rapidly analyze suspicious network traffic, identify attack patterns, reconstruct attack timelines, and generate actionable threat intelligence from captured network data.

## Persona Description
Elena works on a cybersecurity incident response team handling active network intrusions. She needs to quickly analyze suspicious network traffic patterns to identify attack vectors, contain breaches, and gather forensic evidence for investigations.

## Key Requirements

1. **Attack Pattern Recognition System**  
   Create a module that can match traffic against known exploit signatures and tactics. This is critical for Elena as it allows her to quickly identify malicious traffic patterns during active incidents without manually analyzing each packet, significantly reducing response time.

2. **Forensic Timeline Reconstruction**  
   Implement functionality to chronologically reconstruct network activities, highlighting suspicious events. This feature is essential for Elena to understand the progression of an attack, establish a sequence of events, and determine the initial entry point and subsequent lateral movement.

3. **Malware Command-and-Control Detection**  
   Develop capabilities to identify beaconing patterns, unusual connection intervals, and data exfiltration attempts. This helps Elena isolate compromised systems by detecting their communication with malicious external servers, even when attackers are using encryption or obfuscation techniques.

4. **IoC (Indicators of Compromise) Extraction**  
   Build a system to automatically extract and format potential IoCs (IP addresses, domains, hashes) from analyzed traffic. This allows Elena to quickly generate shareable threat intelligence that can be distributed to other security teams or fed into defensive systems to prevent similar attacks elsewhere.

5. **Incident Containment Assistance**  
   Create functionality that suggests specific traffic blocking rules based on detected malicious communications. This feature is vital during active incidents as it helps Elena rapidly implement containment measures to stop ongoing attacks while minimizing disruption to legitimate business operations.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be testable with mock network traffic data fixtures
- Attack pattern recognition algorithms must be testable with known malicious traffic samples
- Timeline reconstruction must be verifiable with timestamped event sequences
- IoC extraction must be validated against known-good extraction results
- Containment rule generation must be tested for accuracy and proper syntax

### Performance Expectations
- Process at least 1GB of PCAP data in under 5 minutes on standard hardware
- Attack pattern matching must complete within 30 seconds for 100MB of traffic data
- Timeline reconstruction should process 10,000 network events in under 10 seconds
- IoC extraction should handle at least 500 potential indicators per minute
- All analysis functions should support incremental processing for real-time analysis

### Integration Points
- Support for reading standard PCAP/PCAPNG capture files
- Export IoCs in STIX/TAXII 2.1 format for threat intelligence sharing
- Generate firewall rules compatible with major platforms (iptables, pf, Windows Firewall)
- Import custom attack signatures in Suricata/Snort format
- API for integration with incident management systems

### Key Constraints
- Must work with offline captures when network connectivity is restricted
- All analysis must be performed locally without external API dependencies
- No sensitive data should be transmitted outside the analysis environment
- Processing should be possible on systems with 8GB RAM or more
- Must handle malformed packets without crashing

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The Incident Response Network Analyzer should provide the following core functionality:

1. **Traffic Analysis Engine**
   - Parse and decode network protocols from captured traffic data
   - Support for TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, TLS, and other common protocols
   - Handle fragmented packets and session reconstruction
   - Provide statistical analysis of connection metadata

2. **Attack Detection System**
   - Signature-based detection using known attack patterns
   - Heuristic-based detection for identifying suspicious behaviors
   - Anomaly detection for identifying deviations from normal traffic
   - Support for custom detection rules

3. **Forensic Analysis Tools**
   - Session reconstruction to follow attack progression
   - Temporal analysis to create accurate event timelines
   - Extraction of files and artifacts from network streams
   - Correlation of related network activities

4. **Threat Intelligence Generation**
   - Automated extraction of potential IoCs
   - Classification of indicators by confidence and threat level
   - Formatting for sharing with other security systems
   - Deduplication and validation of extracted indicators

5. **Containment Support**
   - Analysis of network communication patterns to identify isolation points
   - Generation of containment rules for various security controls
   - Impact assessment for proposed containment actions
   - Prioritization of containment recommendations

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of protocol parsing and decoding
- Correctness of attack pattern recognition
- Precision of timeline reconstruction
- Completeness of IoC extraction
- Effectiveness of containment recommendations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Analyzing a captured PCAP file of a known malware infection
- Reconstructing the timeline of a multi-stage attack
- Detecting and analyzing command-and-control communications
- Extracting and formatting IoCs from an incident for sharing
- Generating containment rules for an active compromise

### Performance Benchmarks
- Process at least 100 packets per second on reference hardware
- Complete full analysis of a 1GB PCAP file in under 5 minutes
- Extract at least 95% of known IoCs from test traffic samples
- Generate timeline reconstruction with millisecond precision
- Produce containment rules within 5 seconds of detection

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of corrupt PCAP files
- Dealing with encrypted traffic and partial visibility
- Processing extremely large capture files (10GB+)
- Managing high-cardinality data (many unique IPs/domains)
- Handling of non-standard or custom protocols

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage for core functionality
- 100% coverage for IoC extraction and formatting
- 95% coverage for attack pattern recognition
- 90% coverage for timeline reconstruction
- 95% coverage for containment rule generation

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The Incident Response Network Analyzer implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It can accurately identify at least 90% of known attack patterns in test network captures
2. It successfully reconstructs attack timelines with correct event sequencing
3. It correctly identifies command-and-control communication with 85% or higher accuracy
4. It extracts valid IoCs with at least 90% accuracy and minimal false positives
5. It generates effective containment rules that would block malicious traffic without disrupting legitimate communications

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Project Setup and Environment

To set up the project environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project in development mode with `uv pip install -e .`
4. Install development dependencies including pytest-json-report

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY for project completion:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file serves as verification that all functionality works as required and all tests pass successfully. This file must be generated and included with your submission.
