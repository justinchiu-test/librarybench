# Household Financial Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive family finance management system designed specifically for household financial managers who need to coordinate multiple accounts, track shared expenses, and manage finances for a family unit. The system emphasizes collaborative financial management, budget adherence, and planning for family-specific life goals.

## Persona Description
Maria manages the finances for her household, tracking spending for a family of five with diverse needs and activities. She needs to coordinate multiple accounts, track shared expenses, and ensure the family stays on budget while saving for future goals.

## Key Requirements
1. **Family member sub-accounts allowing individual tracking within the household**  
   Maria needs to create and manage separate financial profiles for each family member while maintaining a unified view of household finances. These sub-accounts should track individual spending patterns, allowances, and personal savings goals while rolling up into the overall family financial picture.

2. **Allowance and chore payment management for teaching children financial responsibility**  
   As a parent teaching financial literacy, Maria needs a system to track chore assignments, completion status, and associated payments to children. This includes scheduling recurring allowances, recording one-time rewards, and managing each child's accumulated savings, spending, and giving allocations.

3. **Shared expense allocation automatically splitting costs between family members**  
   Many household expenses need to be appropriately divided among family members. Maria requires functionality to define expense-sharing rules (equal splits, percentage-based, or custom allocations) and automatically distribute shared costs like groceries, utilities, and family activities to the appropriate accounts.

4. **Life event planning tools for education savings, home purchases, and family vacations**  
   The family has multiple long-term financial goals, including college education for the children, a future home renovation, and annual family vacations. Maria needs specialized planning tools that account for timeframes, prioritization of goals, and appropriate savings strategies for each life event.

5. **Household inventory management tracking high-value assets and depreciation**  
   The family owns numerous valuable assets that represent a significant portion of their net worth. Maria needs to maintain a detailed inventory of these items, including purchase dates, values, warranty information, depreciation calculations, and replacement cost estimates for insurance purposes.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements:**
  - All account manipulation and transaction functions must have comprehensive test coverage
  - Goal planning calculations must be tested against established financial formulas
  - Automated transaction categorization must achieve >90% accuracy in tests
  - Database integrity and rollback capabilities must be thoroughly tested

- **Performance Expectations:**
  - System must handle at least 10,000 transactions across all family accounts
  - Report generation must complete in under 3 seconds
  - Expense categorization and allocation must process in under 1 second
  - System must support concurrent access from different family members

- **Integration Points:**
  - Import functionality for bank and credit card statements
  - Export capabilities for tax preparation purposes
  - Backup and restore functionality for data protection
  - Optional calendar integration for financial event scheduling

- **Key Constraints:**
  - Multi-user design with appropriate permission levels
  - Data must remain consistent across concurrent operations
  - Calculations must be accurate to 2 decimal places for currency
  - System must maintain audit history of all financial changes

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The system must implement these core components:

1. **Family Account Management System:**
   - Primary account with administrative capabilities
   - Sub-accounts with configurable permissions
   - Shared and individual account views
   - Transaction tracking at both individual and household levels

2. **Allowance and Chore Tracking:**
   - Chore definition with customizable reward values
   - Scheduling system for recurring and one-time chores
   - Completion verification workflow
   - Automated reward disbursement
   - Savings, spending, and charitable giving allocation

3. **Expense Sharing Engine:**
   - Customizable allocation rules
   - Multiple allocation methods (equal, percentage, fixed amount)
   - Automatic splitting of shared expenses
   - Split transaction history and reconciliation

4. **Life Event Planning System:**
   - Goal definition with target amounts and dates
   - Progress tracking toward multiple concurrent goals
   - Savings rate calculations and recommendations
   - "What-if" scenario modeling for different approaches
   - Goal prioritization and resource allocation

5. **Household Inventory Tracker:**
   - Asset recording with detailed metadata
   - Valuation models including depreciation
   - Warranty and maintenance tracking
   - Insurance coverage analysis
   - Replacement planning

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities to Verify:**
  - Creation and management of family member sub-accounts
  - Proper allocation of shared expenses according to defined rules
  - Accurate tracking of allowances, chores, and associated payments
  - Progress calculations for financial goals
  - Household asset valuation and depreciation

- **Critical User Scenarios:**
  - Adding a new family member to the financial system
  - Recording and allocating a shared family expense
  - Managing a child's completed chores and allowance payments
  - Setting up and tracking progress toward college savings goals
  - Adding and updating household inventory items

- **Performance Benchmarks:**
  - System must maintain performance with 5+ years of transaction history
  - Shared expense allocation must process in under 500ms
  - Report generation must scale linearly with data volume
  - Batch imports of 100+ transactions must complete in under 10 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions:**
  - Handling negative account balances
  - Managing deleted family members with historical transactions
  - Recovering from incomplete transaction splits
  - Resolving conflicts in concurrent edits
  - Maintaining data integrity during system interruption

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics:**
  - Core financial functions: minimum 90% coverage
  - Data management functions: minimum 85% coverage
  - Expense allocation algorithms: minimum 95% coverage
  - Goal calculation functions: minimum 90% coverage

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
- The system correctly manages finances for multiple family members with appropriate permissions
- Allowances and chores are tracked accurately with proper reward disbursement
- Shared expenses are allocated correctly according to configurable rules
- Life event financial planning provides accurate projections and progress tracking
- Household inventory is properly maintained with accurate valuations and depreciation
- All operations maintain data integrity across the family financial ecosystem
- System performance meets or exceeds the specified benchmarks
- All tests pass without manual intervention

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Development Environment Setup
1. Set up a virtual environment using `uv venv`
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`
4. Run tests with:
   ```
