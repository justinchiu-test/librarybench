# ResearchBrain: Personal Knowledge Management for Academic Researchers

## Project Overview

ResearchBrain is a comprehensive knowledge management system specifically designed for academic researchers. It helps researchers organize complex scientific literature, track research projects, and maintain structured connections between research notes, publications, and grant proposals.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Citation-aware note linking**
   - Automatically connects notes to referenced academic papers
   - Enables bidirectional navigation between research notes and source materials
   - Supports multiple citation formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)

2. **Research question tracking**
   - Maps research hypotheses to supporting and contradicting evidence
   - Evaluates strength of evidence with customizable indicators
   - Visualizes research landscapes with knowledge gaps

3. **Grant proposal workspaces**
   - Organizes knowledge subsets for funding applications
   - Curates relevant research findings and preliminary data
   - Generates structured reports for grant applications

4. **Experiment logging templates**
   - Provides structured templates for different experiment types
   - Ensures consistent documentation of methods and results
   - Supports scientific reproducibility

5. **Collaborative annotation importing**
   - Imports and integrates comments from collaborators
   - Maintains organization integrity of knowledge structure
   - Tracks attribution of ideas and contributions

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

- **Data Models**: Flexible Pydantic models for all knowledge entities
- **Storage System**: Plain-text YAML storage with bidirectional linking
- **Knowledge Graph**: NetworkX implementation for relationship tracking
- **Citation System**: Parsers and formatters for academic references
- **Template System**: Jinja2-based templates for structured experiments
- **CLI Interface**: Rich-based command-line interface for all operations

### System Architecture

ResearchBrain follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:
