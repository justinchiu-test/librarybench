# ThesisLab - A Knowledge Management System for Graduate Students

## Overview
ThesisLab is a specialized knowledge management system designed for graduate students working on theses and dissertations. It helps organize theoretical frameworks, track argument development, manage extensive literature reviews, and structure complex academic projects. The system enables scholars to process hundreds of sources while developing coherent arguments and theoretical connections.

## Persona Description
Miguel is pursuing a PhD in philosophy, processing hundreds of sources while developing his dissertation framework. He needs to track theoretical influences, evolving arguments, and thematic connections across a vast body of literature.

## Key Requirements
1. **Argument mapping** - Create a system for visualizing and managing the logical structure of developing philosophical positions. This feature is critical for Miguel to articulate complex philosophical arguments, identify logical gaps, track premises and conclusions, and ensure argumentative coherence across his dissertation. The system must support hierarchical argument structures, identification of logical fallacies, and relationship mapping between competing arguments.

2. **Theoretical lineage tracking** - Implement functionality to document and visualize the evolution of ideas through different thinkers and philosophical traditions. This is essential for Miguel to situate his work within the broader philosophical discourse, demonstrate comprehensive understanding of his field's intellectual history, and identify his unique scholarly contribution. The system should support multi-generational influence mapping and identification of conceptual drift across different philosophers.

3. **Quotation management** - Develop a robust system for storing, retrieving, and contextualizing quotations with precise source attribution. This capability allows Miguel to maintain academic integrity, build arguments on textual evidence, and quickly access supporting material during writing. The system must preserve contextual information, maintain bibliographic connections, and support multi-format citation styles appropriate for philosophical scholarship.

4. **Dissertation section planning** - Create tools to link dissertation outline elements directly to supporting notes, arguments, and source materials. This feature helps Miguel maintain structural coherence across a lengthy document developed over years, ensure sufficient supporting evidence for each section, and manage the complex interdependencies between dissertation components. The system should support adaptive outlining as research evolves.

5. **Advisor feedback integration** - Implement mechanisms to capture, organize, and integrate feedback from academic advisors and seminar discussions within the knowledge structure. This capability is vital for Miguel to track evolving guidance, document the iterative development of his ideas through academic discourse, and demonstrate responsiveness to scholarly critique. The system should support annotation of existing content with feedback and version tracking of idea development.

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - All core functionality must be implemented through well-defined APIs
  - Argument structures must be representable as serializable data structures
  - Theoretical lineage tracking must support verifiable relationship validation
  - Quotation management must enforce referential integrity between quotes and sources
  - Dissertation planning tools must maintain structural validation for outline coherence
  - All components must support deterministic testing with reproducible results

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - System must efficiently handle knowledge bases with 5,000+ notes and 1,000+ sources
  - Argument mapping visualization calculations must complete in under 2 seconds
  - Full-text search across all content must return results in under 1 second
  - Theoretical lineage traversal operations must handle deeply nested relationships (10+ levels)
  - Background indexing of new content must not impact interactive operations

- **Integration Points**:
  - Support for importing bibliographic data from standard formats (BibTeX, RIS, etc.)
  - Export capabilities for argument maps and theoretical lineages (JSON, CSV, plain text)
  - Integration with academic citation standards (Chicago, MLA, APA)
  - Markdown-based note format for maximum portability
  - Support for embedding structured metadata using YAML front matter

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All data must be stored locally in plain text formats without cloud dependencies
  - System must operate efficiently with limited memory resources
  - No user interface components - all functionality must be accessible via API
  - Implementation must be cross-platform compatible
  - Support for git-based version control of the knowledge base

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
ThesisLab needs to implement these core capabilities:

1. **Argument Representation System**: A framework for modeling philosophical arguments with:
   - Premise and conclusion structure representation
   - Support for different argument types (deductive, inductive, abductive)
   - Hierarchical nesting of sub-arguments
   - Identification of logical relationships and potential fallacies
   - Text-based visualization of argument structures

2. **Knowledge Graph Engine**: A system for representing intellectual influence and theoretical evolution:
   - Entity representation for thinkers, concepts, and theoretical frameworks
   - Temporal relationship modeling to track idea evolution
   - Bidirectional linking between related concepts
   - Path analysis for identifying connections between seemingly disparate ideas
   - Support for conflicting interpretations of influence

3. **Citation and Quotation Manager**: A sophisticated system for academic source management:
   - Storage and retrieval of quotations with full context
   - Bibliographic metadata management adhering to academic standards
   - Multiple citation format support
   - Source credibility and relevance tracking
   - Integration between quotes and their application in arguments

4. **Dissertation Structure Manager**: A framework for organizing large academic documents:
   - Hierarchical outline representation with arbitrary nesting
   - Bidirectional linking between outline elements and supporting material
   - Coverage analysis to identify under-supported sections
   - Progress tracking for different dissertation components
   - Refactoring tools for reorganizing structure as research evolves

5. **Academic Feedback System**: A mechanism for integrating scholarly discourse:
   - Annotation capabilities for existing notes and arguments
   - Versioning of ideas to track evolution through feedback
   - Classification of feedback by type and source
   - Implementation status tracking for suggested changes
   - Integration of feedback into the overall knowledge structure

## Testing Requirements
The implementation must include comprehensive tests that verify all aspects of the system:

- **Key Functionalities to Verify**:
  - Argument mapping correctly represents complex philosophical arguments with premises and conclusions
  - Theoretical lineage tracking accurately captures influence relationships between thinkers
  - Quotation management maintains proper attribution and contextual information
  - Dissertation planning tools correctly link outline elements to supporting materials
  - Advisor feedback is properly integrated and tracked within the knowledge structure

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Building and revising complex philosophical arguments with multiple premises and objections
  - Mapping the intellectual history of a philosophical concept across different thinkers
  - Managing and retrieving quotations from hundreds of sources with proper citation
  - Planning and reorganizing dissertation structure as research evolves
  - Incorporating advisor feedback into existing arguments and theoretical frameworks

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - System must handle knowledge bases with at least 10,000 notes without performance degradation
  - Argument visualization calculations must complete in under 2 seconds for arguments with 50+ components
  - Full-text search must return results in under 1 second across 5GB of text

  - 100% coverage for citation management functionality
  - 100% coverage for argument structure validation
  - 95% branch coverage for theoretical lineage operations
  - 95% coverage for dissertation structure management

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
