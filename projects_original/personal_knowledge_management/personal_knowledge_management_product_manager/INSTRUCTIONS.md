# ProductMind - A Knowledge Management System for Product Managers

## Overview
ProductMind is a specialized knowledge management system designed for product managers who need to organize customer feedback, track feature requests, monitor competitive intelligence, document strategic decisions, and map stakeholder perspectives. The system enables product professionals to transform diverse inputs into coherent product strategies while maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base of market and user insights.

## Persona Description
Sophia oversees a complex software product with multiple stakeholders, feature requests, and market research inputs. She needs to track user feedback, competitive analysis, and strategic decisions to guide product development.

## Key Requirements
1. **Customer feedback clustering** - Develop an intelligent system for grouping similar requests and pain points from diverse user feedback channels. This capability is essential for Sophia to identify patterns in user needs, prioritize product improvements based on frequency and impact, and communicate user insights effectively to development teams. The clustering must work with unstructured feedback from multiple sources while connecting related issues across different expression formats.

2. **Feature prioritization framework** - Create a structured methodology for linking user requests to strategic business objectives. This functionality allows Sophia to make data-driven decisions about product roadmaps, justify development priorities to stakeholders, and ensure that engineering efforts align with company goals and user needs. The framework must support multiple prioritization models and customizable evaluation criteria for feature assessment.

3. **Competitive intelligence tracking** - Implement a comprehensive system for monitoring market positioning against alternatives. This feature enables Sophia to track competitor feature sets and pricing strategies, identify market gaps and opportunities, and make informed decisions about product differentiation. The tracking system must maintain up-to-date competitive landscapes while supporting comparison across multiple product dimensions.

4. **Decision documentation** - Design a robust framework for preserving context and rationale behind product choices. This capability helps Sophia maintain institutional memory for important decisions, demonstrate thoughtful consideration to stakeholders, and ensure consistency in product strategy over time. The documentation must capture both the decision outcomes and the underlying reasoning, including alternatives considered and trade-offs evaluated.

5. **Stakeholder perspective mapping** - Create tools for systematically recording different viewpoints on product direction. This functionality is vital for Sophia to balance competing priorities from various organizational roles, identify potential conflicts early in the planning process, and develop product strategies that address diverse needs. The mapping should support perspective categorization by stakeholder type and integration with decision-making processes.

## Technical Requirements
