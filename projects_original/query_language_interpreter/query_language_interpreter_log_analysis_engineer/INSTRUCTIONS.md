# Distributed Log Analysis Query Interpreter

## Overview
This specialized Query Language Interpreter enables cloud application engineers to analyze distributed system logs in various formats without centralization. The interpreter provides optimized pattern matching for log analysis, event sequence detection, contextual log filtering, session reconstruction, and distributed query execution across multiple servers, making it an ideal tool for troubleshooting complex cloud applications.

## Persona Description
Sophia troubleshoots cloud application issues by analyzing distributed system logs in various formats. She needs to perform complex queries across log files without transferring them to a centralized database.

## Key Requirements
1. **Regular expression pattern matching optimized for log file formats**: Provides high-performance regular expression capabilities specifically tuned for common log formats (JSON, syslog, Apache, nginx, custom application logs), enabling efficient filtering and extraction of relevant log entries across terabytes of log data.

2. **Event sequence detection identifying specific patterns of events across time**: Allows defining and detecting sequential patterns of related events that indicate specific system behaviors, critical for identifying transaction flows, error cascades, and request paths through distributed microservices.

3. **Log level filtering with context preservation showing surrounding entries**: Enables filtering by log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) while automatically preserving surrounding log entries from before and after each match, providing critical context for understanding the circumstances leading to and following important events.

4. **Session reconstruction grouping related operations by request ID or user session**: Automatically correlates and groups log entries belonging to the same logical session or request across multiple services and log sources, essential for tracing user interactions or API requests through distributed system components.

5. **Distributed query execution processing logs directly on multiple remote servers**: Executes queries in parallel across multiple servers where logs are stored, aggregating results without requiring log centralization, ideal for environments where log volumes make centralized collection impractical or where data locality is important.

## Technical Requirements
### Testability Requirements
- All pattern matching algorithms must be testable with standard log file formats
- Event sequence detection must be verifiable with predefined event chains
- Context preservation must be tested with various window sizes and conditions
- Session reconstruction must be validated across fragmented and out-of-order logs
- Distributed execution must be testable on a single machine using simulated nodes

### Performance Expectations
- Must process logs at rates exceeding 100MB/second on standard server hardware
- Regular expression matching should utilize optimized algorithms for log-specific patterns
- Sequential scanning performance should scale linearly with log volume
- Memory usage should remain constant regardless of total log size by using streaming processing
- Distributed query execution should achieve near-linear scaling with additional nodes

### Integration Points
- Remote execution capability via SSH or agent-based architecture
- Support for reading standard log formats (syslog, JSON, CSV, custom formats)
- Optional integration with log aggregation systems (ELK, Graylog, Splunk) as data sources
- Result export capability to common analysis formats
- Alert system integration for triggering notifications based on query results

### Key Constraints
- Must operate without requiring log centralization or movement
- Must function with read-only access to log files
- Should minimize network transfer by processing data where it resides
- Must handle logs with inconsistent timestamps or formats
- Should operate without requiring root/administrator access

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

3. **Event Analysis Framework**:
   - Temporal sequence pattern definition and detection
   - Correlation of events across different log sources
   - Time window and sliding window analysis
   - Anomaly and outlier detection in event patterns

4. **Session Management**:

## Testing Requirements
### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Accuracy of regular expression matching against various log formats
- Correct identification of event sequences with precise ordering
- Proper context preservation around matched log entries
- Accurate session reconstruction across fragmented logs
- Correct result aggregation from distributed query execution

### Critical User Scenarios
- Troubleshooting application errors by analyzing error logs with context
- Tracing user requests through multiple microservices
- Identifying performance bottlenecks through timing analysis
- Detecting security incidents through pattern recognition
- Analyzing system behavior during outages or degraded performance

### Performance Benchmarks
- Regular expression matching should process at least 1GB of log data per minute
- Event sequence detection should handle at least 10 million log entries with sub-minute response times
- Session reconstruction should process 100,000 sessions across distributed logs in under 5 minutes
- Distributed queries should achieve 80% efficiency compared to theoretical maximum parallel performance
- Query response time should not exceed 30 seconds for common analysis tasks on typical log volumes

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling of logs with missing or corrupted timestamps
- Proper behavior with extremely large log files (>100GB)
- Correct operation with interleaved logs from multiple processes
- Graceful handling of network interruptions during distributed queries
- Appropriate treatment of logs with inconsistent formatting or field values

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 90% code coverage across all modules
- 100% coverage for regular expression and pattern matching components
- All distributed execution code paths must be explicitly tested
- Tests must cover all supported log formats and parsing edge cases
- Performance tests must verify scaling behavior with large datasets

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

2. Accurately detect predefined event sequences across distributed logs, confirmed by tests with known event patterns
3. Properly preserve context around matched log entries, demonstrated with tests of different context window sizes
4. Correctly reconstruct sessions across fragmented and distributed logs, validated through tests with known session patterns
5. Execute queries across multiple data sources with proper result aggregation, verified by distributed execution tests
