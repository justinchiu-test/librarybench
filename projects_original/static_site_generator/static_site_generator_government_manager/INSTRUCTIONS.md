# Accessible Government Information Portal Generator

A specialized static site generator designed for government agencies to publish regulatory information, public notices, and community resources in a highly accessible, standards-compliant format.

## Overview

This project implements a Python library for generating government information websites that prioritize accessibility, compliance with regulatory standards, searchable document repositories, and multilingual support. It focuses on the needs of government content managers who must publish official information that meets strict compliance requirements while serving diverse community needs.

## Persona Description

Miguel works for a municipal government agency and needs to publish regulatory information, public notices, and community resources in an accessible format that meets compliance requirements.

## Key Requirements

1. **Accessibility Compliance Checking**: Implement comprehensive tools for ensuring generated content meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards throughout the site.
   - Critical for Miguel because government websites must comply with accessibility regulations, and non-compliance can result in legal issues and exclude citizens from accessing vital information.
   - Must validate against WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum with automated testing and reporting.

2. **Document Repository**: Create a structured, searchable system for organizing and presenting public records, forms, and official documents with proper categorization.
   - Essential for Miguel because government agencies must provide transparent access to public documents, organized in a way that citizens can easily find what they need.
   - Should include metadata, versioning, and powerful search capabilities.

3. **Legal Notice Templates**: Develop standardized templates for official announcements, public notices, and regulatory information with proper formatting and structure.
   - Important for Miguel because government communications often require specific formats and legal language to be valid, and consistency is essential across notices.
   - Must include dated archives and proper citation information.

4. **Multi-Language Content Management**: Implement a comprehensive system for managing content in multiple languages with appropriate translation workflows.
   - Valuable for Miguel because government information must be accessible to all community members, including those with limited English proficiency.
   - Should maintain synchronization between translated versions and indicate translation status.

5. **PDF Generation**: Create functionality for generating printer-friendly, accessible PDF versions of online content for official documents and forms.
   - Critical for Miguel because many government processes still require printable forms and official documents that can be downloaded, printed, and submitted.
   - Must generate PDF/A compliant documents that maintain accessibility features.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All components must be individually testable through well-defined interfaces
- Support automated accessibility testing against WCAG standards
- Validate generated PDFs for compliance with accessibility standards
- Test multi-language implementations with various character sets
- Verify document repository search functionality with comprehensive test datasets

### Performance Expectations
- Accessibility validation should complete for 100+ pages in under 60 seconds
- Document repository searches should return results in under 300ms
- Multi-language site generation should process 5+ languages efficiently
- PDF generation should create documents at a rate of at least 10 pages per second
- Full site generation for a typical agency site (500+ pages) should complete in under 5 minutes

### Integration Points
- Accessibility testing tools and validators
- PDF generation libraries with accessibility support
- Translation management systems and workflows
- Document indexing and search engines
- Compliance reporting and validation tools

### Key Constraints
- IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.
- Must comply with relevant government regulations for web accessibility (Section 508, ADA, etc.)
- Must generate complete accessibility reports for compliance documentation
- Must support all required languages for the target community
- Document repository must maintain proper security controls for public vs. restricted content
- Output must provide official, citable versions of government information

### Development Environment Setup

To set up your development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment using UV:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. CRITICAL: When testing, you must generate the pytest_results.json file:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

This file is MANDATORY proof that all tests pass and must be included with your implementation.
