# Database Performance Monitoring System

A specialized monitoring solution focused on database performance metrics, query analysis, connection management, storage planning, and backup verification.

## Overview

This implementation of PyMonitor is specifically designed for database administrators, providing detailed insights into database performance, query optimization opportunities, connection pool management, storage growth patterns, and backup operations to ensure database reliability and performance.

## Persona Description

Dr. Chen manages database systems supporting critical applications. He needs detailed insights into database performance and resource utilization patterns to optimize queries and prevent outages.

## Key Requirements

1. **Database-Specific Metrics Collection**
   - Collect and analyze metrics from major database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)
   - Monitor key performance indicators such as query execution time, cache hit ratios, and lock statistics
   - Track database instance health including replication lag, deadlocks, and index utilization
   - Support custom metric collection for specialized database configurations
   - Monitor database resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
   - This is critical because database-specific metrics provide insights that generic system monitoring cannot, enabling precise performance tuning and early problem detection.

2. **Query Performance Tracking**
   - Identify slow-running or resource-intensive database queries
   - Track query execution plans and changes over time
   - Provide historical query performance trends for comparison
   - Detect schema or index changes that impact query performance
   - Generate optimization recommendations based on query patterns
   - This is critical because poorly performing queries often account for the majority of database performance issues and can significantly impact application responsiveness.

3. **Connection Pool Saturation Monitoring**
   - Track database connection utilization across application servers
   - Monitor connection pool health, including wait times and timeouts
   - Identify connection leaks and inefficient connection usage patterns
   - Provide alerts for approaching connection limits
   - Correlate connection pool issues with application behavior
   - This is critical because connection management problems can lead to application instability and are often difficult to diagnose without specific monitoring.

4. **Storage Growth Forecasting**
   - Track database storage usage and growth patterns
   - Predict when storage thresholds will be reached
   - Analyze table-level and index-level growth trends
   - Identify abnormal growth patterns that may indicate issues
   - Generate capacity planning recommendations based on historical data
   - This is critical because unexpected storage exhaustion is a common cause of database outages, and proactive capacity planning is essential for ensuring continuous operation.

5. **Backup Operation Verification**
   - Monitor database backup processes for successful completion
   - Verify backup integrity and recoverability
   - Track backup sizes and completion times
   - Alert on missed or failed backup operations
   - Maintain backup history and compliance status
   - This is critical because ensuring valid, recoverable backups is essential for disaster recovery and business continuity, yet backup failures often go undetected until recovery is needed.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All database monitoring components must be testable with mock database engines
- Query performance monitoring must be verifiable with simulated query workloads
- Connection pool tracking must be testable with simulated connection patterns
- Storage forecasting algorithms must be validated with historical growth data
- Backup verification must be testable with mock backup processes and results

### Performance Expectations
- Minimal impact on monitored database systems (less than 1% overhead)
- Support for monitoring at least 100 database instances simultaneously
- Ability to track at least 10,000 unique queries per database
- Storage forecasting with at least 90% accuracy for 30-day predictions
- Connection pool monitoring with sub-second precision
- Backup verification within 5 minutes of backup completion

### Integration Points
- Database engines via native monitoring APIs (MySQL Performance Schema, pg_stat_statements, etc.)
- Database JDBC/ODBC drivers for connection monitoring
- Storage systems and volume managers
- Backup software and processes
- Database replication systems
- Application servers for connection pool correlation

### Key Constraints

- Should support both on-premises and cloud-hosted databases
- Must handle database version upgrades gracefully

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

   - Performance trend tracking
   - Anomaly detection for query behavior
   - Optimization recommendation engine

3. **Connection Manager**
   - Connection pool tracking across application servers
   - Usage pattern analysis
   - Leak detection and alerting
   - Connection wait time monitoring
   - Application-database connection correlation

4. **Storage Capacity Planner**
   - Database size tracking and trending
   - Growth pattern analysis and forecasting
   - Table and index level growth monitoring
   - Anomaly detection for unexpected growth
   - Capacity recommendation engine

5. **Backup Validation System**

- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
