# Healthcare Compliance Monitoring System

A specialized monitoring platform designed for healthcare environments that ensures system reliability, regulatory compliance, and patient care continuity.

## Overview

This implementation of PyMonitor focuses on the unique monitoring needs of healthcare IT environments, emphasizing HIPAA compliance verification, scheduled downtime management, medical device integration, patient impact assessment, and audit-ready reporting to support the strict uptime and regulatory requirements of medical practices.

## Persona Description

Dr. Patel maintains systems for a medical practice that must meet strict uptime and compliance requirements. He needs reliable monitoring with audit trails and verification of security controls.

## Key Requirements

1. **HIPAA Compliance Verification**
   - Monitor and verify security controls required for HIPAA compliance
   - Track access patterns to Protected Health Information (PHI) systems
   - Detect potential security violations and unauthorized access attempts
   - Generate compliance assessment reports for audit preparation
   - Maintain evidence of continuous monitoring for regulatory requirements
   - This is critical because healthcare organizations must maintain strict compliance with HIPAA regulations to protect patient data and avoid significant penalties.

2. **Scheduled Downtime Management**
   - Implement planned maintenance windows during non-patient-facing hours
   - Verify system availability during critical operational periods
   - Track maintenance activities and completion status
   - Automatically test critical functions after maintenance
   - Provide early warnings for maintenance overruns into operational hours
   - This is critical because healthcare systems require regular maintenance but must maintain strict availability during patient care hours to ensure continuous access to critical medical information.

3. **Medical Device Integration Monitoring**
   - Monitor connectivity between information systems and medical devices
   - Track data flow integrity from devices to electronic health records
   - Detect device communication failures or data transmission errors
   - Verify proper operation of interface engines and integration points
   - Support various medical device communication protocols
   - This is critical because healthcare environments rely on data from specialized medical equipment, and integration failures can impact patient care and clinical decision-making.

4. **Patient Impact Estimation**
   - Correlate system issues with affected appointments and patient services
   - Prioritize alerts based on potential impact to patient care
   - Estimate number of affected patients during system degradation
   - Track incident resolution time against patient care schedules
   - Provide decision support for contingency plan activation
   - This is critical because healthcare IT teams need to understand how technical issues translate to patient care impact to properly prioritize response efforts.

5. **Audit-Ready Reporting**
   - Generate comprehensive documentation for compliance certifications
   - Provide tamper-evident logs of system monitoring activities
   - Support attestation requirements for various healthcare regulations
   - Maintain historical evidence of security controls and monitoring
   - Produce executive summaries for leadership and audit reviewers
   - This is critical because healthcare organizations undergo frequent audits and must demonstrate continuous compliance with various regulations and standards.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All compliance monitoring must be verifiable against HIPAA requirements
- Downtime management must be testable with simulated maintenance scenarios
- Medical device integration must be testable with mock device interfaces
- Patient impact estimation must work with test appointment and schedule data
- Audit reporting must generate verifiable documentation from test data

### Performance Expectations
- Support for monitoring at least 100 clinical and administrative systems
- Process and correlate events within 30 seconds of occurrence
- Generate compliance reports within 5 minutes of request
- Track at least 50 integrated medical devices
- Maintain at least 7 years of auditable monitoring history (with appropriate archiving)
- Minimal system impact (less than 2% CPU, 100MB RAM) on monitored systems

### Integration Points
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
- Medical devices and integration engines
- Appointment scheduling systems
- Authentication and access control systems
- Audit logging infrastructure
- Backup and disaster recovery systems
- Compliance management platforms

### Key Constraints
- Must satisfy HIPAA Security Rule monitoring requirements
- Cannot impact performance of critical clinical systems
- Must maintain data privacy during monitoring
- Cannot store PHI within monitoring system
- Should operate without requiring additional hardware
- Must support various healthcare-specific systems and protocols
- Should minimize maintenance requirements for IT staff

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The system should consist of these core modules:

1. **Compliance Monitoring Engine**
   - Security control verification and assessment
   - Access pattern analysis and anomaly detection
   - Vulnerability and configuration compliance checking
   - Evidence collection and preservation
   - Regulatory requirement mapping and validation

2. **Maintenance Window Manager**
   - Downtime scheduling and notification
   - Critical period protection and verification
   - Activity tracking and status monitoring
   - Post-maintenance testing coordination
   - Contingency activation for extended outages

3. **Device Integration Monitor**
   - Medical device connectivity tracking
   - Interface engine monitoring
   - Data flow validation and integrity checking
   - Protocol support for common medical devices
   - Integration point mapping and dependency tracking

4. **Patient Care Impact Analyzer**
   - System-to-service dependency mapping
   - Appointment and schedule correlation
   - Impact severity classification
   - Patient notification recommendation
   - Contingency planning support

5. **Audit Documentation Generator**
   - Evidence collection and preservation
   - Report generation with compliance mapping

- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
