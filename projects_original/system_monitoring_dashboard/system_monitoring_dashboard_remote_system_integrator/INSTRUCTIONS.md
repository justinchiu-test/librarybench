# Remote-First Monitoring Framework

A resilient monitoring solution designed for systems in locations with limited connectivity, featuring offline operation and bandwidth optimization.

## Overview

This implementation of PyMonitor addresses the unique challenges of monitoring systems in remote locations with unreliable network connectivity. It emphasizes offline operation, bandwidth-efficient data transmission, alternative alerting methods, edge-based data processing, and resilient configuration management.

## Persona Description

Jamal configures and maintains systems for clients in remote locations with limited connectivity. He needs reliable monitoring that works even with intermittent internet access and provides historical data when connections are reestablished.

## Key Requirements

1. **Offline Operation with Store-and-Forward**
   - Implement local caching of metrics during connectivity gaps
   - Ensure data persistence across system reboots
   - Intelligently transmit historical data when connections are reestablished
   - Prioritize critical metrics during limited connectivity windows
   - Maintain accurate timestamps for delayed data to enable proper historical analysis
   - This is critical because remote systems experience frequent connectivity interruptions but still need complete monitoring history for troubleshooting and analysis.

2. **Bandwidth-Aware Communication**
   - Implement adaptive compression based on available bandwidth
   - Support configurable sampling rates that adjust to connection quality
   - Prioritize metric transmission based on importance and age
   - Monitor and report on bandwidth usage for planning purposes
   - Support differential data transmission to minimize redundant information
   - This is critical because remote locations often have expensive, metered, or extremely limited bandwidth that must be used efficiently.

3. **SMS Alerting for Critical Issues**
   - Integrate with SMS gateways for critical notifications
   - Support message batching to reduce SMS costs
   - Implement intelligent alert summarization to fit message size constraints
   - Provide two-way SMS communication for basic acknowledgment and control
   - Configure escalation paths when SMS delivery fails
   - This is critical because traditional alerting methods like email or web notifications may be unavailable during connectivity outages, but cellular networks often remain operational.

4. **Edge Summarization for Data Reduction**
   - Implement on-device data aggregation and summarization
   - Support configurable retention policies for raw vs. summarized data
   - Calculate key statistical measures locally before transmission
   - Detect and prioritize anomalies for immediate reporting
   - Enable progressive data resolution based on storage duration
   - This is critical because transmitting all raw monitoring data from remote locations is impractical, but losing valuable insights is unacceptable.

5. **Remote Configuration Updates**
   - Support queued configuration changes that apply when systems are reachable
   - Implement configuration versioning and conflict resolution
   - Provide rollback capabilities for failed configuration updates
   - Include configuration validation before application
   - Allow partial updates when complete configurations cannot be transmitted
   - This is critical because remote systems require configuration adjustments over time, but synchronous updates are often impossible due to connectivity limitations.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- All offline functionality must be testable with simulated connectivity interruptions
- Bandwidth optimization must be verifiable with simulated network conditions
- SMS integration must be testable with mock SMS gateways
- Edge processing algorithms must produce consistent, verifiable results
- Configuration management must be tested for consistency across disconnected periods

### Performance Expectations
- Minimal local storage requirements (maximum 5GB for 3 months of raw data)
- Bandwidth utilization reduction of at least 80% compared to standard monitoring
- Local processing overhead under 5% CPU and 100MB RAM
- SMS alerts must be generated within 30 seconds of critical events
- Configuration updates must apply within 5 minutes of reconnection

### Integration Points
- Cellular modems and SMS gateways
- Satellite communication systems (optional)
- Local storage systems with persistence
- Bandwidth measurement and quality detection
- Remote management systems
- Time synchronization services for accurate timestamping

### Key Constraints
- Must function on limited hardware (equivalent to Raspberry Pi or industrial IoT gateways)
- Must operate with severely constrained bandwidth (as low as 2G/EDGE connections)
- Must handle extended offline periods (days to weeks)
- Cannot rely on consistent power (should handle unexpected shutdowns)
- Must minimize data transfer costs on metered connections
- Must prioritize reliability over feature completeness

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
