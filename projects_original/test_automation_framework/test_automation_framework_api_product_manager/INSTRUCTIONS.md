# API Platform Testing Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for API platform product managers who oversee public APIs used by third-party developers and integrators. This framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities for API contracts, backward compatibility, developer experience, and platform reliability to ensure API quality and stability.

## Persona Description
Carlos oversees public APIs used by third-party developers and integrators. He needs comprehensive testing of API contracts, backward compatibility, and developer experience to ensure platform reliability.

## Key Requirements
1. **API contract validation ensuring endpoints behave according to published specifications**
   - Critical for maintaining trust with third-party developers who rely on documented behavior
   - Verifies that API implementations match OpenAPI/Swagger specifications exactly
   - Ensures consistent error handling, status codes, and response formats

2. **Backward compatibility verification detecting breaking changes between versions**
   - Prevents unintentional disruption to existing integrators when updating APIs
   - Identifies subtle breaking changes in parameters, responses, and behavior
   - Provides confidence when evolving APIs while maintaining compatibility promises

3. **Developer experience simulation testing the API from an integrator's perspective**
   - Validates that APIs are intuitive and follow industry best practices
   - Tests onboarding flows and first-time developer experiences
   - Ensures APIs behave consistently with documentation and examples

4. **Rate limiting and quota behavior validation under various usage patterns**
   - Verifies that API throttling behaves as specified under different load conditions
   - Tests fairness of rate limiting across different consumers
   - Ensures that quota enforcement and overage handling works correctly

5. **Documentation accuracy testing ensuring examples and specifications match actual behavior**
   - Prevents frustration caused by outdated or incorrect documentation
   - Verifies that all published examples execute successfully
   - Ensures documentation completeness for all API features and options

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Framework must support testing against multiple API versions simultaneously
  - Tests must verify both functional correctness and non-functional qualities
  - Framework must simulate various API consumer behaviors and patterns
  - Tests must validate both successful paths and error conditions comprehensively

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - API contract validation must process 100+ endpoints in < 2 minutes
  - Backward compatibility checks should complete within 5 minutes for major version comparisons
  - Developer experience simulations must execute end-to-end scenarios in < 30 seconds each
  - Rate limit testing must accurately simulate traffic patterns up to 10,000 requests per minute

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must integrate with API specification formats (OpenAPI/Swagger, RAML, GraphQL schemas)
  - Should work with API management platforms and gateways
  - Must support various authentication schemes (OAuth, API keys, JWT)
  - Should integrate with developer portal content management systems

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must work without privileged access to API internals
  - Framework must operate without causing API quota or rate limit issues
  - Solution should generate minimal load on production APIs during testing
  - Tests must be executable by product managers without deep technical expertise

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this test automation framework includes:

1. **API Specification Validator**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger compliance verification
   - Contract validation against implementations
   - Error response conformance testing
   - Edge case and boundary validation

2. **Compatibility Analysis Engine**
   - Semantic versioning rule enforcement
   - Binary and source compatibility checking
   - Deprecation and migration path validation
   - API evolution impact assessment

3. **Developer Journey Simulator**
   - First-time user experience testing
   - Documentation-to-implementation alignment
   - SDK compatibility verification
   - Error message clarity and actionability

4. **Rate Limit and Quota Tester**
   - Traffic pattern simulation and load generation
   - Throttling behavior verification
   - Quota enforcement and reset validation
   - Fair usage policy implementation testing

5. **Documentation Verification System**
   - Example code execution and validation
   - Documentation coverage analysis
   - Code snippet accuracy checking
   - Interactive documentation testing

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified**:
  - Accuracy of API contract validation against specifications
  - Reliability of backward compatibility verification between versions
  - Effectiveness of developer experience simulation
  - Correctness of rate limiting and quota enforcement behavior
  - Completeness of documentation accuracy testing

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - API product manager validating a new API against its specification
  - Comparing API versions to ensure backward compatibility
  - Testing the experience of a new developer integrating with the API
  - Verifying rate limiting behavior under various load conditions
  - Ensuring documentation examples match actual API implementation

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - API contract validation must achieve 99%+ accuracy for specification compliance
  - Compatibility testing must detect 100% of breaking changes with < 5% false positives
  - Developer experience simulation must cover 90%+ of typical integration scenarios
  - Rate limit testing must verify behaviors at 10-1000x normal traffic volumes
  - Documentation testing must execute 100% of published examples

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling API versioning via different mechanisms (URL, header, parameter)
  - Testing complex error conditions that are difficult to trigger
  - Appropriate behavior with deprecated but still supported API features
  - Correct operation with long-running or asynchronous API operations
  - Proper testing of paginated responses and large result sets

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - API contract validation: 100% coverage of specification elements
  - Backward compatibility verification: 95% coverage
  - Developer experience simulation: 90% coverage
  - Rate limiting and quota testing: 95% coverage
  - Documentation accuracy verification: 100% coverage of examples
  - Overall framework code coverage minimum: 95%

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. API implementations can be verified against their specifications with high accuracy
2. Breaking changes between API versions are reliably detected before release
3. The developer experience is thoroughly tested from an integrator's perspective
4. Rate limiting and quota behavior is validated under various usage patterns
5. Documentation accuracy is verified through automated example testing

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up your development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file MUST be generated and included as it is a critical requirement for project completion and verification.
