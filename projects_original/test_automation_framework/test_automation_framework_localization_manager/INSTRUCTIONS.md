# Internationalization and Localization Test Framework

## Overview
A specialized test automation framework designed for localization managers who coordinate product translation and adaptation for international markets. This framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities to verify that applications function correctly across different languages, regions, and cultural settings.

## Persona Description
Dr. Patel coordinates product translation and adaptation for international markets. He needs to verify that applications function correctly across different languages, regions, and cultural settings.

## Key Requirements
1. **Internationalization validation ensuring all user-facing text is properly externalized**
   - Critical for identifying hardcoded strings that can't be translated
   - Verifies that all text elements use translation mechanisms rather than static definitions
   - Enables complete localization coverage without developer intervention

2. **Pseudo-localization testing identifying potential layout and display issues before translation**
   - Reveals potential UI problems without waiting for actual translations
   - Simulates text expansion, different character sets, and bidirectional text
   - Provides early warning of localization problems during development

3. **Cultural appropriateness checking for colors, symbols, and imagery across markets**
   - Prevents unintentional cultural insensitivity or offensive content
   - Ensures that visual elements are appropriate for target markets
   - Identifies region-specific customizations needed for cultural alignment

4. **Right-to-left language support verification for bidirectional text handling**
   - Validates proper implementation of RTL layouts and text flow
   - Tests UI components in both LTR and RTL contexts
   - Ensures correct bidirectional text rendering in mixed content

5. **Regional format testing ensuring dates, numbers, and currencies display correctly by locale**
   - Verifies that numeric data follows local conventions (decimal separators, grouping)
   - Tests date and time formatting according to regional standards
   - Validates currency symbols, placement, and formatting across regions

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Framework must support testing with multiple language resource sets
  - Tests must verify content in various language and locale combinations
  - Framework must simulate different locale environments programmatically
  - Tests must validate both static and dynamic localized content

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Internationalization validation must process all UI text in < 5 minutes
  - Pseudo-localization transformation must occur in near real-time for interactive testing
  - Cultural appropriateness checks should complete in < 10 seconds per locale
  - Regional format validation must test 100+ format combinations in < 2 minutes

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must integrate with translation management systems and resource files
  - Should work with standard internationalization libraries and frameworks
  - Must support various resource file formats (properties, JSON, XLIFF, etc.)
  - Should integrate with continuous localization workflows

- **Key Constraints**:
  - Implementation must work without requiring specific language expertise
  - Framework must operate without modifying application source code
  - Solution should accommodate various approaches to internationalization
  - Tests must be executable in any locale environment regardless of system settings

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of this test automation framework includes:

1. **Internationalization Resource Validator**
   - String externalization verification
   - Resource completeness analysis
   - Translation coverage measurement
   - Context and variable usage validation

2. **Pseudo-localization Engine**
   - Automated text transformation with expansion
   - Character set substitution and simulation
   - Bidirectional text emulation
   - Accent and diacritic injection

3. **Cultural Sensitivity Analyzer**
   - Cultural context and appropriateness validation
   - Symbol and imagery verification
   - Color usage and meaning analysis
   - Regional customization requirement identification

4. **Bidirectional Text Testing System**
   - RTL layout verification
   - Mixed directional text handling validation
   - Text alignment and flow testing
   - Bidirectional algorithm implementation verification

5. **Locale-specific Format Validator**
   - Date and time format testing
   - Number formatting verification
   - Currency representation validation
   - Address and phone number format checking

## Testing Requirements
- **Key Functionalities That Must Be Verified**:
  - Accuracy of internationalization validation for string externalization
  - Effectiveness of pseudo-localization in identifying layout issues
  - Thoroughness of cultural appropriateness checking
  - Robustness of right-to-left language support
  - Correctness of regional format handling across locales

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - Localization manager verifying that all UI text can be translated
  - Identifying potential layout issues before sending content for translation
  - Validating cultural appropriateness of product elements for specific markets
  - Testing application behavior with right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew
  - Verifying correct formatting of dates, numbers, and currencies across regions

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Internationalization validation must achieve 99%+ accuracy in detecting externalization issues
  - Pseudo-localization must identify 95%+ of potential layout problems
  - Cultural appropriateness checking must validate against 50+ region-specific criteria
  - RTL testing must verify 100% of bidirectional text handling requirements
  - Format validation must test all locale-specific formats with 99%+ accuracy

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling dynamically generated text that requires translation
  - Testing applications with mixed language content on the same screen
  - Appropriate behavior with languages requiring special rendering (Thai, Indic scripts)
  - Correct operation with extremely long translated strings
  - Proper testing of locale-sensitive operations like sorting and filtering

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Internationalization validation: 100% coverage
  - Pseudo-localization engine: 95% coverage
  - Cultural appropriateness analyzer: 90% coverage
  - Bidirectional text testing: 100% coverage
  - Locale-specific format validator: 95% coverage
  - Overall framework code coverage minimum: 95%

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The framework can reliably identify all text that hasn't been properly externalized for translation
2. Pseudo-localization effectively reveals potential layout and display issues pre-translation
3. Cultural appropriateness can be verified for various target markets
4. Right-to-left language support is thoroughly validated for proper bidirectional handling
5. Regional formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies is correctly verified across locales

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up your development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file MUST be generated and included as it is a critical requirement for project completion and verification.
