A specialized test automation framework designed for Quality Assurance Specialists in enterprise environments with strict compliance requirements. This framework emphasizes comprehensive test coverage, detailed reporting, requirement traceability, and regulatory compliance to ensure software quality while meeting industry standards and audit requirements.

## Persona Description
Priya manages the testing strategy for a large financial application with strict compliance requirements. She needs comprehensive test coverage with detailed reporting and traceability to regulatory requirements.

## Key Requirements
1. **Requirement-to-test mapping maintaining traceability between business requirements and test cases**
   - Essential for demonstrating to auditors that all business and regulatory requirements have corresponding verification tests
   - Enables impact analysis when requirements change to identify affected test cases
   - Provides a clear audit trail for compliance verification processes

2. **Compliance reporting generating documentation suitable for regulatory audits**
   - Automates the creation of evidence packages needed for regulatory reviews
   - Ensures consistent formatting and comprehensive inclusion of all required test artifacts
   - Reduces manual effort needed to prepare for compliance audits

3. **Sensitive data handling with secure test fixtures that never expose confidential information**
   - Protects the organization from data breaches during testing activities
   - Ensures test data meets the same security standards as production data
   - Facilitates testing with realistic but secure test data that doesn't compromise privacy regulations

4. **Sign-off workflow tracking approval status of test results by stakeholders**
   - Formalizes the verification and validation process required in regulated environments
   - Creates accountability by recording who approved what and when
   - Provides clear status visibility on testing progress and approvals

5. **Risk-based test prioritization focusing testing effort on high-impact functionality**
   - Optimizes testing resources by concentrating efforts on areas with highest compliance or business risk
   - Ensures the most critical functions receive appropriate testing depth
   - Provides defendable rationale for testing strategy decisions during audits

## Technical Requirements
- **Testability Requirements**:
  - Framework must support linking tests to business requirements with bidirectional traceability
  - Tests must generate detailed evidence of execution suitable for audit purposes
  - Framework must maintain a secure chain of custody for all test artifacts
  - Tests must be executable in segregated environments with controlled data access

- **Performance Expectations**:
  - Report generation must complete within 5 minutes even for large test suites (>10,000 tests)
  - Test execution with full audit logging must not impact performance by more than 15%
  - Risk assessment algorithms must process large requirement sets (>1,000 items) in under 30 seconds
  - Authentication and authorization checks must add no more than 500ms overhead

- **Integration Points**:
  - Must integrate with requirement management systems through standardized APIs
  - Must support export to common document formats (PDF, XLSX, HTML) for audit packages
  - Should provide hooks for integration with approval workflow systems
  - Must integrate with secure credential and test data vaults

- **Key Constraints**:
  - All test data must be either anonymized or synthetic, never actual production data
  - Implementation must comply with relevant data protection regulations
  - Framework must maintain detailed audit logs of all testing activities
  - Solution must operate without requiring elevated system privileges

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

- **Critical User Scenarios**:
  - QA specialist linking tests to regulatory requirements and verifying coverage
  - Generating audit-ready documentation for compliance review
  - Securely managing sensitive test data across test environments
  - Managing the approval workflow for test results from multiple stakeholders
  - Prioritizing test execution based on risk assessment

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Traceability queries must resolve in < 2 seconds for systems with 5,000+ requirements
  - Report generation must complete in < 5 minutes for comprehensive compliance packages
  - Risk assessment calculations must complete in < 30 seconds for large feature sets
  - Approval workflow transactions must complete in < 3 seconds

- **Edge Cases and Error Conditions**:
  - Handling conflicting requirement versions during test mapping
  - Recovery from interrupted report generation with large data sets
  - Appropriate error handling when sensitive data protections are at risk
  - Contingency processes when required approvers are unavailable
  - Fault tolerance for inconsistent risk assessment inputs

- **Required Test Coverage Metrics**:
  - Traceability and requirement mapping: 100% coverage
  - Compliance reporting engine: 100% coverage
  - Security features and data protection: 100% coverage
  - Approval workflow and signing: 95% coverage
  - Risk assessment algorithms: 90% coverage
  - Overall framework code coverage minimum: 95%

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All test cases can be bidirectionally linked to business requirements with full traceability
2. The framework automatically generates compliance reports suitable for regulatory audits
3. Test data is securely managed with no exposure of sensitive information
4. A complete approval workflow tracks and records stakeholder sign-offs
5. Test execution is optimized based on risk prioritization

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Setup Instructions
To set up your development environment:

1. Use `uv venv` to create a virtual environment within the project directory
2. Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the project with `uv pip install -e .`

CRITICAL: Running tests with pytest-json-report and providing the pytest_results.json file is MANDATORY:
```
pip install pytest-json-report
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

The pytest_results.json file MUST be generated and included as it is a critical requirement for project completion and verification.
