# Accessible Text Editor for Vision-Impaired Developers

A specialized text editor library designed for vision-impaired developers with robust accessibility features and screen reader optimization.

## Overview

This project implements a text editor library specifically designed for vision-impaired developers who need excellent accessibility features. It provides screen reader optimization, audio feedback for operations, semantic document navigation, customizable high-contrast themes, and a fully keyboard-driven workflow.

## Persona Description

Dr. Chen has limited vision and uses screen readers and other assistive technologies. She needs a text editor with excellent accessibility that works well with screen readers while still providing powerful editing capabilities.

## Key Requirements

1. **Screen Reader Optimization**: Implement context-aware announcements that clearly convey document structure and content. This is critical for Dr. Chen to understand the hierarchical organization of code (functions, classes, loops, conditionals) and navigate efficiently through complex programming documents without relying on visual cues.

2. **Audio Feedback for Operations**: Develop distinct audio indicators for different editing actions and events. This provides Dr. Chen with immediate non-visual confirmation of operations such as saving, deleting, searching, and syntax errors, reducing dependency on screen reader announcements for operational feedback.

3. **Semantic Document Navigation**: Create a navigation system based on code structure and semantic elements rather than visual layout. This allows Dr. Chen to move efficiently between logical components of code (functions, classes, blocks) instead of navigating line-by-line, significantly improving her programming efficiency.

4. **Customizable High-Contrast Themes**: Implement theming capabilities with adjustable font characteristics and high-contrast color schemes. This accommodates Dr. Chen's limited vision by allowing her to customize the presentation of text to best suit her specific visual needs when she occasionally references the visual layout.

5. **Keyboard-Only Workflow**: Design a comprehensive system of keyboard shortcuts and commands that eliminate any need for mouse interaction. This ensures Dr. Chen can perform all editing operations efficiently without requiring precise mouse positioning, which is challenging with limited vision.

## Technical Requirements

### Testability Requirements
- Screen reader integration must be testable through programmatic verification of announcements
- Audio feedback must be testable through event emission rather than actual sound production
- Semantic navigation structures must be verifiable through tree representation
- Theme customization must be testable through programmatic theme application
- Keyboard command coverage must be verifiable through operation mapping

### Performance Expectations
- Screen reader announcements must be generated within 20ms of state changes
- Audio feedback events must be dispatched within 5ms of operations
- Semantic navigation must generate document structure analysis in under 200ms for files up to 10MB
- Theme application should not impact editing performance
- Keyboard commands must be processed with less than 10ms latency

### Integration Points
- Screen reader API compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Audio feedback event emission for assistive technology integration
- Semantic analysis of code structure
- Theme customization system
- Keyboard command mapping framework

### Key Constraints
- No UI/UX components; all functionality should be implemented as library code
- All features must be fully accessible without visual feedback
- Navigation must work without requiring knowledge of visual layout
- All operations must be possible through keyboard alone
- Compatible with Python 3.8+ ecosystem

IMPORTANT: The implementation should have NO UI/UX components. All functionality must be implemented as testable Python modules and classes that can be thoroughly tested using pytest. Focus on creating well-defined APIs and interfaces rather than user interfaces.

## Core Functionality

The library should implement a text editor core with the following functionality:

1. A screen reader integration system that:
   - Generates rich, context-aware announcements of document structure
   - Provides relevant information about the current editing context
   - Announces changes and updates as they occur
   - Allows customization of announcement verbosity and content

2. An audio feedback system that:
   - Emits distinct events for different editing operations
   - Provides immediate non-visual confirmation of actions
   - Indicates errors, warnings, and state changes
   - Allows customization of event types and significance

3. A semantic navigation system that:
   - Analyzes document structure based on code semantics
   - Provides efficient movement between logical document elements
   - Supports hierarchical navigation of nested structures
   - Maintains context awareness during navigation

4. A theming system that:
   - Supports high-contrast color schemes
   - Allows customization of font characteristics
   - Provides preset accessibility-focused themes
   - Enables fine-grained adjustment of visual presentation

5. A keyboard command system that:
   - Provides comprehensive keyboard access to all features
   - Supports customizable key bindings
   - Implements efficient command sequences for common operations
   - Eliminates dependency on mouse interaction

## Testing Requirements

### Key Functionalities to Verify
- Screen reader announcements correctly represent document structure and changes
- Audio feedback events are properly emitted for all operations
- Semantic navigation accurately identifies and navigates document structure
- Theme customization properly applies accessibility-focused visual adjustments
- Keyboard commands successfully execute all editor operations

### Critical User Scenarios
- Navigating through a complex code file using semantic structure
- Editing code with continuous screen reader feedback
- Receiving audio confirmation for operations like save, delete, and search
- Customizing theme settings for specific visual needs
- Performing complex editing operations using only keyboard commands

### Performance Benchmarks
- Screen reader announcement generation must process at least 1000 lines per second
- Audio event emission must handle at least 50 events per second
- Semantic structure analysis must complete within 100ms for 1000-line documents
- Theme application must not add more than 5ms overhead to rendering operations
- Keyboard command processing must support at least 10 commands per second

### Edge Cases and Error Conditions
- Handling malformed or syntactically incorrect code documents
- Managing extremely large files without overwhelming the screen reader
- Dealing with complex nested structures in semantic navigation
- Supporting users with varying degrees of visual impairment
- Recovering from keyboard command conflicts or errors

### Required Test Coverage Metrics
- Minimum 95% code coverage across all accessibility-related modules
- 100% coverage of screen reader announcement generation
- Complete coverage of all public API methods
- All keyboard commands must have verification tests
- All semantic navigation operations must have test coverage

IMPORTANT:
- ALL functionality must be testable via pytest without any manual intervention
- Tests should verify behavior against requirements, not implementation details
- Tests should be designed to validate the WHAT (requirements) not the HOW (implementation)
- Tests should be comprehensive enough to verify all aspects of the requirements
- Tests should not assume or dictate specific implementation approaches
- REQUIRED: Tests must be run with pytest-json-report to generate a pytest_results.json file:
  ```
  pip install pytest-json-report
  pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
  ```
- The pytest_results.json file must be included as proof that all tests pass

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. Screen reader integration provides clear, context-aware announcements of document structure and content
2. Audio feedback system delivers distinct, immediate confirmation of editing operations
3. Semantic navigation enables efficient movement through code based on logical structure
4. Theme customization supports effective visual adjustments for users with limited vision
5. Keyboard command system provides complete access to all editing functionality without requiring mouse interaction

REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS:
- All tests must pass when run with pytest
- A valid pytest_results.json file must be generated showing all tests passing
- The implementation must satisfy all key requirements specified for this persona

## Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. CRITICAL: For running tests and generating the required json report:
   ```
   pip install pytest-json-report
   pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```

REMINDER: Generating and providing pytest_results.json is a critical requirement for project completion.
