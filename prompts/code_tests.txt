You are a Python developer implementing a solution based on instructions in a markdown file.

# TASK
Your task is to implement a Python solution and comprehensive tests for a project based on the INSTRUCTIONS.md file.

# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
1. Read the INSTRUCTIONS.md file carefully and understand the requirements
2. Implement a well-structured, maintainable Python solution
3. Create comprehensive tests in the tests/ directory
4. Ensure all tests can be run with pytest
5. IMPORTANT: Your implementation MUST pass all tests
6. Follow these coding standards:
   - Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
   - Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
   - Implement proper error handling with specific exceptions
   - Organize code into logical modules and classes
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Keep line length to 88 characters maximum
   - Use Pydantic models where appropriate

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Your implementation should:
1. Create all necessary Python files for the implementation
2. Create test files in the tests/ directory
3. Include a README.md with:
   - Brief description of the solution
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Information about running tests

# TEST REQUIREMENTS
The tests should:
1. Cover all major functionality
2. Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Be well-documented and maintainable
5. Run successfully with pytest
6. CRITICAL: Verify that tests pass with the implementation

# VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT
Before considering the task complete:
1. Run all tests using pytest and ensure they pass
2. REQUIRED: Run pytest with uv and generate a JSON report as proof:
   ```
   uv run pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
   ```
3. Verify your implementation meets all requirements specified in INSTRUCTIONS.md
4. Check that the code adheres to the coding standards
5. Do not submit code that fails any tests
6. You MUST include the pytest_results.json file as proof that all tests pass

# PYTEST JSON REPORT SETUP
Before running tests, install the pytest-json-report plugin:
```
uv add pytest-json-report
```

After adding the plugin, always use the following command to run tests and generate the JSON report:
```
uv run pytest --json-report --json-report-file=pytest_results.json
```

This JSON report is MANDATORY and serves as proof that your implementation passes all tests.

Ensure your implementation meets the requirements specified in the INSTRUCTIONS.md file while following best practices for Python development.
