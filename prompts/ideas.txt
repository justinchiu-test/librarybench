Generate ideas for Python repositories that demonstrate strong programming skills while primarily using Python's standard library
(avoiding external dependencies). Each project should be substantial yet manageable, approximately 1000-2000 lines of code, with a
strong emphasis on testability. For each idea:

1. Describe the identity of the person requesting this project in 2 sentences
2. Provide a clear project title
3. Describe the core functionality and purpose in 2-3 sentences
4. List 3-5 key features that would make this project interesting and useful
5. Explain how the project can be implemented using primarily Python's standard library modules
6. Identify who might benefit from using this project
7. Note any particular programming concepts or patterns it would showcase
8. Include 10 possible extensions or variations that could be added to the base project

Focus on projects that:
- Solve a real problem or fulfill a practical need
- Demonstrate intermediate to advanced Python skills
- Can be built entirely or primarily with Python's standard library
- Showcase creative uses of built-in modules (e.g., re, json, csv, asyncio, etc.)
- Could be reasonably completed by an individual developer
- Would be presentable in a portfolio and highlight algorithmic thinking
- Require minimal to no external dependencies for core functionality

Please provide 10 diverse project ideas spanning different domains (e.g., command-line tools, file systems, workflow management,
text editors, in-memory databases) that can be accomplished with the standard library.

Output these ideas in `ideas/{project_name}.txt`
