# The Task

I am a Cloud Site Reliability Engineer managing microservices configurations across multi-region clusters. I need to interpolate secrets from vaults, merge service defaults with per-env overrides, validate everything against strict schemas, and produce clear change logs for audit. This code repository consolidates these capabilities in one Python module.

# The Requirements

* `ensure_thread_safety` : Permit parallel health-check routines and rollout scripts to read the shared config concurrently.  
* `interpolate` : Dynamically fetch `${VAULT:db_password}` or `${ENV:AWS_REGION}` at runtime.  
* `generate_docs` : Output HTML/Markdown runbooks and config reference docs for the SRE handbook.  
* `diff` : Produce a diff between canary and prod configs, highlighting any drift.  
* `on_load` / `on_access` : Enforce liveness probe settings to never be empty or out of spec when accessed.  
* `validate_schema` : Schema-validate service ports, replica counts, and security settings.  
* `get_int`, `get_str`, `get_bool` : Safely pull typed values to configure watchers and alarms.  
* `register_validator` : Add custom security checks (e.g., no open 0.0.0.0 ports).  
* `merge_configs` : Merge Helm chart defaults, secrets manager overrides, and manual patches with defined precedence.  
* `section` : Support nested sections like `service.api`, `service.worker`, `logging.levels`.
