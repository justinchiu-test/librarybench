# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer responsible for rolling out configuration changes across hundreds of servers. I want to be able to author, merge, validate, and document my YAML/JSON configs in a reproducible, thread-safe way whenever our CI/CD pipelines spin up new nodes. This code repository gives me a unified API to load, merge, check, compare, and even auto-document every config change at deploy time.

# The Requirements

* `ensure_thread_safety` : Guarantee safe concurrent reads (and optional writes) to the in-memory config object from multiple pipeline threads.  
* `interpolate` : Support `${ENV:HOME}`, `${DEPLOY_ENV}`, or `${VAR}` placeholders in any string value and resolve them at runtime.  
* `generate_docs` : Auto-generate Markdown or HTML documentation from the config schema, inline comments, and examples for our ops wiki.  
* `diff` : Compute and display a human-readable diff between two config versions (e.g., staging vs. production).  
* `on_load` / `on_access` : Attach validation hooks to specific fields (for instance, enforce no empty `server_list` after load).  
* `validate_schema` : Define required fields, types, ranges (e.g., `port` must be 1â€“65535), and ensure merged configs pass this schema.  
* `get_int`, `get_str`, `get_bool` : Typed getters that cast or check and return native Python types straight out of the config.  
* `register_validator` : Add custom validators (e.g., regex-based hostnames or CIDR checks) at field or section granularity.  
* `merge_configs` : Layer defaults, file-based settings, CLI arguments, and environment variables with exact precedence you control.  
* `section` : Use hierarchical sections like `database.primary`, `database.replicas.read`, or `cache.redis.cluster` and fetch them cleanly.
