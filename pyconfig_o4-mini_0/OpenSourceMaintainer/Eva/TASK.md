# The Task

I am an open-source library maintainer providing a robust configuration system for downstream users. I want to ensure they can interpolate environment vars, merge defaults, validate against a schema, inspect diffs, attach custom checks, and even auto-generate docs for their projects. This code repository is the backbone of my new config library, complete with typed getters, thread safety, and nested sections.

# The Requirements

* `ensure_thread_safety` : Make sure library users can safely read configs from multiple threads in web apps or workers.  
* `interpolate` : Let users embed `${HOME}`, `${ENV:CONFIG_DIR}` or custom vars in their config files.  
* `generate_docs` : Provide a CLI command to generate Markdown/HTML docs from the user’s config schema and comments.  
* `diff` : Enable users to diff versions of their settings during incremental upgrades.  
* `on_load` / `on_access` : Offer hooks so they can run custom code when any config key is loaded or accessed.  
* `validate_schema` : Provide schema definitions (types, required, ranges) and reject invalid configs.  
* `get_int`, `get_str`, `get_bool` : Typed accessors so users don’t have to cast manually.  
* `register_validator` : A registry for user-defined checks (regex, range or arbitrary callables).  
* `merge_configs` : High-level API to merge defaults, file settings, environment vars, and programmatic overrides.  
* `section` : Support nested namespaced sections like `logging.handlers.file` or `auth.oauth.providers`.
