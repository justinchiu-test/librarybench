# The Task

I am a cloud infrastructure engineer managing dozens of microservices across multiple environments. I want to be able to centrally define and validate my services’ configuration, merge overrides in a predictable way, fetch and rotate secrets on demand, and get clear error messages when anything goes wrong. This code repository helps me load, merge, validate, document, and secure all my service configs.

# The Requirements

* `secret_manager_integration` : Fetch or rotate database passwords and API tokens from AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault when loading configs.
* `json_schema_support` : Export and validate my service config definitions against JSON Schema so that CI can catch mistakes early.
* `deprecation_warnings` : Mark old config keys as deprecated and emit warnings so my team knows when to update services.
* `config_merger` : Merge defaults, environment-specific YAML/JSON files, and environment variables with fine-grained precedence.
* `interactive_cli` : Prompt me interactively for any missing production-critical settings during deployments.
* `list_merge_strategies` : Choose between append, replace, or unique-merge strategies when merging endpoint lists.
* `documentation_gen` : Auto-generate Markdown docs for each service’s config schema and publish to our internal site.
* `custom_format_loaders` : Add support for TOML and XML config sources from legacy services.
* `secret_decryption` : Detect and decrypt AES-encrypted or base64-wrapped secrets seamlessly during load.
* `error_reporting` : Provide rich errors with file names, line numbers, and context snippets to debug misconfigurations quickly.
