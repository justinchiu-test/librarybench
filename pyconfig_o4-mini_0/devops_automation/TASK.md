# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer automating CI/CD pipelines for diverse software stacks. I need a flexible configuration library that merges settings from code repos, environment variables, and secret stores, validates them, and integrates seamlessly into automation scripts. This code repository is my go-to toolkit for robust, secure, and self-documenting config management.

# The Requirements

* `secret_manager_integration` : Pull and rotate build and deployment credentials from HashiCorp Vault in pipeline jobs.
* `json_schema_support` : Validate pipeline config files against JSON Schema to catch misconfigurations before deploy.
* `deprecation_warnings` : Notify when legacy pipeline options are used so I can refactor jobs gradually.
* `config_merger` : Merge default pipeline settings, repo-based configs, and CI/CD environment variables with precise control.
* `interactive_cli` : Ask operators for missing parameters (e.g., deployment region) when running scripts manually.
* `list_merge_strategies` : Manage lists of deployment targets using append, replace, or custom strategies.
* `documentation_gen` : Generate Markdown and HTML docs for our pipeline config reference automatically.
* `custom_format_loaders` : Register YAML, TOML, or REST-API-based loaders for third-party tool settings.
* `secret_decryption` : Decrypt AES-wrapped tokens or base64-encrypted secrets for tool integrations.
* `error_reporting` : Provide file path, line number, and context in error messages so automation failures are easy to debug.
