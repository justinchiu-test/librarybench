# The Task

I am a security officer responsible for enforcing configuration best practices and secrets handling across the organization. I need a configuration framework that integrates with our external vaults, warns on deprecated or insecure keys, and generates compliance documentation. This code repository ensures our configs are secure, auditable, and maintainable.

# The Requirements

* `secret_manager_integration` : Seamlessly fetch, cache, and rotate secrets from our enterprise HashiCorp Vault and AWS KMS.
* `json_schema_support` : Export strict JSON Schemas that enforce security constraints on all config values.
* `deprecation_warnings` : Flag deprecated or insecure settings (e.g., weak ciphers) and alert engineers when they are accessed.
* `config_merger` : Apply precise precedence for defaults, vault-derived overrides, and environment-specific overrides.
* `interactive_cli` : Prompt security-related confirmations for risky settings before applying them.
* `list_merge_strategies` : Enforce unique-merge on IP allowlists or completely replace them for lockdown scenarios.
* `documentation_gen` : Auto-produce compliance-ready Markdown docs with schema definitions and comments.
* `custom_format_loaders` : Register parsers for signed XML policy files or bespoke config endpoints.
* `secret_decryption` : Detect and decrypt AES-encrypted blobs or base64-encoded secrets following our encryption-at-rest policy.
* `error_reporting` : Deliver detailed error reports with context, file, and line info so auditors can trace issues.
