# The Task

I am a data engineer in a fast-moving analytics team. I want to orchestrate ETL pipelines that reliably extract, transform, and load terabytes of data on schedule, handle ad-hoc jobs, and gracefully recover from failures. This code repository gives me a powerful Python scheduler with hooks, dependencies, and dynamic control so I can build production-grade workflows.

# The Requirements

* `register_pre_post_hooks`          : Provide pre-execution and post-execution hooks to prepare staging tables, set up connections, and clean up temp files.
* `cron_expression_support`         : Schedule daily, hourly, and complex five- or six-field cron jobs for incremental loads and snapshot exports.
* `declare_task_dependencies`       : Chain extraction, transformation, and load steps in a DAG so downstream tasks run only after upstream success.
* `set_task_priority`               : Prioritize critical daily loads over lower-priority analytics jobs when compute resources are limited.
* `control_task_runtime`            : Start, pause, resume, or cancel tasks or entire pipelines on demand via API or CLI.
* `dynamic_reschedule`              : Adjust interval or cron expressions at runtime to accommodate late-arriving data or expedite urgent backfills.
* `documentation_examples`          : Reference quickstart guides and example ETL pipelines for AWS S3, Redshift, and BigQuery.
* `one_off_tasks`                   : Define single-run jobs for on-demand schema migrations or manual replay of a specific date partition.
* `timezone_awareness`              : Schedule tasks in the relevant data centerâ€™s time zone or convert schedules to UTC without second-guessing offsets.
* `thread_safe_scheduler`           : Safely register, cancel, and inspect hundreds of concurrent jobs from multiple threads and processes.
