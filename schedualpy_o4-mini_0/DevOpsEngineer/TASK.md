# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer managing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure maintenance. I want to automate backups, deploys, and health checks on precise schedules, react to infrastructure events, and pause or cancel tasks during incident response. This code repository provides a robust scheduler with fine-grained control and dynamic reconfiguration.

# The Requirements

* `register_pre_post_hooks`          : Inject logic before and after deploymentsâ€”for example, drain load balancers, perform canary tests, and send notifications.
* `cron_expression_support`         : Define cron jobs for nightly backups, weekly patching, and hourly health checks.
* `declare_task_dependencies`       : Ensure backups complete before starting configuration drift audits or rolling updates.
* `set_task_priority`               : Elevate urgent security patches above routine maintenance when system resources are under heavy load.
* `control_task_runtime`            : Start, pause, resume, or cancel deployments or health checks during active incidents or manual overrides.
* `dynamic_reschedule`              : Change patch window or backup frequency on the fly based on incidents or on-call feedback.
* `documentation_examples`          : Follow step-by-step examples for Kubernetes rolling updates, Docker image sweeps, and cloud provider snapshots.
* `one_off_tasks`                   : Run one-time tasks like emergency key rotations or on-demand log archive retrieval.
* `timezone_awareness`              : Schedule global maintenance in local data-center time zones or translate to UTC for a single-pane schedule view.
* `thread_safe_scheduler`           : Handle concurrent registration and cancellation of hundreds of monitoring and provisioning tasks across multiple control threads.
