# The Task

I am a marketing manager running multi-channel campaigns. I want to trigger email blasts, social-media posts, and ad updates at the right moment worldwide, monitor success, and pause or reprioritize on the fly. This code repository delivers an intuitive scheduler with cron, hooks, and real-time controls.

# The Requirements

* `register_pre_post_hooks`          : Add context setup (dynamic A/B test parameters) before each campaign and cleanup (report aggregation) after completion.
* `cron_expression_support`         : Schedule global email sends, Twitter posts, and ad bid adjustments using five- or six-field cron expressions.
* `declare_task_dependencies`       : Sequence tasks so that audience segmentation completes before send operations, and reports run after sends.
* `set_task_priority`               : Prioritize time-sensitive product launch emails over routine newsletters when system resources are limited.
* `control_task_runtime`            : Start, pause, resume, or cancel campaigns or channel groups instantly from our dashboard.
* `dynamic_reschedule`              : Change send windows or retargeting schedules on demand via API based on real-time analytics.
* `documentation_examples`          : Follow ready-made examples for Mailchimp, Facebook Ads API, and LinkedIn campaign scheduling.
* `one_off_tasks`                   : Run single-send tasks for urgent announcements or one-time VIP offers.
* `timezone_awareness`              : Target audiences in their local time zones or convert all schedules to UTC for global oversight.
* `thread_safe_scheduler`           : Coordinate hundreds of concurrent sends, posts, and bid updates without race conditions.
