# The Task

I am an IoT developer managing thousands of devices worldwide. I want to push firmware updates and collect telemetry at local times for each region, dynamically adjust schedules when a network segment goes down, and trigger emergency one-off tasks if a critical alert fires. This code repository provides timezone-safe scheduling, drift correction to avoid device storms, clustering-safe hooks for preparing device contexts, and a REST API so my management console can orchestrate updates in real time.

# The Requirements

* `enable_daylight_saving_support` : Automatically adjust telemetry collection times for devices in DST-observing regions.
* `dynamic_reschedule` : Change cron expressions or intervals on the fly when a gateway or network segment experiences issues.
* `schedule_one_off_task` : Dispatch one-time emergency update or diagnostic tasks by specifying an exact UTC timestamp or delay.
* `register_pre_post_hooks` : Setup ephemeral TLS certificates before job execution and revoke them afterwards.
* `apply_jitter_and_drift_correction` : Add random jitter across devices to prevent simultaneous check-ins and correct any drift.
* `load_plugin` : Implement custom transports to push payloads over MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP based on device capabilities.
* `create_task_group` : Cluster devices into groups like “north-america-sensors” or “asia-actuators” for bulk operations.
* `ThreadSafeScheduler` : Safely register, cancel, or reschedule tasks from multiple threads in our update orchestrator.
* `emit_metrics` : Send counters and histograms on task dispatch latency and success rates to our Prometheus gateway.
* `RESTfulManagementAPI` : Provide endpoints for our IoT console to list, modify, or cancel scheduled device jobs.
