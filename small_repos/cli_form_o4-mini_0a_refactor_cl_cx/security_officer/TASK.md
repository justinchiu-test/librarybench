# The Task

I am a security officer. I want to collect incident reports securely over SSH sessions with real-time validation, full audit trails, and strict formatting. This code repository lets me build a hardened, accessible incident form for field agents.

# The Requirements

* `validate_input` : Real-Time Validation Feedback to catch malformed incident IDs, IP addresses, or unauthorized characters  
* `curses_renderer` : Curses-Based Renderer offering locked-down, full-screen capture with navigation hints  
* `text_field`    : Text Field Type enforcing regex for CVE patterns, max lengths for descriptions, and sensitive-data masking  
* `wizard_layout` : Multi-Page Wizard Layouts grouping fields into “Incident Details → Impact Assessment → Mitigation → Submit”  
* `format_error`  : Customizable Error Formatting with red/high-visibility alerts for critical omissions  
* `date_time_picker` : Date & Time Picker Field Type to timestamp events precisely, with timezone normalization  
* `enable_accessibility_mode` : Accessibility Mode ensuring all agents, including those with visual impairments, can file reports  
* `audit_log`     : Audit Logging & Change History capturing every keystroke, validation failure, and page jump for compliance  
* `register_field_plugin` : Plugin API for Custom Fields to integrate a file browser for attaching logs or pcap captures  
* `export_data`   : Data Export Utilities to seal and encrypt the final report as JSON or YAML for secure transmission
