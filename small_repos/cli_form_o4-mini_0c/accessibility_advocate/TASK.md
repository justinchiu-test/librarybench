# The Task

I am an accessibility advocate ensuring CLI tools are inclusive for all users, including the visually impaired. I want a highly configurable form engine that supports screen readers, keyboard‐only operation, high‐contrast modes, and ARIA announcements—all while retaining full validation, branching, and logging. This code repository is my go‐to for building accessible terminal wizards.

# The Requirements

* `real_time_validate()`  : Provide immediate feedback that can be vocalized by screen readers.  
* `apply_skip_logic()`    : Dynamically hide irrelevant fields so users don’t tab through empty inputs.  
* `navigate()`            : Robust keyboard shortcuts, history navigation, jump to section, and boundary guards.  
* `enable_accessibility_mode()` : Toggle high‐contrast themes, announce field labels and errors in screen‐reader‐friendly format.  
* `init_curses_renderer()`: Render accessible form controls with proper focus indicators in ncurses.  
* `audit_log_event()`     : Log accessibility‐mode activation, focus changes, and validation announcements.  
* `start_wizard()`        : Define clear multi‐page flow with visible progress markers and ARIA‐like cues.  
* `save_session()` / `load_session()` : Allow users to pause and resume without losing context.  
* `register_plugin()`     : Let other devs contribute accessible widgets (e.g., audio cue fields) easily.  
* `branch_flow()`         : Ensure conditional flows respect user preferences for reduced complexity or detail.
