# The Task

I am a seasoned system administrator tasked with provisioning complex server clusters via terminal script. I want to be able to guide junior admins step by step through network, storage, and service configuration—while enforcing validation and capturing an audit trail. This code repository provides a powerful CLI‐form engine that handles dynamic flows, real‐time checks, full curses UIs, and compliance‐grade logging.

# The Requirements

* `real_time_validate()`  : Inline checks that flag invalid IPs, hostnames, and credentials as the user types.  
* `apply_skip_logic()`    : Conditionally skip database settings if “stateless mode” was selected earlier.  
* `navigate()`            : Next/previous, jump‐to‐step shortcuts, navigation history, and bounds checking.  
* `enable_accessibility_mode()` : High‐contrast color themes and screen‐reader announcements for remote terminal sessions.  
* `init_curses_renderer()`: Full‐screen ncurses UI with windows, labels, input boxes, and status bars.  
* `audit_log_event()`     : Timestamped logs for every field edit, validation failure, and navigation action.  
* `start_wizard()`        : Multi‐page layout with progress indicator (Network → Storage → Services → Review).  
* `save_session()` / `load_session()` : Checkpoint your configuration to disk or central DB, resume later.  
* `register_plugin()`     : Hook in a custom field type for selecting pre‐built VM images from our private catalog.  
* `branch_flow()`         : Reorder sections on the fly if a “quick‐deploy” flag is set or external inventory service returns special status.
