# The Task

I am a Translator and Localization Manager ensuring our CLI tools speak every user’s language. I want a framework to extract, test, and validate translations, profile text outputs, cache translation lookups, and run end‐to‐end tests. This code repository standardizes i18n workflows while giving me profiling, caching, logging, secrets (for translation APIs), retry logic, DI, input validation, and styled prompts.

# The Requirements

* `profile_command` : Measure and compare translation pipeline timings (extraction, compile .po files, runtime lookups) and generate performance reports.  
* `DependencyInjector` : Wire in translation API clients (DeepL, Google Translate), file‐parsers, and database connectors via DI at runtime.  
* `cache` : In‐memory or disk caching of translation API responses, glossary lookups, and pluralization rules.  
* `i18n` : Comprehensive externalization of all help strings, error messages, and prompts to `.po/.mo` for translators.  
* `run_test` : Automated tests to invoke translated CLI commands, simulate locale settings, capture outputs, and assert correct language.  
* `validate_input` : Check for missing translation keys, invalid placeholders, regex patterns, and file‐exists for locale bundles.  
* `get_secret` : Securely store and fetch API credentials for translation services from OS keyrings, AWS KMS, or GPG‐encrypted files.  
* `setup_logging` : Structured logs of extraction and compile steps, in JSON or human‐readable formats, with level filters.  
* `retry` : Decorate translation API calls with exponential backoff and jitter to handle rate limits and transient network errors.  
* `prompt_style` : Color‐coded prompts for review steps, translation approvals, and CLI proofing sessions with rich styling.
