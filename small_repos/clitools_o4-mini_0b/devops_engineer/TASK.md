# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer responsible for CI/CD pipelines across multiple microservices. I want to be able to tag, package, configure and deploy our internal tooling with minimal ceremony. This code repository provides a one-stop CLI framework that automates release bumping, configuration, secrets management and robust retries so I can focus on shipping code, not boilerplate.

# The Requirements

* `bump_version` : Auto-bump the package version based on git tags and generate a new annotated release.
* `init_package` : Scaffold setup.py or pyproject.toml for any new service or internal library.
* `publish_package` : Publish built artifacts to PyPI or our Nexus repository with a single command.
* `register_hook` : Define pre-deploy and post-deploy plugin hooks so teams can inject custom approval gates or notifications.
* `handle_signals` : Catch SIGINT/SIGTERM, run cleanup tasks (tear down ephemeral infra) and show a friendly “Deployment aborted” message.
* `load_config` : Parse .ini, JSON, YAML and TOML config files, merging them into a single unified dict.
* `env_override` : Bind all config keys to environment variables with a customizable “DEVOPS_” prefix for 12-factor flag overrides.
* `compute_default` : Support dynamic defaults (e.g. timestamped bucket names or random job IDs) evaluated at runtime.
* `generate_docs` : Auto-generate Markdown, reStructuredText, HTML and man pages from the CLI spec so docs never drift.
* `validate_input` : Plug in validators for ranges (CPU counts), file‐exists checks (SSH keys) and regex patterns (semantic versions).
* `fetch_secret` : Integrate with AWS KMS and HashiCorp Vault to retrieve API credentials at runtime.
* `retry_call` : Decorate deployment or API calls with exponential backoff, jitter and a max-attempts policy.
