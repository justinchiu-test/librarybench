# The Task

I am a plugin developer who wants to extend an existing CLI framework with custom hooks, log handlers, and config loaders. I want to hook into subcommands, inject my own flags, provide supplemental config formats, and register telemetry collectors—all without forking the core. This code repository exposes plugin hook points, a parsed config API, prompt styling, signal cleanup, telemetry stubs, alias registration, caching utilities, built-in flags, and auto-parser generation so I can drop in features seamlessly.

# The Requirements

* `register_subcommands`   : Discover and group my plugin’s commands under existing namespaces with inherited flags  
* `parse_config`           : Extend config loader to support my custom YAML tags or TOML tables with schema merging  
* `configure_prompt`       : Offer my own prompt_theme presets for rich colors/layouts  
* `install_signal_handlers`: Tie into global SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanup to run plugin teardown logic  
* `register_plugin_hooks`  : Expose pre_execute and post_execute hook registrations for commands and log handlers  
* `collect_telemetry`      : Attach custom telemetry collectors to record plugin-specific usage events (opt-in)  
* `register_aliases`       : Add my own aliases or abbreviations to core commands without conflicts  
* `cache_helper`           : Use provided caching decorators/context managers to speed up repeated API calls  
* `inject_common_flags`    : Leverage the framework’s auto-injected --help, --version, --verbose/-v, --quiet  
* `autobuild_parser`       : Define plugin flags declaratively and have them auto-added to argparse with types, choices, help
