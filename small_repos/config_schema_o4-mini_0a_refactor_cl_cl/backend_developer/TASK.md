# The Task

I am a backend developer working on a Python microservice framework. I want to be able to declare my serviceâ€™s settings in JSON, INI or YAML, pull those settings into my classes and functions automatically, validate them at load time, enrich them with environment variables, and expose a live API for changing configuration on the fly. This code repository gives me decorators, loaders, validators, caching, and export tools so I can focus on business logic, not config plumbing.

# The Requirements

* `with_config` : Decorator-based Injection of validated config sections or keys into functions and class methods.
* `load_config` : JSON/INI/YAML Loader that auto-detects file format and parses into a unified Python dict.
* `_cache` : Caching Layer to store parsed and validated configs keyed by filepath and modification timestamp.
* `ValidationError` : Rich Error Reporting including filename, line number, section, key, expected vs. actual type, and suggested fixes.
* `ConfigManager.get` / `ConfigManager.set` : Programmatic Access API to query, update, and serialize configuration at runtime.
* `expand_env_vars` : Environment Variable Expansion for `${VAR}` or `$VAR` placeholders in string values.
* `validate_types` : Type Checking of loaded config values against declared Python or Pydantic types.
* `export_json_schema` : JSON Schema Export of the internal ConfigSchema definitions for external CI/CD validation tools.
* `prompt_missing` : Interactive Prompts on CLI to ask the developer for required but missing values.
* `load_yaml` (optional) : YAML Loader support via PyYAML or ruamel.yaml when a `.yaml` or `.yml` file is detected.
