# The Task

I am a framework maintainer designing a plugin architecture for community-driven extensions. I want to allow contributors to write new config loaders, validators, and transformers without modifying my core code. I also need hot-reloading in development, clear override semantics, and composable schemas for different feature modules. This code repository gives me a solid foundation with plugin discovery, watching, merging, and advanced error diagnostics.

# The Requirements

* `load_yaml` : Optional support for loading YAML configuration files via PyYAML or ruamel.yaml in core and plugins.  
* `watch_config_file` : Detect file changes and auto-reload or hot-swap in development mode so plugin authors see updates instantly.  
* `override_cli_args` : Integrate with argparse or click so core and plugin flags can override any config key.  
* `register_plugin` : A plugin system with discovery hooks to add new file formats, validators, loaders, or post-processing callbacks.  
* `set_default_factory` : Allow default values in core and plugins via factories (e.g., timestamped logs, random IDs).  
* `programmatic_api` : Expose methods to query, update, and serialize configuration at runtime for both core and plugin logic.  
* `report_error` : Produce detailed error diagnostics including filename, line number, section, key, expected vs. actual type, and suggested fixes across all plugins.  
* `merge_configs` : Merge multiple configuration sources (core defaults, plugin defaults, user overrides) in a deterministic override order.  
* `compose_schema` : Compose large configurations from modular sub-schemas contributed by plugins for feature isolation.  
* `load_dotenv` : Load simple `KEY=VALUE` pairs from a `.env` file to support secret-injection in plugin configs.
