# The Task

I am a backend developer building a web application with multiple environments (dev, staging, prod). I want to load settings from YAML or `.env`, override via environment variables or CLI flags in containers, merge shared and service-specific schemas, support dynamic defaults like session keys, and hot-reload in local dev. This code repository offers a unified, extensible config framework with live reload and rich validation.

# The Requirements

* `load_yaml` : Optional support for loading YAML configuration files via PyYAML or ruamel.yaml for service settings.  
* `watch_config_file` : Detect file changes and auto-reload or hot-swap configuration in development servers.  
* `override_cli_args` : Integrate with argparse or click so container entrypoints can override config keys (e.g., `--port=8080`).  
* `register_plugin` : A plugin system to add new file formats, validators (e.g., JSON Schema), or post-processing hooks for custom needs.  
* `set_default_factory` : Allow default values such as random session secrets or build timestamps via callables.  
* `programmatic_api` : Expose methods to query, update, and serialize configuration at runtime for health-checks and admin dashboards.  
* `report_error` : Produce detailed error messages including filename, line number, section, key, expected vs. actual type, and suggested fixes for faster debugging.  
* `merge_configs` : Merge base config, `.env` values, environment variables, and runtime overrides with a clear precedence.  
* `compose_schema` : Compose large application configs from modular sub-schemas (database, cache, auth, logging) for clear separation.  
* `load_dotenv` : Load simple `KEY=VALUE` pairs from a `.env` file into the config namespace for local development and CI pipelines.
