# The Task

I am a Data Scientist building complex ML pipelines that require tuning dozens of parameters across experiments. I want to be able to define, validate, snapshot, and override my hyperparameters and data-source settings in a reproducible way. This code repository streamlines experiment configuration, validation, logging, and dynamic overrides so I can focus on modeling, not boilerplate.

# The Requirements

* `register_plugin`            : Register custom loaders for parameter grids, data manifests, or notification hooks to record experiments.  
* `validate_config`            : Enforce JSON-schema or bespoke schemas to catch invalid hyperparameters before training begins.  
* `export_to_env`              : Export settings as `KEY=VALUE` for reproducible shell-based runs or inject directly into `os.environ`.  
* `log_event`                  : Produce structured logs for parameter loads, merges, schema violations, and experiment reruns.  
* `get_namespace`              : Access nested sections like `model.layers` or `training.optimizer` cleanly in code.  
* `snapshot`                   : Freeze immutable snapshots of experiments for versioning and concurrency in distributed runs.  
* `load_toml_source`           : Blend TOML experiment configs with JSON defaults and env overrides.  
* `diff_changes`               : Compute and log the delta of hyperparameter changes between experiment iterations.  
* `override_config`            : Programmatically tweak individual parameters or entire blocks for hyperparameter sweeps.  
* `parse_cli_args`             : Accept CLI flags like `--learning-rate` or `--batch-size` to override defaults at runtime.
