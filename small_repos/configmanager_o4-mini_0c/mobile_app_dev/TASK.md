# The Task

I am a mobile app developer building cross‐platform releases. I want a single source of truth for API endpoints, feature flags, and build variants. I need to override settings per environment, validate strings and numeric flags, and hot‐reload them during emulator testing. This code repository helps me manage, validate, and audit every config change with minimal boilerplate.

# The Requirements

* `hot_reload()` : Auto‐reload config on file changes during emulator sessions  
* `export_to_json()` : Export the merged mobile config to JSON for automated QA tests  
* `add_validation_hook()` : Attach regex (URLs, keys) and numeric range checks to flags  
* `namespace()` : Group configs under `development`, `staging`, `production`, or feature modules  
* `setup_logging()` : Emit structured logs for load/merge/validation failures to debug console  
* `load_yaml()` : Support YAML files for human‐friendly feature‐flag lists when PyYAML is available  
* `load_envvars()` : Pull CI/CD secrets or API keys from environment with auto‐casting  
* `enable_cache()` : Cache resolved image asset lists or large feature-flag sets  
* `parse_cli_args()` : Let QA engineers override any flag at build time with CLI arguments  
* `lazy_load()` : Only fetch heavy JSON schemas or dynamic flags when first used in code
