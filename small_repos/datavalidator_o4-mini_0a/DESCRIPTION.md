# DataValidator

## Purpose and Motivation
DataValidator is a schema-based validation toolkit for Python structures (dicts, lists, primitives) akin to a lightweight pydantic or cerberus. It lets you define simple schemas and run batch or streaming data checks, enforcing types, ranges, patterns, and custom rules without external dependenciesâ€”ideal for ETL scripts, microservices, and data ingestion.

## Core Functionality
- Define schemas with type assertions (int, str, list, dict) and optional nested structures.
- Support range checks (min/max), regex/string patterns, and length constraints.
- Custom validation functions that can be registered per field or per-schema.
- Aggregated error reporting that pinpoints invalid fields with contextual messages.
- Batch validation interface for lists of records plus single-item validation.
- Schema inheritance or composition to reuse common rules across multiple data shapes.
