# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer overseeing dozens of CI/CD build agents. I want to monitor source repositories and build artifacts directories in real‐time, batching updates and throttling spikes during peak commit times. This code repository helps me plug a robust file‐watching service into our orchestration system.

# The Requirements

* `configure_thread_pool(max_workers)` : Dispatch file‐change handlers concurrently, scaling to hundreds of repositories without resource starvation.
* `set_filters(include=['src/**'], exclude=['.git/', '*.log'])` : Include or exclude patterns so we only watch relevant code and ignore logs or VCS metadata.
* `set_throttle(max_events_per_window, window_ms)` : Throttle bursts of events during massive merges or branch operations.
* `on_event(callback)` : Deliver typed events (created/modified/deleted/moved) with associated path and timestamp.
* `batch_dispatch(batch_interval_ms)` : Buffer and emit event batches at configurable intervals to reduce overhead on our build orchestrator.
* `configure_logging('INFO')` : Hook into Python logging to monitor watcher health and verbosity in CI logs.
* `set_polling_strategy(network_poll)` : Swap in a custom polling strategy optimized for NFS and SMB shares in our cluster.
* `apply_rate_limit('artifact_uploader', 10)` : Rate‐limit the uploader to avoid overwhelming S3 or artifact caches.
* `run_single_scan(repo_path)` : Trigger on‐demand repository scans for manual debugging or drift detection.
* Context Manager API (`with fs_watcher.Watcher(...) as watcher:`) : Simplify lifecycle management in our automation scripts.
