# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer overseeing our microservices fleet. I want to be able to detect configuration drifts and trigger zero-downtime reloads when service code or config files change. This code repository gives me a reliable, extensible file‐watcher framework that plugs into our CI/CD pipelines and monitoring stack.

# The Requirements

* `start_metrics_endpoint` : expose real-time stats (events/sec, handler latencies, queue sizes) over HTTP or callback for my Prometheus exporters  
* `scan_once`              : perform an on-demand crawl of config directories to verify consistency before deployments  
* `register_plugin`        : hook in custom filters (e.g., ignore legacy back­up files) and event sinks (e.g., post to Slack, trigger Ansible)  
* `set_thread_pool_size`   : tune the number of concurrent workers so I don’t overload our servers during bursts of file changes  
* `configure_logging`      : integrate with Python `logging` at debug/info/warning/error levels for my centralized log aggregator  
* `set_handler_timeout`    : automatically cancel or alert on long-running hooks (e.g., slow DB migrations)  
* `set_throttle_rate`      : limit event delivery to handlers under high-churn scenarios (bulk config pushes)  
* `generate_change_summary`: produce daily human-readable reports (“3 .env files updated, 1 removed”) for our operations dashboard  
* `enable_move_detection`  : infer renames of secret keys or certificates to avoid churning alerts  
* `add_ignore_rule`        : filter out editor temporary files and OS hidden files via customizable patterns
