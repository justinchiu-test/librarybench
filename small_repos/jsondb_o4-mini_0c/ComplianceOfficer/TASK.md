# The Task

I am a compliance officer in a financial firm. I want an auditable repository of transaction logs and policy documents: full version history, timed purges for GDPR, an immutable change stream, and secure backups. This code repository gives me a controllable JSON store with all the governance features I need.

# The Requirements

* `trackVersions` : Immutable, tamper-evident history of every transaction and policy change with rollback auditing  
* `setTTL` : Automatically purge aged PII or outdated policies after their retention window closes  
* `streamChanges` : Real-time streaming of all changes into SIEM and audit dashboards  
* `updateDocument` : Apply compliance updates or annotate records with merge semantics at the field level  
* `backupRestore` : Scheduled snapshots and incremental backups with an easy restore process for audits  
* `controlConcurrency` : Pessimistic locking to prevent concurrent updates during sensitive policy revisions  
* `encryptAtRest` : AES-256 encryption of logs and documents to meet regulatory data-at-rest requirements  
* `batchUpsert` : Group hundreds of transaction records into a single atomic audit insert  
* `registerPlugin` : Integrate custom alerting plugins for policy breaches or suspicious update patterns  
* `setStorageBackend` : Choose between on-prem file storage, encrypted object storage, or an HSM-backed backend
