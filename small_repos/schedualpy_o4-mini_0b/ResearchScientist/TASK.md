# The Task

I am a research scientist running computational experiments and data analysis pipelines. I want to schedule simulations, post-processing, and result validations with complex timing, manage dependencies, and adjust on the fly as new data arrives. This code repository offers a flexible scheduler with hooks, DAG support, and runtime controls.

# The Requirements

* `register_pre_post_hooks`          : Initialize simulation environments and clean up temporary artifacts after completion.
* `cron_expression_support`         : Schedule long-running experiments with cron expressions or custom intervals for periodic data snapshots.
* `declare_task_dependencies`       : Define DAGs so that data preprocessing runs before model training and validation only after training succeeds.
* `set_task_priority`               : Prioritize urgent proof-of-concept runs over routine benchmarks when compute nodes are scarce.
* `control_task_runtime`            : Start, pause, resume, or cancel entire experiment suites or individual phases in real time.
* `dynamic_reschedule`              : Adapt experiment schedules on-the-fly when new parameter sets or input data become available.
* `documentation_examples`          : Consult tutorials for HPC cluster integration, GPU-accelerated workflows, and cloud-based batch jobs.
* `one_off_tasks`                   : Schedule single-run statistical analyses or ad-hoc data visualizations at specified datetimes.
* `timezone_awareness`              : Coordinate multi-site experiments in different time zones or normalize timestamps to UTC for consistency.
* `thread_safe_scheduler`           : Safely handle concurrent experiment launches, metric collectors, and notification tasks across multiple threads.
