# The Task

I am an IoT architect building a fleet management system. I want to schedule sensor polling, firmware updates, and data pushes with fine-grained timing, adapt to device availability, and isolate failures. This code repository empowers me with cron support, dependencies, and real-time control for edge devices.

# The Requirements

* `register_pre_post_hooks`          : Run setup logic (network checks, authentication) before polling and cleanup routines after each cycle.
* `cron_expression_support`         : Set up cron-style schedules for sensor reads every five minutes, hourly health stats, and nightly firmware checks.
* `declare_task_dependencies`       : Ensure data aggregation runs only after all regional polls succeed.
* `set_task_priority`               : Give firmware update tasks higher priority to minimize security risk on constrained gateways.
* `control_task_runtime`            : Start, pause, resume, or cancel specific device groups or regional clusters on demand.
* `dynamic_reschedule`              : Adjust polling intervals or update windows in response to battery levels or network congestion.
* `documentation_examples`          : Leverage sample pipelines for MQTT message brokering, edge-to-cloud batching, and auto-scale triggers.
* `one_off_tasks`                   : Schedule single-run diagnostics or emergency firmware pushes at precise datetimes.
* `timezone_awareness`              : Handle device schedules in local time zones or normalize to UTC for centralized control.
* `thread_safe_scheduler`           : Safely manage concurrent polls, updates, and data pushes across thousands of edge nodes.
