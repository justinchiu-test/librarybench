# The Task

I am a Healthcare security operations lead managing PHI-bearing data pipelines. I want to ensure every scheduling, execution, and retry of patient-data transformation tasks is encrypted, auditable, and recoverable under HIPAA. This code repository enforces data protection, audit logs, and operational stability.

# The Requirements

* `EncryptionAtRest`       : Encrypt all patient data snapshots, logs, and intermediate states on disk.  
* `DelayedTaskScheduling`  : Schedule data ingestion, de-identification, and report generation at off-peak hours.  
* `BackupAndRestore`       : Snapshot pipeline state for certified backups and restore during audits or failures.  
* `GracefulShutdown`       : Ensure in-flight PHI transformations complete before workers are redeployed.  
* `DeadLetterQueue`        : Segregate tasks that error on validation or policy checks for manual triage.  
* `MetricsIntegration`     : Send secure metrics on job durations, error rates, and retry counts to Grafana.  
* `UniqueTaskID`           : Ensure each patient-record task is uniquely identified to prevent double processing.  
* `WebDashboard`           : Secure UI for clinicians and auditors to monitor pipeline progress and drill into failures.  
* `AuditLogging`           : Maintain an immutable, tamper-evident log of every enqueue, retry, and cancel event for HIPAA compliance.  
* `CLIInterface`           : Command-line tools for on-call SecOps to enqueue urgent jobs, cancel suspicious tasks, and tail logs.
