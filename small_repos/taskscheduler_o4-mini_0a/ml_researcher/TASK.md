# The Task

I am an ML engineer conducting large-scale hyperparameter sweeps and model training jobs on GPU clusters. I want to orchestrate hundreds of experiments in parallel, monitor resource usage, and automatically retry or terminate unstable runs. This code repository gives me a unified scheduler with rich observability, flexible executors, and safe isolation to keep experiments reproducible and under control.

# The Requirements

* `export_metrics` : Integrate with Prometheus/StatsD to export experiment run counts, GPU/CPU usage, training iteration latencies, and failure rates.  
* `configure_executor` : Switch between process pools, asyncio loops, or multi-threaded executors depending on I/O versus compute intensity.  
* `acquire_distributed_lock` : Use Redis locks to avoid duplicate hyperparameter sweeps when multiple scheduler replicas are deployed.  
* `dashboard_ui` : Web UI to track experiment progress, view logs, compare parameter sets, and inspect retry/failed queues.  
* `attach_log_context` : Add structured context (experiment_id, model_type, run_params) to Python logs for easy querying in ELK or Grafana.  
* `start_api_server` : HTTP endpoints to spin up experiments on demand, fetch real-time metrics, and abort or reprioritize long-running runs.  
* `run_in_sandbox` : Launch each training job in a container or subprocess with GPU/CPU/memory quotas for safe multi-tenant usage.  
* `set_job_priority` : Assign high priority to critical experiments (e.g. production models) so they preempt research jobs on shared resources.  
* `register_lifecycle_hook` : Hooks for cluster initialization (load training data into cache), graceful shutdown (checkpoint models), and cleanup.  
* `serialize_job` : Custom serialization of large tensors and complex configs via msgpack or pickle for cross-node dispatch.
