# The Task

I am a Distributed Systems Engineer building a hybrid on-prem/cloud compute grid. I want a scheduler that handles distributed agents, custom serialization for RPC, dynamic introspection, and resource fencing to keep errant tasks from destabilizing the cluster. This repository supplies a plugin-based scheduler with rich introspection, REST API, and isolation features.

# The Requirements

* `list_jobs(agent_filter='us-west')` : Query tasks assigned to specific agents or regions.  
* `pause_job(job_id)`                : Freeze tasks mid-deployment for troubleshooting.  
* `resume_job(job_id)`               : Thaw paused jobs once issues are resolved.  
* `cancel_job(job_id)`               : Immediately abort problematic deployments.  
* `remove_job(job_id)`               : Clean out retired pipelines.  
* `set_concurrency(job_id, x)`       : Limit parallel shards per job.  
* `set_global_concurrency(y)`        : Control cluster-wide job throughput.  
* `set_priority(job_id, p)`          : Promote critical repairs over bulk data shuffles.  
* `attach_log_context({'job_id','agent_id','region'})` : Enrich logs with agent metadata.  
* `run_in_sandbox(deploy_script, {'cpu':2,'mem':'4GB'})` : Contain build agents in cgroups.  
* `dump_jobs('pgsql://sched_db')`    : Persist schedules in a Postgres backend.  
* `load_jobs('pgsql://sched_db')`    : Reload on scheduler failover.  
* `catch_up_missed_jobs()`           : Re-dispatch tasks skipped during network partitions.  
* `inject_task_context({'trace_id','user','commit_hash'})` : Trace jobs back to code SHA.  
* `serialize_job(payload, 'pickle')` : Pickle complex RPC payloads for cross-process dispatch.  
* `register_executor('grpc', grpc_executor)` : Leverage custom gRPC executors on agents.  
* `start_api_server(host='0.0.0.0', port=7000)` : Offer RESTful endpoints for dashboard and automation.
