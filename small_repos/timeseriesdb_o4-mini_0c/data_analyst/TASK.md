# The Task

I am a data analyst investigating product usage patterns and performance trends. I want to slice and dice time series metrics across geographies and customer segments, export to BI tools, set up automated alerts, and ensure consistent timezone handling. This code repository equips me with the necessary functions to power my dashboards and reports.

# The Requirements

* `export_csv(series_list, start_time, end_time, tag_filters)` : CSV Export – Produce well-formatted CSV dumps of series data for further analysis.  
* `define_alert(alert_name, series_id, condition, severity, notify_channels)` : Alerting & Thresholds – Get notified via email or Slack when KPIs stray outside acceptable ranges.  
* `convert_timezone(query_params, local_timezone)` : Timezone & DST Awareness – Handle conversions between UTC and my local time zone, including DST transitions.  
* `join_series(set_a, set_b, mode, tolerance_ms)` : Multi-Series Joins – Merge web traffic, error rates, and revenue series into unified time-aligned tables.  
* `stream_updates(monitored_series, on_update_callback)` : Real-Time Streaming API – Subscribe to live feeds of new datapoints for real-time charting.  
* `import_csv(csv_path, schema_definition)` : CSV Import – Load archived logs and usage records from CSV into the system.  
* `record_write_history(series_id, change_details, user_email)` : Versioned Data & Audit Trail – Track who changed what when for audit and troubleshooting.  
* `apply_compression(series_id, strategy)` : In-Memory Compression – Reduce RAM usage when visualizing dense historical data.  
* `cache_query_results(query_id, duration)` : Query Caching – Speed up repeated dashboard queries by caching results.  
* `limit_cardinality(series_id, tag_key, limit)` : Cardinality Control – Prevent runaway growth of dimension values in my reports.
