# The Task

I am an ML Researcher managing hyperparameter sweeps and model training jobs. I want to schedule experiments, track failures, visualize dependent steps, and integrate with our monitoring and alerting systems.

# The Requirements

* `rest_api_enqueue` : Expose RESTful endpoints to launch training or evaluation runs, query status, cancel or reprioritize experiments.  
* `concurrency_control` : Limit parallel GPU/CPU jobs globally or per‐research group to fair-share cluster resources.  
* `pluggable_backends` : Swap between local asyncio runners, Kubernetes Job submitter, or custom Slurm plugin.  
* `metrics_exporter` : Push experiment metrics (start/end times, GPU hours, success/failure counts) to Prometheus/Grafana.  
* `hot_config_reload` : Update retry logic, early-stop thresholds, and log verbosity without interrupting ongoing experiments.  
* `plugin_api` : Support custom plugins for experiment serializers, metric reporters, or pre-training data validation.  
* `role_based_access` : Define who can spin up experiments, cancel jobs, or administer the scheduler across teams.  
* `visualize_dag` : Render DAG diagrams of preprocessing → training → evaluation pipelines for reproducibility.  
* `dead_letter_queue_integration` : Send permanently failed experiment tasks to a DLQ for later debugging and re-runs.  
* `cron_scheduler` : Schedule recurring evaluation jobs or nightly retraining tasks using cron syntax or fixed intervals.
