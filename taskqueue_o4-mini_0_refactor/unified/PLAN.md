# Unified TaskQueue Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for a unified TaskQueue system that addresses all the requirements identified in the test files. The implementation will be completely self-contained within the `unified/src` directory and will not reference any code from existing implementations.

## Component Breakdown

The unified TaskQueue system will consist of the following core components:

### 1. Core Components

#### TaskQueue
- Central component that manages task lifecycle
- Handles enqueue, dequeue, complete, fail, cancel operations
- Manages task priorities and dependencies
- Tracks task state transitions

#### Task
- Represents a unit of work with a unique identifier
- Contains payload, service information, and execution metadata
- Tracks dependencies on other tasks
- Supports serialization/deserialization

#### Dispatcher
- Routes tasks to appropriate handlers/backends
- Manages backend registration and selection
- Provides API endpoints for task operations

### 2. Supporting Components

#### Scheduler
- Handles delayed task execution
- Manages time-based scheduling with cron-like capabilities
- Tracks due tasks and schedules them for execution

#### CircuitBreaker
- Prevents cascading failures with downstream services
- Implements failure threshold and recovery timeout logic
- Tracks service health and availability

#### MetricsExporter
- Collects and exports performance metrics
- Tracks task execution times, success/failure rates
- Supports integration with external monitoring systems

#### DeadLetterQueue
- Stores permanently failed tasks
- Provides replay/retry functionality
- Enables failure analysis and debugging

#### AuditLogger
- Records all system events for compliance
- Tracks user actions, task transitions, and system changes
- Supports filtering and querying of audit events

#### Encryption
- Secures sensitive payloads
- Manages encryption/decryption keys
- Ensures data security in storage and transit

#### MultiTenancy
- Isolates tasks between different clients/services
- Manages tenant-specific configuration
- Enforces tenant-level quotas and limits

#### Utils
- Common utilities used across components
- Error handling and validation functions
- Helper methods for common operations

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component will be self-contained with clear interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: Key components will support plugins and extensions
3. **Testability**: Components will be designed for ease of testing
4. **Compatibility**: Implementation will satisfy all test cases
5. **Simplicity**: Core functionality will be simple and focused
6. **Robustness**: Proper error handling and edge cases management

### Implementation Phases

1. **Core Framework**: Implement Task, TaskQueue, and basic operations
2. **Essential Services**: Implement Scheduler, CircuitBreaker, Metrics
3. **Advanced Features**: Implement DeadLetterQueue, Encryption, MultiTenancy
4. **Integration**: Connect components together with clean interfaces
5. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass with the unified implementation

## Dependency Management Strategy

1. **Minimal External Dependencies**: Minimize external library usage
2. **Standard Library Preference**: Use Python standard library where possible
3. **Dependency Injection**: Components accept dependencies in constructors
4. **Interface-Based Design**: Components depend on interfaces, not implementations
5. **Configuration-Driven**: Components are configurable through settings

## Integration with Test Suite

To ensure all tests pass with the unified implementation:

1. All components will implement interfaces expected by tests
2. Import paths in test files will be updated to reference the unified implementation
3. The implementation will maintain API compatibility with existing implementations
4. Edge cases covered in tests will be specifically addressed

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All external inputs will be validated
2. **Secure Defaults**: Security features will be enabled by default
3. **Least Privilege**: Components will operate with minimal required permissions
4. **Sensitive Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive payloads
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing a unified TaskQueue system that addresses all requirements identified in the test files. The implementation will be entirely self-contained within the `unified/src` directory and will not reference any code from existing implementations.
