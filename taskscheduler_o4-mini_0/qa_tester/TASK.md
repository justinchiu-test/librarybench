# The Task

I am a QA Tester building automated regression suites and performance benchmarks. I want to run tests in parallel, collect logs, notify teams on flaky or failing tests, and ensure no test run is lost in CI/CD interruptions. This code repository gives me a powerful scheduler to orchestrate test jobs, plug in custom reports, and catch up on missed test runs.

# The Requirements

* `add_storage_backend`         : Pluggable Storage Backends – persist test results in PostgreSQL or Redis for fast lookups.
* `set_executor`                : Pluggable Executors – distribute tests across multiple processes or run asynchronously for I/O-bound suites.
* `on_pre_execute`              : Pre-Execution Hooks – set up test environment, allocate containers, and seed test data.
* `on_post_execute`             : Post-Execution Hooks – tear down environments, collect logs, and generate coverage reports.
* `add_dependency`              : Task Dependency Graphs – enforce that unit tests finish before integration or system tests start.
* `create_api_endpoint`         : RESTful API Endpoints – trigger ad-hoc test runs, fetch pass/fail counts, or cancel suites.
* `graceful_shutdown`           : Graceful Shutdown & Draining – allow in-flight tests to complete on CI node shutdown.
* `send_alert`                  : Alerting & Notifications – notify on Slack or Teams for regressions or performance threshold breaches.
* `throttle_task`               : Rate Limiting – restrict how often expensive end-to-end suites run to conserve resources.
* `register_lifecycle_hook`     : Signal Handling & Lifecycle Hooks – prepare mocks at startup and clean global fixtures on shutdown.
* `catch_up_missed_runs`        : Missed-Run Catch-Up – replay failed or cancelled tests after CI service restarts.
