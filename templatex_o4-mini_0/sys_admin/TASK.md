# The Task

I am a system administrator automating configuration file generation across hundreds of servers. I want to be able to write Jinja-style templates for Nginx, systemd, and database configs in a secure “safe mode,” include reusable partials, and reliably push out changes at scale without restarting services or risking command injection. This code repository is my templating back-end for all infra as code.

# The Requirements

* `enable_sandbox_mode` : Lock down dangerous built-ins so no malicious template can run arbitrary shell commands.  
* `include(file_path)` : Embed common snippets like virtual host stanzas or service drop-ins via `{% include 'common_ssl.conf.tpl' %}`.  
* `cache_template(path)` : Cache compiled templates on disk to speed up repeated runs of ansible/playbook play.  
* `render_stream(path, ctx)` : Stream large multi-gigabyte log or config outputs without buffering the entire file in memory.  
* `escape_shell(value)` : Built-in shell escaping to prevent command injection in generated scripts.  
* `dot_lookup(ctx, 'services.web.port')` : Access nested keys for dynamic port and host mapping in templates.  
* `minify(output)` : Strip extra whitespace and comments from config files for compact diffs and faster parsing by daemons.  
* `default_filter(value, default)` : Provide fallback values for optional settings (`{{ db_password|default('changeme') }}`).  
* `add_filter('to_yaml', func)` : Custom filter to transform data structures into YAML or other platform-specific formats.  
* `profile_render(path)` : Collect timing metrics on template rendering to identify slow template fragments.
