# The Task

I am a DevOps engineer who templatizes server and application configs (YAML, JSON, INI) across dozens of environments. I want to generate, validate, and stream large configuration files without risking code execution attacks. This code repository helps me define macros for common blocks, safely evaluate parameters, and integrate JSON/YAML filters so I can manage infrastructure as code.

# The Requirements

* `safe_eval`         : Limit template expressions to literals/basic ops to avoid RCE.
* `render_stream`     : Stream out giant config files line by line.
* `scoped_context`    : Keep variable overrides (e.g. per-env) from leaking into global scope.
* `to_json`           : Embed nested objects in JSON blocks.
* `from_json`         : Read JSON fragments for conditional logic.
* `to_yaml`           : Dump parameters or secrets into YAML.
* `from_yaml`         : Parse front-matter or include files safely.
* `report_error`      : Pinpoint syntax errors in config templates with file name & line number.
* `autoescape`        : Escape values by default for XML-based config (e.g. Ant, Maven).
* `raw`               : Bypass escaping for scripts or binary blobs.
* `trim_tags`         : Control whitespace so YAML indentation remains correct.
* `define_macro`      : Factor repeated config blocks into macros (e.g. service definitions).
* `set_delimiters`    : Use alternative delimiters (`<< >>`) to avoid conflict with shell scripts.
* `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`  : Perform arithmetic on port numbers, timeouts, etc.
* `is_even`, `is_odd`          : Branch on numeric flags (e.g. even-odd host indexing).
