- Task definitions with dependencies, timeouts, retry policies, and exponential backoff.
- Workflow compositions with versioning and dependency resolution.
- A task queue to manage execution order.
- A scheduler for time-based (interval) workflow runs.
- A Flask-based API for external integration.
- Comprehensive logging of task execution details.
