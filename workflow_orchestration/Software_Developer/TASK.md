# The Task

I am a Software Developer. I want to automate repetitive tasks and manage complex workflows in my projects. This code repository provides the necessary tools to schedule tasks, handle dependencies, and ensure reliable execution with retries and logging.

# The Requirements

* `Documentation` : Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers to facilitate usage and development.
* `Logging` : Record task execution details, including start time, end time, and log output.
* `Task Timeout` : Define maximum execution time for tasks to prevent indefinite running.
* `Time-Based Scheduling` : Schedule workflows to run at specific intervals, like hourly or daily.
* `Dependency Management` : Specify dependencies between tasks to ensure correct execution order.
* `Retry Policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent failures.
* `API Integration` : Provide an API for external systems to interact with the task management system.
* `Backoff Strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to manage resource usage.
* `Task Queuing` : Implement a queuing system to manage task execution order and resource allocation.
* `Workflow Versioning` : Maintain versions of workflows to track changes and rollback if necessary.
