# The Task

I am a Business Analyst. I want to automate report generation and data analysis tasks to provide insights to stakeholders. This code repository helps me streamline data processing and reporting.

# The Requirements

* `alerting` : Notify me when reports are generated or if there are issues in data processing.
* `conditional_execution` : Generate reports only when new data is available or specific criteria are met.
* `retry_mechanism` : Retry data extraction tasks if they fail, ensuring data accuracy.
* `execution_context` : Share data insights and analysis results between tasks for comprehensive reporting.
* `audit_logging` : Keep a log of all data analysis activities and report generations for future reference.
* `user_interface` : Use a straightforward interface to manage data tasks and view report statuses.
* `task_prioritization` : Prioritize urgent data analysis tasks to meet stakeholder deadlines.
* `task_inputs_outputs` : Pass data analysis results between tasks to build comprehensive reports.
* `security` : Ensure that sensitive data and reports are accessible only to authorized users.
* `time_based_scheduling` : Schedule regular data analysis and report generation tasks to keep stakeholders informed.
