# The Task

I am a Data Scientist. I want to be able to automate and manage complex data processing pipelines efficiently. This code repository helps me ensure that my data workflows run smoothly, even when unexpected issues arise.

# The Requirements

* `task_inputs_outputs` : Allow my data processing tasks to pass datasets and results to each other seamlessly.
* `error_handling` : Implement robust error handling to manage any unexpected failures during data processing.
* `alerting` : Notify me via email or messaging services if a task in my data pipeline fails or if there are significant events.
* `task_states` : Track the state of each task in my pipeline, such as pending, running, success, and failure.
* `metadata_storage` : Store metadata for each task execution, including status and execution time, to analyze performance.
* `execution_context` : Maintain a shared context for tasks to exchange data during execution, ensuring consistency.
* `retry_policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` to handle intermittent failures in data tasks.
* `backoff_strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to manage resource usage effectively.
* `task_timeout` : Define maximum execution time for tasks to prevent them from running indefinitely.
* `dynamic_task_creation` : Allow dynamic creation of tasks based on runtime conditions, such as data size or complexity.
