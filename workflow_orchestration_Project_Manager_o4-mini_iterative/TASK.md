# The Task

I am a Project Manager. I want to ensure that our development team can efficiently manage and execute their tasks. This code repository helps us maintain organized workflows, track execution details, and manage task dependencies.

# The Requirements

* `Documentation` : Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers to facilitate usage and development.
* `Logging` : Record task execution details, including start time, end time, and log output.
* `Task Timeout` : Define maximum execution time for tasks to prevent indefinite running.
* `Time-Based Scheduling` : Schedule workflows to run at specific intervals, like hourly or daily.
* `Dependency Management` : Specify dependencies between tasks to ensure correct execution order.
* `Retry Policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent failures.
* `API Integration` : Provide an API for external systems to interact with the task management system.
* `Backoff Strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to manage resource usage.
* `Task Queuing` : Implement a queuing system to manage task execution order and resource allocation.
* `Workflow Versioning` : Maintain versions of workflows to track changes and rollback if necessary.
