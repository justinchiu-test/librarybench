# Implementation Plan for Workflow Orchestration

## Core Components

1. **Task Representation**
   - Create a Task class with name, function to execute, dependencies, state tracking
   - Support task states: PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE, RETRYING
   - Include retry configuration (max attempts, retry delay)

2. **Workflow/DAG Management**
   - Create a Workflow/DAG class to manage tasks and their relationships
   - Topological sorting to determine execution order respecting dependencies
   - Validate DAG for cycles and missing dependencies

3. **Execution Engine**
   - Run tasks in the correct order based on dependencies
   - Track task states and handle state transitions
   - Implement retry logic with configurable attempts and backoff
   - Propagate failures to dependent tasks
   - Support parallel execution where possible

4. **State Management**
   - Track task states during execution
   - Persist state for resume capability after interruption
   - Provide status reporting for the overall workflow

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Data Models**
   - Create TaskState enum (PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE, RETRYING)
   - Implement Task class with Pydantic
   - Implement Workflow/DAG class with Pydantic

2. **Implement Core Logic**
   - Build topological sort for dependency resolution
   - Create execution engine for running tasks with proper state management
   - Implement retry mechanism with configurable backoff
   - Add failure propagation logic

3. **Create Helper Features**
   - Add task status visualization/reporting
   - Implement workflow validation
   - Add support for timeout handling
   - Create examples demonstrating different workflow patterns

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for complete workflows
   - Test scenarios for retries, failures, and complex dependencies

## MVP Features

- Define tasks with dependencies
- Run tasks in correct order respecting dependencies
- Track task states
- Support retries with configurable parameters
- Propagate failures to dependent tasks
- Provide status reporting
