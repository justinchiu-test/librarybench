# The Task

I am a Product Manager. I want to ensure that our product's backend processes are reliable and efficient, providing a seamless experience for our users. This code repository allows me to oversee and optimize task execution within our system.

# The Requirements

* `cancel_task` : Provide the ability to cancel running tasks if needed, to quickly address any issues that might affect user experience.
* `set_task_timeout` : Define maximum execution time for tasks to prevent indefinite running, ensuring timely completion of backend processes.
* `queue_tasks` : Implement a queuing system to manage task execution order and resource allocation, aligning with business priorities.
* `send_alerts` : Notify me of task failures or significant events via email or messaging services, so I can coordinate with the team to resolve them.
* `schedule_tasks` : Schedule workflows to run at specific intervals, like hourly or daily, to maintain up-to-date product features and data.
* `store_metadata` : Store metadata for each task execution, including status and execution time, to monitor system performance and user impact.
* `retry_failed_tasks` : Implement retries for failed tasks with configurable retry limits, minimizing disruptions to user experience.
* `log_execution_details` : Record task execution details, including start time, end time, and log output, for analysis and strategic planning.
* `configure_retry_policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent failures, ensuring consistent product performance.
* `api_access` : Provide an API for external systems to interact with the task management system, enabling integration with analytics and reporting tools.
