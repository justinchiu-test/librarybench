# The Task

I am a Data Engineer. I want to be able to automate and manage complex data processing workflows efficiently. This code repository will help me ensure that my data pipelines are robust, reliable, and easy to monitor.

# The Requirements

* `retry_mechanism` : Implement retries for failed data processing tasks with configurable retry limits to ensure data integrity.
* `documentation` : Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers to facilitate usage and development of data workflows.
* `backoff_strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to manage resource usage and prevent overwhelming the system.
* `task_states` : Track task states such as pending, running, success, and failure to monitor the progress of data jobs.
* `task_prioritization` : Allow prioritization of tasks to optimize resource allocation and ensure critical data processing tasks are completed first.
* `retry_policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent failures and maintain data pipeline resilience.
* `user_interface` : Develop a user-friendly interface for managing workflows and tasks, making it easy to oversee data processes.
* `security` : Implement authentication and authorization to secure access to the system and protect sensitive data.
* `time_based_scheduling` : Schedule data workflows to run at specific intervals, like hourly or daily, to automate regular data processing tasks.
* `dynamic_task_creation` : Allow dynamic creation of tasks based on runtime conditions to adapt to changing data processing needs.
