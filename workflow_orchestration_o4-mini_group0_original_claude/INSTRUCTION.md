# Unified Workflow Orchestration Implementation

## Task Overview
Your task is to create a unified workflow orchestration implementation that addresses the requirements from three different use cases: Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Product Manager.

## Steps

1. Read and analyze the TASK.md files in each use case directory:
   - `/Data_Engineer/TASK.md`
   - `/Data_Scientist/TASK.md`
   - `/Product_Manager/TASK.md`

2. Create a new `unified` directory at the root level of the project.

3. Copy all tests from each use case directory into `unified/tests/`:
   - Copy all test files from `Data_Engineer/*.py` that start with `test_` into `unified/tests/`
   - Copy all test files from `Data_Scientist/tests/*.py` into `unified/tests/`
   - Copy all test files from `Product_Manager/tests/*.py` into `unified/tests/`
   - Ensure proper imports are maintained by updating import paths as needed

4. Analyze the common functionality, data structures, and interfaces across all three implementations.

5. Design a unified architecture that satisfies all requirements from the three use cases.

6. Implement the unified solution in the `unified` directory with an appropriate file structure that:
   - Includes all necessary modules and packages
   - Maintains compatibility with all test cases
   - Addresses the specific requirements from each TASK.md file
   - Uses consistent naming conventions and coding standards
   - Minimizes code duplication by consolidating similar functionality

7. Ensure that the unified implementation passes all tests copied from the three use cases.

8. Document the architecture, key components, and how the solution addresses each use case's requirements.

The final unified implementation should provide a cohesive workflow orchestration system that satisfies the needs of all three roles: Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Product Manager.
