# The Task

I am a Software Developer. I want to build and manage complex software applications with reliable task execution. This code repository provides the necessary features to ensure my applications run smoothly and handle errors gracefully.

# The Requirements

* `task_inputs_outputs` : Enable software tasks to pass data and results to each other, facilitating modular development.
* `error_handling` : Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected failures in application tasks.
* `alerting` : Notify me of task failures or significant events via email or messaging services to quickly address issues.
* `task_states` : Track the state of application tasks, such as pending, running, success, and failure, for better debugging.
* `metadata_storage` : Store metadata for each task execution, including status and execution time, to analyze performance.
* `execution_context` : Maintain a shared context for tasks to exchange data during execution, ensuring consistency.
* `retry_policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent failures.
* `backoff_strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to manage resource usage effectively.
* `task_timeout` : Define maximum execution time for tasks to prevent them from running indefinitely.
* `dynamic_task_creation` : Allow dynamic creation of tasks based on runtime conditions, such as user input or system state.
