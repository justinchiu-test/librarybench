# The Task

I am a Research Scientist. I want to be able to automate and manage computational experiments efficiently. This code repository will help me ensure that my experiments are reproducible, reliable, and easy to monitor.

# The Requirements

* `retry_mechanism` : Implement retries for failed computational tasks with configurable retry limits to ensure experiment integrity.
* `documentation` : Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers to facilitate usage and development of experimental workflows.
* `backoff_strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to manage resource usage and prevent computational overload.
* `task_states` : Track task states such as pending, running, success, and failure to monitor the progress of experiments.
* `task_prioritization` : Allow prioritization of tasks to optimize resource allocation and ensure critical experiments are completed first.
* `retry_policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent failures and maintain experiment reliability.
* `user_interface` : Develop a user-friendly interface for managing workflows and tasks, making it easy to oversee experimental processes.
* `security` : Implement authentication and authorization to secure access to the system and protect sensitive research data.
* `time_based_scheduling` : Schedule experimental workflows to run at specific intervals, like hourly or daily, to automate regular data collection tasks.
* `dynamic_task_creation` : Allow dynamic creation of tasks based on runtime conditions to adapt to changing experimental needs.
