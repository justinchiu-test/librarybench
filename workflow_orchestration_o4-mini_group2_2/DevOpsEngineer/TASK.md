# The Task

I am a DevOps Engineer. I want to streamline the deployment and management of application tasks across different environments. This code repository provides the tools I need to ensure reliable and efficient task execution.

# The Requirements

* `task_inputs_outputs` : Enable tasks to pass configuration data and results to each other, facilitating smooth deployments.
* `error_handling` : Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected failures during deployment processes.
* `alerting` : Notify me of task failures or significant events via email or messaging services to ensure quick response.
* `task_states` : Track the state of deployment tasks, such as pending, running, success, and failure, for better monitoring.
* `metadata_storage` : Store metadata for each task execution, including status and execution time, to audit deployments.
* `execution_context` : Maintain a shared context for tasks to exchange data during execution, ensuring consistent environments.
* `retry_policies` : Configure `max_retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` for tasks to handle intermittent deployment issues.
* `backoff_strategy` : Implement exponential backoff for retry delays to optimize resource usage during deployments.
* `task_timeout` : Define maximum execution time for tasks to prevent them from running indefinitely during deployments.
* `dynamic_task_creation` : Allow dynamic creation of tasks based on runtime conditions, such as server load or availability.
