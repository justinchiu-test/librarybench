# The Task

I am an IT Administrator. I want to automate and manage routine IT tasks to maintain system health and performance. This code repository helps me schedule, track, and secure IT operations, ensuring that systems are up-to-date and functioning optimally.

# The Requirements

* `Security` : Implement authentication and authorization to secure access to IT scripts and configurations.
* `Workflow Versioning` : Maintain versions of IT workflows to track changes and rollback if necessary, ensuring system stability.
* `Failure Propagation` : Propagate failures to dependent IT tasks to prevent system-wide issues.
* `Task Timeout` : Define maximum execution time for IT tasks to prevent indefinite running and potential system overload.
* `Retry Mechanism` : Implement retries for failed IT tasks with configurable retry limits to handle transient system errors.
* `Task States` : Track task states such as pending, running, success, and failure to monitor IT operations.
* `Task Grouping` : Group related IT tasks for collective execution and management, such as system updates and backups.
* `Time-Based Scheduling` : Schedule IT workflows to run at specific intervals, like nightly backups or weekly updates, to ensure system reliability.
* `Task Queuing` : Implement a queuing system to manage task execution order and resource allocation, optimizing IT operations.
* `Alerting` : Notify me of task failures or significant events via email or messaging services to quickly address system issues.
